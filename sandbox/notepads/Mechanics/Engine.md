## Status Conditions & Overworld Poison Mechanics

- **Overworld Poison Damage**: Overworld poison damage is completely DISABLED in Pokémon Sors v1.3 (aligns with Gen 5+ / CFRU engine rules).

- **Turn-in-Place Mechanic**: There is NO turn-in-place mechanic on foot; pressing a D-Pad direction always turns and attempts a forward step unless blocked by terrain collision.

## Facilities & PokéMarts

- **PokéMarts Inside Pokémon Centers**: In the Hupest region, PokéMarts are integrated directly inside Pokémon Centers on the upper mezzanine floor! Reached via the blue carpeted stairs/escalator in the northwest corner of the center. Verified functional with clerk in Sovio City. (Note: Lancio Town Pokémon Center also features the northwest mezzanine escalator).

- **Bulk Poké Ball Purchases & Premier Ball Mechanic**: In Pokémon Sors, purchasing 10 Poké Balls does NOT grant a bonus Premier Ball.

## Quests & Mission Engine

- **Single Active Quest Limit & Cancellation**: The player can only have ONE active side quest at a time in Pokémon Sors. When attempting to accept a new side quest while one is in progress, the NPC explains: "You are already doing a quest... In order to start a new quest, you need to cancel the one in progress!", followed immediately by an in-dialogue choice prompt: "Would you like to cancel you current quest? Yes/No" (cursor defaults to No).

## HuPhone Regional Device & Apps
- **Access**: Activated via SELECT button or through BAG Key Items pocket.
- **Main App Menu**:
  1. **Item Storage**: Launches portable PC terminal (contains Item Storage, Mailbox, Turn Off).

     - **Dynamic Banners**: Hovering over location nodes displays town/route names and subtitles in top-left (e.g., "Sovio City / Metro Station", "Amor City / Amor Dept.", "Route 4", "Route 16").
     - **Player Location Pin**: Asher's current position is tracked by a yellow pin with a black tip.
     - **Interactivity & Fast Travel**: Node interaction with button 'A' is inert; no fast travel or town info cards exist. The World Map functions strictly as a regional topological reference.
     - **Controls**: D-pad moves cursor; START button immediately snaps cursor to bottom-right '[X]' ('Close Map'); pressing A on '[X]' or B button exits back to the HuPhone menu.

## Pokémon Center Respawn Mechanics

- **Whiteout / Blackout Respawn Point**: Respawn points are set only when speaking to Nurse Joy at the counter to heal. Simply entering a Pokémon Center without talking to Nurse Joy does NOT register a new checkpoint.

## Verified Inventory State & Field Move Capabilities

- **Items Pocket (Audited Turn 27826)**: Contains Poison Barb x1, Antidote x1, Repel x8, Revive x1, Max Repel x1, Berry Juice x5, Moomoo Milk x5 (purchased 5 Berry Juice and 5 Moomoo Milk at Claire's Organic Market in Azluf Town in Turns 27825-27826 with ₽3410 remaining; found Max Repel at Route 2 `60, 37` in Turn 27744; found hidden Revive at Route 2 `48, 35` in Turn 27705).
- **Repel Auto-Renewal Prompt**: When an active Repel expires on a step, the engine automatically displays: "Repel's effect wore off... Use another? Yes/No" (cursor defaults to Yes; pressing A immediately consumes and applies the next Repel without opening the Bag, verified Turn 27448).
- **Bag Structure (Audited Turn 27862)**: Features 3 main horizontal pockets from left to right: **Items** (Pocket 1), **Key Items** (Pocket 2), and **Poké Balls** (Pocket 3; does not wrap around when pressing Right).
- **Poké Balls Pocket (Audited Turn 27913)**: Empty (used 6 standard Poké Balls and 1 Timer Ball to catch wild Lv4 Gligar on Route 2 in Turns 27907-27913; restock at Sovio City PokéMart).
- **Key Items Pocket (Audited Turn 27862)**:
  - **HuPhone** (registered to `[SELECT]`): *"A convenient smartphone that has many features to use."*
  - **TM Case**: *"A case that holds TMs and HMs. It is attached to the Bag's compartment for important items."*
  - **Metro Pass**: *"Its a card that can be used at the e-ticket reader gates to travel on the Hupest Metro Line."*
  - **Eclipse Band**: *"A special band designed to channel the power of Eclipse Shards to allow Eclipsing!"* (received from Professor Ivo in Azluf Town, Turn 27799).
  - **Fishing Rod**: *"A new, high-quality fishing rod. Use it by any body of water to fish for wild Pokémon."* (received from Fisherman at `37, 30` in Azluf Town, Turn 27854). Casting into water prints `. . .` dots and automatically resolves to either *"A Pokémon's on the hook!"* (requiring a single A/B press to start the wild battle, with no timing minigame) or *"Not even a nibble..."* (verified Turn 27865).
- **TMs & HMs Pocket**: Contains only TM17 (Protect) and TM48 (Work Up). Zero HMs in possession.

- **Empirical Constraint & Equipment Mechanic**: Interacting with cracked/rugged rocks in Sovio Sewers displays verbatim: "It's a rugged rock, but with some equipment, I could smash it." Confirmed that smashing rugged rocks is mechanic-gated by specialized equipment rather than traditional HM Rock Smash (verified at `6, 23` and `22, 10` in Sovio Sewers, Turns 27495 & 27512).

## Trainer Card Structure & Display
- **Front Layout**: Name (Asher), ID No. (54592), Money, Playtime. Features '*ROUNDS' row tracking 8 Poké Ball icons for the Eclipse Tournament.
- **Back Layout**: Displays 6 dark badge/crest silhouettes, red geometric stripes, and regional circular crest.
- **Card Controls**: Pressing A on either side initiates a 3D flip animation between Front and Back. Pressing B when settled on the Front exits back to the Start Menu.
## Start Menu Structure & Pokédex Status
- **Start Menu Entries**: Displays Pokédex, Pokémon, Bag, Asher (Trainer Card), Save, Option, Exit.
- **Empirical Pokédex Status & Special Function**: Asher received the **PokéDex** from Professor Ivo in Azluf Town in Turn 27801 (commissioned for Asher by Jackson). In addition to standard entries, the PokéDex registers the **stats**, **abilities**, and **habitat** of caught Pokémon (verified Turn 27802).
- **Pokédex Table of Contents (Audited Turn 27859)**: Tracks `Seen` and `Owned` counts across two regional dex categories (`Colen` and `Hupest`), with 54 Hupest species and 17 Colen species pre-marked as `Seen` upon receipt.
- **In-Game Real-Time Clock**: Displayed in top-left HUD box when Start Menu is open; synchronizes with host system clock.
- **TM Reusability**: Confirmed infinite use in Pokémon Sors v1.3; TM48 (Work Up) remains in the TM Case after being taught to Sirius.

## Custom Emulator SDK & Sandbox Execution Limits
- **Script Button Accumulator Limit**: The sandbox Python environment enforces a cumulative session limit on button commands executed via Python scripts/mgba. When this limit is reached, any script attempting button commands will abort with 'Maximum cumulative limit of 100 buttons per script execution exceeded'. Controller button commands should strictly use the native press_buttons tool.
- **Tool Limitation (stun_npc)**: The `stun_npc` tool fails with 'Error: Map objects data is unavailable' on this ROM/engine build. Do not invoke `stun_npc`.
## Hupest Metro Line Transit Mechanics
- **Boarding the Train**: With the **Metro Pass** in the Key Items pocket, stepping into a station's entry turnstile lane (e.g. `17, 24` in Amor Metro Station, verified Turn 27572) prompts *"Do you want to use the Hupest Metro Line? Yes/No"*. Selecting *Yes* walks the player onto the platform into the train car (`11, 8`) with the announcement *"Please mind the closing doors!"* (verified Turn 27574).
- **Train Interior Layout (`cols 1-24, rows 4-8`, verified via `latest_grid.png` Turns 27575, 27578, 27581)**:
  - **Western Car (`cols 1-6`)**: Green door mat at `(2-4, 8)` (inert while moving); elderly man at `(1, 8)` (*"The Hupest Metro Lines are very famous for foreigners..."*, Turn 27581); Italian woman at `(3, 5)` (*"Vengo da una regione lontana! E tu?"*, Turn 27581); German man at `(4, 8)` (*"Früher waren Spiele originell!..."*, Turn 27581).
  - **West Gangway (`7-8, 7`)**: Connects Western and Middle cars along row 7; glasses passenger at `(7, 6)` (*"He's texting something on a messaging app... 'Day 69 of asking for a dating sim in sors.'"*, Turn 27576).
  - **Middle Car (`cols 9-14`)**: Green door mat at `(10-12, 8)` (arrival spawn at `11, 8`); Hungarian blonde girl at `(9, 5)` (*"Kíváncsi vagyok mikor jön ki a Pokémon Sors teljes verziója..."*, Turn 27580); passenger at `(14, 6)` refreshing a game site showing a fella in a red fedora talking to a Darkrai (Turn 27578).
  - **East Gangway (`15-16, 7`) & Eastern Car (`cols 17-22`) & Far-East Gangway (`23-24, 7`)**: Green door mat at `(18-20, 8)`; Japanese passenger in Team Siara suit at `(22, 8)` (*"Watashi wa Joto kara kimashita..."*, Turn 27578); eastern end terminates at `(24, 7)` (Turn 27579).
- **Selecting a Destination Inside the Train Car (`4, 5` Seat Trigger)**: Stepping `Left` from `(5, 5)` into the purple passenger seat at `(4, 5)` sits Asher down and opens the prompt: *"Which city do you want to go to?"* with a destination list of 8 stations (`Amor`, `Sovio`, `Samurion`, `Destino`, `Galinor`, `E.S.`, `Colen`, `Dis Bay`). Selecting a station not yet unlocked displays *"You can't go to that city yet!"* (verified Turn 27582), while selecting an unlocked station such as `Sovio` announces *"The next station is... Sovio City!"* and warps to the destination station platform (`22, 17` in Sovio Metro Station, verified Turns 27583-27584).

## Battle UI & Type Effectiveness Indicators
- **Move Box Effectiveness Highlighting**: In the CFRU battle Fight menu, the selected move's box dynamically changes color to indicate type effectiveness against the active opponent (e.g. highlights **light green** when a move is super-effective, such as Steel-type Metal Claw against Fairy-type Cleffa or Psychic/Fairy-type Ralts; verified Turn 27656).
