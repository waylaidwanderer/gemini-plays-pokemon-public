## Status Conditions & Overworld Poison Mechanics

- **Overworld Poison Damage**: Overworld poison damage is completely DISABLED in Pokémon Sors v1.3 (aligns with Gen 5+ / CFRU engine rules).

- **Turn-in-Place Mechanic**: There is NO turn-in-place mechanic on foot; pressing a D-Pad direction always turns and attempts a forward step unless blocked by terrain collision.

## Facilities & PokéMarts

- **PokéMarts Inside Pokémon Centers**: In the Hupest region, PokéMarts are integrated directly inside Pokémon Centers on the upper mezzanine floor! Reached via the blue carpeted stairs/escalator in the northwest corner of the center. Verified functional with clerk in Sovio City. (Note: Lancio Town Pokémon Center is single-story; contains no mezzanine staircase or PokéMart vendor).

- **Bulk Poké Ball Purchases & Premier Ball Mechanic**: In Pokémon Sors, purchasing 10 Poké Balls does NOT grant a bonus Premier Ball.

## Quests & Mission Engine

- **Single Active Quest Limit & Cancellation**: The player can only have ONE active side quest at a time in Pokémon Sors. When attempting to accept a new side quest while one is in progress, the NPC explains: "You are already doing a quest... In order to start a new quest, you need to cancel the one in progress!", followed immediately by an in-dialogue choice prompt: "Would you like to cancel you current quest? Yes/No" (cursor defaults to No).

## Pokémon Center Respawn Mechanics

Confirmed that smashing rugged rocks is mechanic-gated by specialized equipment rather than traditional HM Rock Smash.
