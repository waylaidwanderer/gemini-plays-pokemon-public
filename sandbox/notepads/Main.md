## Key Tactical Rules (Learned from Attempts #1–#4)
- **Deterministic Bounded 2x2 Move Selection (Verified Turn 328):** Opening the Bag or Party menu in the overworld resets the in-battle move cursor to Slot 1 (`Tackle`). Because the 2x2 move grid does not wrap, **ALWAYS press `Down, Right` for Slot 4 (`Water Gun`), `Up, Right` for Slot 2 (`Bubble`), and `Up, Left` for Slot 1 (`Tackle`)**!
- **Starter Claims Route 101 (Verified Turn 141):** Because the starter's summary reads `Met in ROUTE 101`, the Nuzlocke harness treats Route 101 as already used and blocks Poké Ball throws on Route 101.
- **Lowered Wild Catch Rates & Crit Range Rule (Turns 158–161, 252, 293):** Poké Balls thrown at **Green HP (`>50%`)** pop out on Shake 0 in this ROM. Always weaken wild encounters into **Yellow (`<50%`) or Red (`<20%`) HP** before throwing a Poké Ball, and immediately `RUN` if HP drops into `2x` enemy attack damage (crit range).
- **Modified Move Mechanics (Turns 169, 384):**
  - `Yawn` inflicts Sleep (`SLP`) immediately on the turn it is used.
  - `Silver Wind` (`Ledyba` on Route 103) has a **100% omni-boost rate** (`+1 Atk/Def/SpA/SpD/Spd` on every hit).
- **Route 102 Trainer Teams (Verified Turns 177–182, 303–328):**
  1. **Youngster Calvin `(33, 14)`:** 3 Lv. 6 Pokémon (`Sentret` [Assist->Rock Smash, Quick Attack], `Zigzagoon` [Swift], `Poochyena` [Rock Smash, Howl]).
  2. **Bug Catcher Rick `(25, 15)`:** 4 Lv. 5 Pokémon (`Caterpie`, `Wurmple`, `Kakuna`, `Cascoon` [holds `Berry Juice`]).
  3. **Lass Tiana `(15, 5)`:** 2 Lv. 6 Pokémon (`Igglybuff` [`Cute Charm` contact infatuation, holds `Oran Berry`, uses `Present` — **MUST use non-contact `Water Gun` (`Down, Right`)!**], `Sunkern` [`Mega Drain` 40 BP Grass, 2x super effective vs Water — **enter at >25 HP with held Oran Berry and use `Tackle` (`Up, Left`)!**]).
  4. **Youngster Allen `(13, 2)`:** Faces `Down` at the western exit of Route 102.
- **Oldale Mart Prices (Turn 153):** Poké Balls cost only **$10** each (10+ awards a Premier Ball); Potions cost $300; Antidotes cost $100.
- **Heal in Overworld to 100% HP & Equip Oran Berries:** Bag Potions cannot be used in battle, but held `Oran Berries` (`(24, 2)` on Route 102) activate automatically in battle!
- **Train Caught Teammates to Lv. 8–10 Before Route 102 Trainers:** Never bring a base-level (Lv. 4) catch into Route 102 trainer battles. Train any Route 103 / Route 102 catch up to **Lv. 8–10** alongside the starter before challenging Route 102's trainers.
