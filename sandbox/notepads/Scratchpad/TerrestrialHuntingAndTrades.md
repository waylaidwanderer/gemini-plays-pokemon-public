## Stone Evolution Strategy & Movepool Hypotheses [Unverified]
- In Generation 1 retail, stone-evolved Pokémon learn ZERO moves via level-up after stone application (with very few exceptions, e.g. Exeggutor's Lv 28 Stomp).
- Pre-evolutions must reach key levels before stone application if specific moves are needed for battle utility:
  - Weepinbell: Delay evolution until Level 38 for Razor Leaf.
  - Gloom: Delay evolution until Level 38 for Petal Dance or Level 44 for Solarbeam.
  - Jigglypuff: Delay evolution until Level 34 for Rest or Level 39 for Double-Edge.
- Pokédex-Only Speed Strategy: Immediate stone application upon capture is optimal to minimize training time when battle movesets are unneeded.

## PC Terminal Interface Observation & Empirical Testing Audit (Turns 43226–44131)
- State Description: Player at (13, 4) in Cerulean Pokémon Center facing PC terminal at (13, 3). Screen displays nested UI (Bill's PC, Party list with PUFF selected, 'What?', DEPOSIT/STATS/CANCEL submenu with cursor at DEPOSIT).
- Core Status: Storing Wigglytuff (PUFF) is abandoned. Active party is 3/6 (Mewtwo Lv 75, Rattata Lv 3, Wigglytuff Lv 3). Primary progression milestone is training Rattata to Lv 20 at Cerulean Cave 1F.
- Consolidated Empirical Findings: Across all controller inputs tested (all 8 standard buttons individually, R/L buttons, multi-button confirmations, cancellations, directional pairings, system toggles, neutral release cycles, and timed delays), the nested PC submenu consistently displays 0 pixel delta across all intermediate and final frames. No differential input filtering or selective button responsiveness has been observed.
