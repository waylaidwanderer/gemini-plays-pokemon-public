# Pokémon Mansion - Multi-Floor Switch & Barrier Permutations

## Global Switch Mechanics & Rules (Empirically Verified)
1. **Global Toggle**: Any Mewtwo statue switch flips ALL floors simultaneously between State A (Default) and State B (Toggled).
2. **Exterior Reset**: Leaving the Pokémon Mansion (via front door or DIG) immediately and reliably resets all switches globally to State A (Default). (Verified Turn 18942 via DIG).

## Empirical Barrier State Matrix

| Floor | Barrier Location | State A (Default) | State B (Toggled) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1F | Shutter at (24..25, 13) [Enclosed Wing to B1F Stairs] | **OPEN** | CLOSED (Verified Turn 18520, 18673, 18935) |
| 1F | Shutter at (26..27, 27) [Southeast Shutter Barrier] | **CLOSED** (Verified Turn 19115) | **OPEN** (Verified Turn 19115) |
| 2F | Doorways at (4, 7) and (6, 7) | **OPEN** (Verified Turn 18581) | CLOSED |
| 2F | Shutter at (21, 17) [West-East Divider] | **CLOSED** (Verified Turn 18601) | OPEN |
| 2F | Shutter at (26..27, 27) [Southeast Corner] | **CLOSED** (Verified Turn 18598) | OPEN |
| 3F | Shutter at (15, 10..11) | **CLOSED** | OPEN (Verified Turn 18658, 18898) |

## Balcony Pit Drop Empirical Matrix (3F -> Destination)
| Departure Tile (Floor 3F) | Landing Tile (Floor, X, Y) | Resulting Area / Access | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3F (16, 14) [Left Pit Drop] | 1F (16, 14) | 1F South Wing (TM03, Scientist Ted) | Confirmed (Turns 18495, 18661) |
| 3F (17, 14) [Left/Center Pit Drop] | 1F (16, 14) | 1F South Wing (TM03, Scientist Ted) | Confirmed (Turn 18902) |
| 3F (19, 14) [Right Pit Drop] | 1F (18, 14) | 1F Northern Landing Sector (Journal at (18, 2), Pillar at (15, 11)) | VERIFIED (Turn 19000) |

## Active Strategy: Accessing Enclosed East Wing via 1F (26..27, 27) in State B
1. Mansion is currently in State B.
2. In State B, shutter gate at 1F (26..27, 27) is OPEN.
3. Walk from 1F (26, 4) -> row 3 -> col 18 -> row 10 -> Central Hall (cols 4-7).
4. Walk South down Central Hall to row 27 -> East to (26, 27) -> enter through open shutter gate.
5. Systematically explore the Enclosed East Wing to locate the true B1F staircase.
