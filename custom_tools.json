It takes the coordinates of the player, Farfetch'd, and apprentice, and calculates the next optimal position for the player to interact with the Farfetch'd to herd it towards the apprentice. This addresses the critique about using agents for computational tasks.",

The previous version was based on an incorrect herding assumption and did not check for traversable tiles, causing it to suggest invalid moves. This new version reads the map_xml_string to identify adjacent, passable, and unoccupied tiles around the Farfetch'd, returning a list of valid coordinates to interact from. This addresses the critical failure identified by the overwatch system and provides a robust tool for systematically testing puzzle hypotheses.",
