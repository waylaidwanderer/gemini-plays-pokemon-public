The previous logic for handling elevation changes was flawed and failed to prevent invalid moves between `ground`, `elevated_ground`, and connector tiles like `cleared_boulder_barrier`. This commit completely rewrites the elevation logic within the `is_traversable` function. It now uses a dictionary to assign elevation levels to relevant tile types and only permits movement between adjacent levels (e.g., ground to steps, steps to elevated_ground), explicitly forbidding direct jumps between ground and elevated_ground. This is a critical fix to prevent the tool from generating invalid paths in Victory Road.",
