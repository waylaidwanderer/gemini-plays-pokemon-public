        "commit_message": "feat: Implement boulder_puzzle_solver. This tool automates solving boulder puzzles using an A* search algorithm. It analyzes the map state, including player position, boulder locations, and impassable tiles, to find a sequence of moves to push a target boulder to a target switch. This is a critical addition to my toolset, addressing a major roadblock in Victory Road 1F and automating a complex, repetitive computational task, as recommended by the overwatch system.",
