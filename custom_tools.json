In response to an Overwatch critique, this commit replaces the unreliable `auto_switcher` with a new, single-step tool. This tool calculates only the next required directional press, making it robust against the 'Party Menu Cursor Anomaly' by allowing for re-evaluation of the cursor's position each turn. This is a critical fix to prevent future switch errors.",
