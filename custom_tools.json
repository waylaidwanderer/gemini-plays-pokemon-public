The tool was failing because the map data's 'has-object' flag does not update for hidden items after they are picked up. This commit updates the `is_passable` logic to check for a '✅' map marker on any tile with an object. If the marker is present, the tile is treated as passable, resolving the bug and allowing correct navigation through areas with collected hidden items.",
