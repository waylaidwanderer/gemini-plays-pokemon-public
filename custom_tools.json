In response to the complex Seafoam Islands puzzle and an Overwatch critique, this tool automates the solution-finding process for boulder puzzles. It uses a Breadth-First Search algorithm to explore all possible states (player and boulder positions) to find the optimal sequence of moves to push all boulders into their corresponding holes. This will eliminate manual trial-and-error, which is inefficient and error-prone, and adheres to the directive to automate complex reasoning tasks.",
