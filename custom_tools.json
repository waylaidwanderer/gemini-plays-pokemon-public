It finds a path to a valid tile adjacent to the target wall, faces the wall, and presses 'A'. This directly addresses the inefficiency and recent hallucination error identified during the mandatory self-assessment, improving both the speed and reliability of the ongoing puzzle-solving effort.",

The tool previously failed silently, making it impossible to diagnose why it couldn't find a valid path that other tools could. This commit adds detailed print statements to log exactly why each potential neighbor tile is being rejected or accepted, which is essential for identifying and fixing the root cause of the pathfinding failure.",

This commit replaces the buggy A* implementation with the simpler, more reliable BFS logic adapted directly from the `plan_path_to_target` tool, which is known to function correctly in this environment. This should resolve the persistent pathing failures.",
