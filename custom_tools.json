The BFS was using a simplified and incorrect rule for ledge traversal, causing it to fail to explore paths along adjacent ledge tiles of the same type. This resulted in the tool incorrectly reporting unreachable areas as reachable because it would 'leak' its search across impassable ledge boundaries. The logic has been updated to match the corrected, more robust rules from the `find_path_to_target` tool, ensuring the reachability check is accurate.",
