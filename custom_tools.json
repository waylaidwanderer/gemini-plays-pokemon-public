This commit refines the `validation_check_generator` tool to correctly calculate `is_in_dead_end_area` by grouping adjacent warps as a single exit. It also improves the calculation of `navigable_warps` and `reachable_connections_count` to align with the system's definition of reachability for dead-end checks. This addresses the recurring 'Dead End Area Mismatch' critical warnings and ensures more accurate self-assessment.",
