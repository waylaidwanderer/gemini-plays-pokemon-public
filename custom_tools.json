This tool automates the repetitive task of parsing the map XML to gather all necessary data (player position, boulders, switches, etc.) and formats it into the correct JSON structure required to call the `puzzle_strategist_agent`. This was identified as a key process improvement during self-reflection, as it streamlines puzzle-solving and reduces the chance of manual error.",

This commit updates the script to parse the XML, create a simplified grid layout dictionary, and pass that structured data to the agent instead. This corrects the architectural flaw and makes the tool compliant.",
