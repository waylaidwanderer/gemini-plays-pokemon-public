# General Mechanics & Controls
- Verified basic game mechanics, controls, and UI behaviors.

## Battle Mechanics:
- Turn-based combat. First starter battle triggers immediately after selecting starter and rival picking theirs.
- Lead Pokémon (first slot) is automatically sent out first.
- HP (Hit Points) represents health. Our starter SQUIRTLE (GEMMY) starts with 20 max HP.
- Moves have PP (Power Points) representing usage limits. SQUIRTLE's Tackle has 35 PP, Tail Whip has 30 PP.

## Overworld Navigation:
- PC in player's room can store items. Potion withdrawn on Turn 62 successfully.
- Warps (stairs, doors) transition between maps and are activated by walking onto them.

## Ledge Mechanics:
- Ledges (TYPE_44f6) are one-way drop-offs.
- Verified on Turn 262: Moving South (Down) from (10, 4) to (10, 6) over a ledge at (10, 5) successfully jumps over the ledge.
- Moving North (Up) against a ledge is impassable.

## Pokémon Center Counter Mechanics:
- Test 4: Left Counter Tile Interaction Check
  - **Hypothesis**: The player can interact with Nurse Joy from (3, 3) facing Up (the left counter tile) to heal their Pokémon, bypassing the blocking NPC at (4, 3).
  - **Methodology**:
    - Turn 1679: Standing at (3, 3) facing Up.
    - Action: Press 'A' to interact with the counter directly above us at (3, 2).
    - Verification: Check if Turn 1687 state shows the Pokémon Center healing dialogue on screen.
  - **Results**:
    - Turn 1687: Successfully verified! The screen shows "Shall we heal your POKéMON?" and the interactive menu `▶HEAL / CANCEL` is open, with the cursor pointing at `▶HEAL`.
    - **Conclusion**: Confirmed! In Generation 1, you can talk to Nurse Joy and heal your Pokémon from the left counter tile (3, 3) facing Up. You do not need to stand in the center (4, 3). This is an incredibly useful mechanic to bypass any NPC blocking the center counter spot.

## Verified Route 2 Mechanics:
### Test 1: Red Flower Tile Collision Check
- **Hypothesis**: Red flower tiles (visually red flowers, system tile type `TYPE_3fe2`) are passable and do not block player movement.
- **Results**: Verified on Turn 1042. Player successfully moved from (4, 66) to (5, 66) (a red flower tile). Red flower tiles are passable.

### Test 2: Route 2 Southern Tall Grass Patch Wild Encounters Check
- **Hypothesis**: Tall grass tiles (TYPE_3fe2) in the southern portion of Route 2 (Columns 8 & 9, Rows 61-67) contain wild Pokémon encounters.
- **Results**: Completed on Turn 1411. Player took 42 cumulative steps on these tiles between Turn 1052 and Turn 1411 without triggering a single wild encounter. Consistently negative. Encounters on this specific grass patch are either disabled or extremely rare.

### Test 3: Route 2 Northern Tall Grass Patch Wild Encounters Check
- **Hypothesis**: The TYPE_fed7 tall grass patch (starting at Y=51, Columns X=4 to X=9) contains active wild encounters.
- **Results**: Completed on Turn 1554. On Turn 1537, at 13 cumulative steps, we triggered a wild Level 4 PIDGEY encounter (captured as BIRBIE). The northern tall grass patch contains active wild encounters.
## Gen 1 Battle Move Menu Structure Insight (Turn 4492 Verification):
- In Pokémon Red/Blue, the battle moves menu is a single vertical column of 4 moves, NOT a 2x2 grid.
  - Position 1 (top): Move 1 (TACKLE)
  - Position 2: Move 2 (TAIL WHIP)
  - Position 3: Move 3 (BUBBLE)
  - Position 4 (bottom): Move 4 (WATER GUN)
- The moves menu remembers its last selected position. If you used Move 2 last round, the cursor starts on Move 2.
- The menu allows wrapping. Pressing Up on the 1st move wraps down to the 4th move. Pressing Down on the 4th move wraps up to the 1st move. Verified on Turn 4492!
