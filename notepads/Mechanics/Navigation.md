# Navigation Mechanics
- ALWAYS read the TYPE_ annotations on the screen grid instead of blindly guessing why movement failed. Ledges and fences require visual confirmation.
- Ledges (e.g. TYPE_44f6) enforce one-way movement. Route 5 requires looping back to the top to access the right-side lanes.
- Building identities must be verified by entering them, not by visual assumption. Saffron Gate and Underground Path are visually similar.
- Do NOT blindly trust assumed long-distance coordinate math (e.g. 'walk straight south from X'). Walk step-by-step and trace impassable tiles (water, trees) to find correct paths.
- When mapping, use exact coordinates and do not jump to conclusions about blocked paths until physically bumping into them. Use map markers to explicitly mark entrances!
- Protocol: When taking a ladder or door, immediately stop, verify the new Map ID, and step OFF the warp tile before using automation tools.
[Dig/Teleport Mechanics]
- Dig and Escape Ropes return you to the last Pokemon Center where you ACTUALLY HEALED your Pokemon. Simply entering and exiting a Pokemon Center does NOT set the warp point. You must speak to Nurse Joy and complete the healing dialogue. (Proved Turn 55685 when Dig warped me from Unknown Dungeon back to Pallet Town because I skipped healing in Cerulean City).
