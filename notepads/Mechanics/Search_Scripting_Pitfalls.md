# Search Scripting Pitfalls

## Turn 79 Baseline Drift Pitfall
- **Description:** When running navigation scripts, if you execute a sequence of movements and then a reset sequence without first verifying that the initial movements were successful (e.g. they weren't blocked by a wall, NPC, or wild battle), the actual position of the player will drift from the expected position.
- **Prevention:** Always verify that each step or sequence of steps succeeded (checking GameState coordinates and screen visual) before continuing or executing corrective/reset steps.
