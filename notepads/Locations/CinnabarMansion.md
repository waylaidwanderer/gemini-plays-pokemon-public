# Pokémon Mansion (Cinnabar Mansion) Exploration Records (Map Region)

## Core Puzzle Mechanics & Safety Rules
- **Switch Statues**: Throughout the Mansion, there are Mewtwo statues with switches inside them.
  - Interacting with a statue toggles the state of gates (doors with iron bars) throughout the floor or building.
  - Status check: There are two types of gates: **Open Gates** and **Closed Gates**.
  - Statues toggle these states: when one type opens, the other type closes.
- **Floors**:
  - **1F**: Entry floor. Contains stairs to 2F.
  - **2F**: Second floor. Contains stairs to 1F, stairs to 3F, and several balconies/falls.
  - **3F**: Third floor. Contains stairs to 2F, and specific fall-down spots (pits/ledges) that drop the player to lower floors (including B1F!).
  - **B1F**: Basement floor. This is where the **Secret Key** is hidden.
- **Escape Strategy**: Once we find the Secret Key, we can use an **Escape Rope** from our bag to immediately warp out of the Mansion. We currently have 1 Escape Rope in our bag.
