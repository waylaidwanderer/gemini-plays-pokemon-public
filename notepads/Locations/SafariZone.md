WARNING: EXECUTE ROUTES IN 3-5 STEP CHUNKS ONLY. Long macros cause accidental ledge jumps and desyncs.
- Limit: 500 steps.

[Map Connections (TWO-WAY LOOP!)]
- Area 1 Center (0_220) <-> Area 2 East (0_217) [via East Exit at 29,10 <-> 0,22]
- Area 1 Center (0_220) <-> Area 3 North (0_218) [via North Exit at 15,0 <-> South Exit at 20,35]
- Area 2 East (0_217) <-> Area 3 North (0_218) [via Northwest Exit at 0,4 <-> Southeast Exit at 39,30/31]
- Area 3 North (0_218) <-> Area 4 West (0_219) [via Southwest Exit at 8..15, 35 <-> Northeast Exit at 26, 0]

[AREA 4 WEST EXPLORATION ROUTE - THE TRUE PATH]
1. The entrance from Area 3 North's Southwest Exit (drops at 26, 0 in Area 4 West) is a DEAD END ROUTE. It only leads to the East Grass, Dirt Trench (ends at X=5), the North Pocket (ends at Y=6), and the South Grass Trap (loops back to Area 1).
2. HYPOTHESIS: The TRUE entrance to the functional part of Area 4 West (where the Secret House is) must be located on the WEST edge of Area 3 North, North of Y=23.
3. STRATEGY: Navigate to Area 3 North, cross the upper lake (North of Y=9), and explore the far West edge of Area 3 North to find this entrance.

[KNOWN TRAPS & DEAD ENDS]
- Area 4 West Trap Ledges: Jumping ledges at (14, 17) or (24, 17) traps you in the southern path, forcing an exit to Area 1 Center.
- Area 1 Center West Pocket: Exiting Area 4 West via (29, 22) drops you here. Walk West at (0, 11) to re-enter Area 4 West.
- Area 4 West Y=4 Path: DOES NOT EXIST. Hallucinated. X=24 is a solid tree wall.

[CURRENT STRATEGY: VERIFY AREA 1 CENTER WEST]
- [Turn 31894] Overwatch flagged a critical hallucination: I never physically tested the tiles at Y=15/16 on the West side of Area 1 Center (X=0 to X=5) for a gap North.
- [Turn 31908] EMPIRICAL PROOF OBTAINED:
  - Walked along Y=17 from X=6 to X=2, systematically pressing UP. Bumped into solid bushes (TYPE_2889) at (5, 16), (4, 16), (3, 16), and (2, 16).
  - Attempted to walk West from (2, 17). Blocked by a large solid tree occupying (0, 16)-(1, 16) and (0, 17)-(1, 17).
  - CONCLUSION: There is absolutely no gap North on the West side of Area 1 Center. The wall is 100% solid.

[FINAL PROVEN LAYOUT FACTS]
- TRUE PATH TO SECRET HOUSE: In Area 3 North, cross the Northern edge (Y=1..3) from X=28 to X=1. Walk South down the 1-tile wide path at X=1. Enter the gap at (2, 35). This places you at (20, 0) in Area 4 West. Walk West along Y=4 to reach the Secret House at (3, 3) and the Gold Teeth at (19, 7).
- AREA 1/2 CHOKEPOINTS: Area 1 West is fully blocked. Area 2 requires using the South Dirt Plateau (stairs at 20,21 to 12,21) to bridge over the tree walls.
