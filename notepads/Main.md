[Location Encounters]
(Moved to Archive/LocationEncounters)

[Lessons Learned]
- Avoid over-mashing A during map transitions and battles. It causes UI desyncs, mistaken menu inputs, and turn hallucinations. Use targeted tools instead.
- Always carry Antidotes when exploring caves to prevent retreating from Poison damage.
- Map markers for defeated trainers (e.g. ☠️) should ONLY be placed AFTER returning to the overworld, never during a battle.
- If an item is not explicitly listed in the Game State Information sprite list, it DOES NOT EXIST.
- NEVER use dead reckoning. ALWAYS read the Game State Player Position before making any navigational assumptions.
- Gen 1 PC menus (DEPOSIT, WITHDRAW, etc.) retain cursor memory.
- Gen 1 Battle menus retain cursor memory! Reset the main menu cursor to FIGHT by pressing Up and Left before navigating.

[Vermilion City]

[Plan]
- Find the Silph Scope to see the Ghost Pokemon in Pokemon Tower. The Silph Scope is located in the Rocket Hideout beneath the Game Corner. Do not search other buildings for it.
- Find Mr. Fuji, who is missing from his Volunteer Pokemon House.

[HMs]
- HM01 (Cut): Taught to Audrey (Bellsprout).
- HM05 (Flash): Obtained! Tested party + Diglett, Dugtrio, Meowth, Voltorb - none can learn it. Abandoned finding a Flash user; navigating via grid is faster.

[Route 10]
- Found a Pokemon Center right next to Rock Tunnel entrance! This is a great place to heal and grind if needed.

[Rocket Hideout]
- Current Focus: Explore B4F to find the Elevator Key and reach the Team Rocket Boss.
- System Note: Gen 1 move menu WRAPS. Mashing 'Up' DOES NOT guarantee index 1. Must use `current_move_index` based on visual confirmation or tracking memory.
[Rocket Hideout]
- Elevator Mechanics: The elevator is its own room. The elevator doors on B1F are at (24, 16). They must be accessed from the SOUTH side (Y=17).
- Elevator Route: B1F South and B2F bottom-right are dead ends. The B1F elevator doors at (24, 16) MUST be accessed from B1F North by standing at (24, 15) and pressing A to open them.
- Next Steps: Dig out to Celadon City. Return to B1F North (24, 15) and press A on the elevator doors. If that fails, search B2F near the start (24, 11) for an elevator!
[Turn 11866] 50-Turn Reflection:
- Progress: Discovered B1F South and B2F South-East are dead ends. Used Dig to escape.
- Next Action: Re-enter Game Corner and test accessing the B1F elevator doors from the North side (24, 15) by pressing A.
