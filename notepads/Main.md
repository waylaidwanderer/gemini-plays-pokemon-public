[Location Encounters]
(Moved to Archive/LocationEncounters)

[Lessons Learned]
- Avoid over-mashing A during map transitions and battles. It causes UI desyncs, mistaken menu inputs, and turn hallucinations. Use targeted tools instead.
- Always carry Antidotes when exploring caves to prevent retreating from Poison damage.
- Map markers for defeated trainers (e.g. ☠️) should ONLY be placed AFTER returning to the overworld, never during a battle.
- If an item is not explicitly listed in the Game State Information sprite list, it DOES NOT EXIST.
- NEVER use dead reckoning. ALWAYS read the Game State Player Position before making any navigational assumptions.
- Gen 1 PC menus (DEPOSIT, WITHDRAW, etc.) retain cursor memory.
- Gen 1 Battle menus retain cursor memory! Reset the main menu cursor to FIGHT by pressing Up and Left before navigating.

[Vermilion City]
- Fan Club: (9, 13) - Talk to Chairman for Bike Voucher.

[Plan]
- Find the Silph Scope to see the Ghost Pokemon in Pokemon Tower. The Silph Scope is located in the Rocket Hideout beneath the Game Corner. Do not search other buildings for it.
- Find Mr. Fuji, who is missing from his Volunteer Pokemon House.

[HMs]
- HM01 (Cut): Taught to Audrey (Bellsprout).
- HM05 (Flash): Obtained! Tested party + Diglett, Dugtrio, Meowth, Voltorb - none can learn it. Abandoned finding a Flash user; navigating via grid is faster.

[Route 10]
- Found a Pokemon Center right next to Rock Tunnel entrance! This is a great place to heal and grind if needed.

[Rocket Hideout]
- Current Focus: Explore B4F to find the Elevator Key and reach the Team Rocket Boss.
- System Note: Gen 1 move menu WRAPS. Mashing 'Up' DOES NOT guarantee index 1. Must use `current_move_index` based on visual confirmation or tracking memory.
[Rocket Hideout]
- True Route to Elevator: B1F (23, 2) stairs -> B2F Maze -> B2F (21, 22) stairs -> B1F South (21, 24) -> Walk to Elevator Pad at (24, 19).
[Turn 11397] 50-Turn Reflection:
- Progress: Confirmed the true path to the B1F elevator is via the Game Corner entrance. The blast doors at Y=18 open automatically!
- Error: Hallucinated a dead end because of a pathfinding tool limitation. Blindly trusting tools without verifying map tiles visually is dangerous.
- Next Steps: Navigate to Game Corner, enter B1F, take the elevator to B4F, and retrieve the Silph Scope.
