[Location Encounters]
(Moved to Archive/LocationEncounters)

[Lessons Learned]
- Avoid over-mashing A during map transitions and battles. It causes UI desyncs, mistaken menu inputs, and turn hallucinations. Use targeted tools instead.
- Always carry Antidotes when exploring caves to prevent retreating from Poison damage.
- Map markers for defeated trainers (e.g. ☠️) should ONLY be placed AFTER returning to the overworld, never during a battle.
- If an item is not explicitly listed in the Game State Information sprite list, it DOES NOT EXIST.
- NEVER use dead reckoning. ALWAYS read the Game State Player Position before making any navigational assumptions.
- Gen 1 PC menus (DEPOSIT, WITHDRAW, etc.) retain cursor memory.
- Gen 1 Battle menus retain cursor memory! Reset the main menu cursor to FIGHT by pressing Up and Left before navigating.

[Vermilion City]
- Fan Club: (9, 13) - Talk to Chairman for Bike Voucher.

[Plan]
- Find the Silph Scope to see the Ghost Pokemon in Pokemon Tower. The Silph Scope is located in the Rocket Hideout beneath the Game Corner. Do not search other buildings for it.
- Find Mr. Fuji, who is missing from his Volunteer Pokemon House.

[HMs]
- HM01 (Cut): Taught to Audrey (Bellsprout).
- HM05 (Flash): Obtained! Tested party + Diglett, Dugtrio, Meowth, Voltorb - none can learn it. Abandoned finding a Flash user; navigating via grid is faster.

[Route 10]
- Found a Pokemon Center right next to Rock Tunnel entrance! This is a great place to heal and grind if needed.

[Rocket Hideout]
- Current Focus: Explore B4F to find the Elevator Key and reach the Team Rocket Boss.
- System Note: Gen 1 move menu WRAPS. Mashing 'Up' DOES NOT guarantee index 1. Must use `current_move_index` based on visual confirmation or tracking memory.
[Rocket Hideout]
- CRITICAL EPIPHANY 6: The B1F elevator doors are at (24, 13) and (25, 13) facing DOWN! I was one tile away earlier but hallucinated they were at Y=16. 
- TRUE PATH TO SILPH SCOPE:
  1. Enter Hideout B1F (21, 2).
  2. Navigate to the right side of the map at X=28.
  3. Walk down to (28, 14) and left to (24, 14).
  4. Walk UP into the elevator doors at (24, 13).
  5. Take Elevator to B4F and pick up Silph Scope!
