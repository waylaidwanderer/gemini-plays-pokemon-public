[Location Encounters]
(Moved to Archive/LocationEncounters)

[Lessons Learned]
- Avoid over-mashing A during map transitions and battles. It causes UI desyncs, mistaken menu inputs, and turn hallucinations. Use targeted tools instead.
- Always carry Antidotes when exploring caves to prevent retreating from Poison damage.
- Map markers for defeated trainers (e.g. ☠️) should ONLY be placed AFTER returning to the overworld, never during a battle.
- If an item is not explicitly listed in the Game State Information sprite list, it DOES NOT EXIST.
- NEVER use dead reckoning. ALWAYS read the Game State Player Position before making any navigational assumptions.
- Gen 1 PC menus (DEPOSIT, WITHDRAW, etc.) retain cursor memory.
- Gen 1 Battle menus retain cursor memory! Reset the main menu cursor to FIGHT by pressing Up and Left before navigating.

[Vermilion City]
- Fan Club: (9, 13) - Talk to Chairman for Bike Voucher.

[Plan]
- Find the Silph Scope to see the Ghost Pokemon in Pokemon Tower. The Silph Scope is located in the Rocket Hideout beneath the Game Corner. Do not search other buildings for it.
- Find Mr. Fuji, who is missing from his Volunteer Pokemon House.

[HMs]
- HM01 (Cut): Taught to Audrey (Bellsprout).
- HM05 (Flash): Obtained! Tested party + Diglett, Dugtrio, Meowth, Voltorb - none can learn it. Abandoned finding a Flash user; navigating via grid is faster.

[Route 10]
- Found a Pokemon Center right next to Rock Tunnel entrance! This is a great place to heal and grind if needed.

[Rocket Hideout]
- Current Focus: Explore B4F to find the Elevator Key and reach the Team Rocket Boss.
- System Note: Gen 1 move menu WRAPS. Mashing 'Up' DOES NOT guarantee index 1. Must use `current_move_index` based on visual confirmation or tracking memory.
[Rocket Hideout]
- CRITICAL EPIPHANY 8: I solved it. The elevator is on B1F at (24, 16) facing DOWN. It can ONLY be accessed from B1F South (24, 17).
- My mistake earlier: I arrived at B1F South (21, 22) and walked straight RIGHT, hitting the wall at X=23. I forgot there is a gap in the wall further DOWN at Y=24!
- TRUE PATH TO SILPH SCOPE:
  1. Take B1F stairs (23, 2) to B2F.
  2. Navigate B2F maze to reach B1F South via stairs at B2F (21, 22).
  3. Arrive at B1F (21, 22). WALK DOWN to Y=24, then RIGHT to X=24, then UP to (24, 17).
  4. Step UP into the elevator at (24, 16)!
  5. Ride to B4F, defeat boss, get Silph Scope.
