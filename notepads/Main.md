[Location Encounters]
(Moved to Archive/LocationEncounters)

[Lessons Learned]
- Avoid over-mashing A during map transitions and battles. It causes UI desyncs, mistaken menu inputs, and turn hallucinations. Use targeted tools instead.
- Always carry Antidotes when exploring caves to prevent retreating from Poison damage.
- Map markers for defeated trainers (e.g. ☠️) should ONLY be placed AFTER returning to the overworld, never during a battle.
- If an item is not explicitly listed in the Game State Information sprite list, it DOES NOT EXIST.
- NEVER use dead reckoning. ALWAYS read the Game State Player Position before making any navigational assumptions.
- Gen 1 PC menus (DEPOSIT, WITHDRAW, etc.) retain cursor memory.
- Gen 1 Battle menus retain cursor memory! Reset the main menu cursor to FIGHT by pressing Up and Left before navigating.
- Gen 1 Move menu cursor memory is retained when switching Pokemon, but RESETS to index 1 at the start of a NEW battle!
- The Game State Info inventory list is alphabetized, but the in-game bag is NOT. Do not rely on Game State indices to find items.
- The overworld Start Menu ALSO retains cursor memory! Always check where the cursor is before blindly executing navigation sequences.
- When menu state desyncs or cursor memory causes an error, ALWAYS back out entirely to the overworld (spam B) and start fresh. Do not try to "fix" it mid-menu blindly.

[Timestamps]
- Route 6 / Vermilion Grinding Start: Turn 4321
- Route 11 Exploration Start: Turn 6409
- S.S. Anne Boarding: Turn 4431 (Tue Feb 24 2026)

[Plan]
- Explore Route 12 south towards Fuchsia City.
- Find a Poke Mart to restock on Poke Balls.
- Catch new Pokemon on Route 12.

[HMs]
- HM01 (Cut): Taught to Audrey (Bellsprout).
- HM05 (Flash): Obtained! Tested party + Diglett, Dugtrio, Meowth, Voltorb - none can learn it. Abandoned finding a Flash user; navigating via grid is faster.

[Exploration Notes]
- System Note: Gen 1 move menu WRAPS. Mashing 'Up' DOES NOT guarantee index 1. Must use `current_move_index` based on visual confirmation or tracking memory.
- NEVER assume a path is blocked based on visual patterns (like fences). ALWAYS physically test every tile along the suspected barrier by bumping into it to confirm if there is a hidden gap.
- Encountered Lv 30 Snorlax on Route 12. Failed to catch due to running out of Poke Balls. Defeating it to clear the path. Must stock up before the next static encounter!
- Custom tools cannot read the screen mid-execution (no while loops for visual feedback).
- Skull Bash is a 2-turn move (Turn 1: lowers head, Turn 2: attacks).
- Always visually confirm the item name under the cursor before pressing A in the item menu, as the bag is not alphabetized and indices change.
