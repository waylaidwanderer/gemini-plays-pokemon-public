## Notepad Management Protocol (One-In, One-Out)
- To adhere to the 10 loaded notepad limit:
  1. Before loading a new region's notepad, audit current active notepads.
  2. If the loaded count is 9 or 10, identify completed/distant regions (e.g., SSAnne, VermilionCity) to unload.
  3. Execute `unload_notepads` to archive completed notepads before loading new ones.

## Active Progression Plan
