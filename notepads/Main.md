## Rules & Learnings
- **mgba.get_coordinates() Warning:** Returns `{'x': 0, 'y': 0}` in some emulator/harness states. Do NOT trust it for spatial tracking in scripts. Use the injected `GameStateInformation` coordinate report in the system prompt instead.
- **Map Transition Verification:** Always verify map transitions visually (checking surrounding objects/NPCs) and by watching for the `SYSTEM NOTE: Map Transition Detected` injection, rather than assuming a movement was successful.
