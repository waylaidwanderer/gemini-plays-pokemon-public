# Saffron City & Silph Co. Systematic Warp-Logging Strategy

## Overview & Cognitive Safeguards
Saffron City and Silph Co. (11 floors) contain a massive, complex network of over 30 warp tiles. Navigating this blindly or relying purely on short-term memory will cause cognitive bloat, backtrack loops, and wasted turns. To prevent this, we will systematically log every warp transition using our specialized custom agent: `warp_network_tracker`.

## Logging Protocol
1. **Identify and Check**: Before stepping on any warp tile, verify our current map ID and coordinate.
2. **Execute and Record**: Step on the warp tile. Once we spawn at the destination, immediately:
   - Call the `warp_network_tracker` agent with `action_type="record_warp"`.
   - Provide `current_map_id`, `current_position` (the warp's origin), and `warp_destination_map_id`, `warp_destination_position` (the spawn location).
3. **Verify in Scratchpad**: Maintain a secondary high-level floor transition index in this scratchpad to maintain quick overworld context.
4. **Route Planning**: When seeking specific objectives (like finding the Card Key on B5F, or reaching Giovanni on 11F), call `warp_network_tracker` with `action_type="plan_warp_route"` to query the database and receive an automated sequence of coordinates to follow.

## High-Level Floor-by-Floor Silph Co. Objectives
- **Target 1**: Obtain the Card Key (traditionally on 5F or adjacent floors).
- **Target 2**: Unlock doors using the Card Key to access locked rooms and valuable items.
- **Target 3**: Defeat Boss Giovanni on 11F to clear Silph Co. Defeating Giovanni here will clear Team Rocket from Saffron City and unlock the Saffron Gym!
- **Target 4**: Defeat Sabrina at Saffron Gym.

## Active Route & Progress Log
- **Turn 38726**: Captured Snorlax at Route 16 (26, 10). Nicknamed SNOOZY and sent to PC Box 1.
- **Turn 38744**: Returned to overworld. Initiated walk east back to Celadon City to heal.
- **Turn 38751**: Entered Celadon City at (0, 18).
- **Turn 38777**: Reached (10, 14) in front of Celadon Dept Store. Heading east along Row 14 toward Celadon Pokémon Center at (41, 9).
