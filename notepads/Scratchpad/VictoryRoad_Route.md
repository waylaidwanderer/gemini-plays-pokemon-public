# Scratchpad: Victory Road Route & Puzzle States
- Started: Turn 96968 (pre-entry routing)

## Party Overworld HM Dependencies & Readiness:
- **SURF (HM03)**: Known by GEMMY (BLASTOISE) (Slot 1, Level 64). Fully functional.
- **STRENGTH (HM04)**: Known by ROCKY (GEODUDE) (Slot 2, Level 15). Fully functional.
- **FLY (HM02)**: Known by BIRBIE (PIDGEOTTO) (Slot 3, Level 18). Fainted but overworld FLY is usable!
- **CUT (HM01)**: Known by PETAL (BELLSPROUT) (Slot 6, Level 13). Fully functional.

## Puzzle Mechanics & Reset Rules (Generation 1):
- **Strength Deactivation**: Moving through stairs/warp transitions completely deactivates the active overworld STRENGTH state. It MUST be manually reactivated from the POKéMON menu upon entering a new floor.
- **Boulder Position Reset**: Transitioning between maps/floors or using DIG/Escape Rope completely resets all boulders on all floors back to their default starting coordinates.
- **Switch Retention**: Standing off a switch usually resets it, but some permanent switches (like plates that open gates) stay pressed once the boulder is pushed onto them. If we leave the floor, they reset.

## Puzzle State Log:

### Victory Road 1F (Map 0_108):
- **Active State**: Completed (Boulder on Switch)
- **Boulders Database**:
  - Boulder A: Initial (5, 15) | Current (17, 13) | Target (17, 13) | Status: [x] Active (secured with Switch A)
  - Boulder A2: Initial (14, 2) | Current (10, 2) | Target (10, 2) | Status: [ ] Active

### Victory Road 2F Map (Map 0_194):
- **Active State**: Completed (Backtracked to 3F)
  - **Current Position**: (23, 8) facing Down (Turn 101089)
- **Strength Status**: Active: [ ] False

### Victory Road 2F Boulders & Switches:
- **Boulders Database**:
  - Boulder B1: Initial (5, 5) | Current (5, 5) | Status: Unmoved
  - Boulder B2: Initial (4, 14) | Current (1, 16) | Status: [x] Pushed onto Switch B1
  - Dropped Boulder: Initial (23, 16) | Current (9, 16) | Status: [x] Pushed onto Switch B2 again (Turn 100581) after floor transition reset
- **Floor Switches**:
  - Switch B1: Coordinate (1, 16) | State: [x] Pressed (secured with Boulder B2)
  - Switch B2: Coordinate (9, 16) | State: [x] Pressed (secured with Dropped Boulder)

### Victory Road 3F Map (Map 0_198):
- **Active State**: In Progress
  - **Current Position**: (13, 7) facing Left (Turn 101104)
- **Boulders Database**:
  - Boulders are reset back to default starting positions (boulder C2 at (24, 10), boulder C4 at (13, 12)).
- **Floor Switches & Holes**:
  - Pit Hole: Coordinate (23, 15) | State: Open [x] (verified on Turn 100130, boulder dropped through)
  - Switch C1: Coordinate (3, 5) | State: Pressed [x]

### Empirical Push Test Failure & Pivot Log (Turn 99693):
- **Verification of Failure**: On Turn 99678, with Boulder C1 resting on Switch C1 at (3, 5), the player attempted to push Boulder C3 at (7, 7) southwards from (7, 6). The push failed due to a solid collision bump, and tiles (7, 8) and (7, 9) remain TYPE_2889 rock walls.
- **Conclusion**: Switch C1 at (3, 5) does NOT open the Column 7 gates. Its function is elsewhere, likely lowering a barrier on the East or Northeast side of 3F.
- **Active Strategy**: Pivot immediately to Contingency A. Walk East along the Row 1 corridor to investigate if any eastern or northeast barrier was lowered, or if there is another switch/trigger on the East side.
## Elite Four & Champion Preparation Plan (Blizzard PP Strategic Response - Turn 100193):
- **Observation**: GEMMY (BLASTOISE) has 0 PP remaining on Blizzard, which is our prime move for sweeping dragons.
- **Strategic Constraint**: DIG/FLY/Escape Rope to heal at a Pokémon Center or retrieve MAX ETHER from the PC will completely reset all solved boulder puzzles on 1F, 2F, and 3F, forcing us to redo them.
- **Strategic Plan**:
  1. Complete the 2F boulder puzzle and Victory Road to reach Indigo Plateau without leaving.
  2. Avoid fighting wild encounters by running (flee_battle) to conserve remaining Surf (8 PP), Hydro Pump (5 PP), and Earthquake (4 PP).
  3. Once we reach Indigo Plateau, heal the entire team at the Pokémon Center, restoring all HP and PP (including Blizzard) to full, and retrieve any needed items from the PC before entering the Elite Four lobby.
- **Gemmy's Remaining PP Limits (Turn 100329)**:
  - Surf: 8/15 PP
  - Hydro Pump: 5/5 PP
  - Earthquake: 4/10 PP
  - Blizzard: 0/5 PP (Strategic reserve: will heal at Indigo Plateau PC)

## Active Progress & Current Plan (Turn 100987):
- **Current Task**: Drop down the open pit hole at (23, 15) on 3F, land on 2F's ground floor, and walk West to the exit ladder at (0, 8).
- **Step-by-Step Plan**:
  - Step Down to (23, 8) and back Up to (23, 7) to trigger warp to 3F.
  - On 3F, navigate to the open pit hole at (23, 15).
  - Drop down to 2F.
  - Walk West to (0, 8).
  - Session Start Turn: 100951 | Resumed: Turn 100987 | Timestamp: Wednesday June 17, 2026 4:45 PM PDT (Time-blindness protection active)
- Turn 101063: Tested walking Down from (21, 11) [z=1] to (21, 12) [z=0]. Result: Bumped (0 tiles visited), remaining at (21, 11). This empirically proves that the transition from Row 11 (red checkered) to Row 12 (purple) is a solid height mismatch barrier on Column 21 as well, and we cannot descend directly to the purple floor on the east side on foot. We must walk West on the red checkered floor (Row 11) to find the correct descent path.
