# Scratchpad: Victory Road Route & Puzzle States
- Started: Turn 96968 (pre-entry routing)
- Goal: Navigate Victory Road, solve boulder puzzles, and reach Indigo Plateau.

## Party Overworld HM Dependencies & Readiness:
- **SURF (HM03)**: Known by GEMMY (BLASTOISE) (Slot 1, Level 63). Fully functional.
- **STRENGTH (HM04)**: Known by ROCKY (GEODUDE) (Slot 2, Level 15). Fully functional.
- **FLY (HM02)**: Known by BIRBIE (PIDGEOTTO) (Slot 3, Level 18). Note: Birbie is currently fainted (0/55 HP), but overworld FLY remains fully usable!
- **CUT (HM01)**: Known by PETAL (BELLSPROUT) (Slot 6, Level 13). Fully functional.

## Puzzle Mechanics & Reset Rules (Generation 1):
- **Strength Deactivation**: Moving through stairs/warp transitions completely deactivates the active overworld STRENGTH state. It MUST be manually reactivated from the POKéMON menu upon entering a new floor.
- **Boulder Position Reset**: Transitioning between maps/floors or using DIG/Escape Rope completely resets all boulders on all floors back to their default starting coordinates.
- **Switch Retention**: Standing off a switch usually resets it, but some permanent switches (like plates that open gates) stay pressed once the boulder is pushed onto them. If we leave the floor, they reset.
