# Scratchpad: Victory Road Route & Puzzle States
- Started: Turn 96968 (pre-entry routing)
- Goal: Navigate Victory Road, solve boulder puzzles, and reach Indigo Plateau.

## Party Overworld HM Dependencies & Readiness:
- **SURF (HM03)**: Known by GEMMY (BLASTOISE) (Slot 1, Level 63). Fully functional.
- **STRENGTH (HM04)**: Known by ROCKY (GEODUDE) (Slot 2, Level 15). Fully functional.
- **FLY (HM02)**: Known by BIRBIE (PIDGEOTTO) (Slot 3, Level 18). Note: Birbie is currently fainted (0/55 HP), but overworld FLY remains fully usable!
- **CUT (HM01)**: Known by PETAL (BELLSPROUT) (Slot 6, Level 13). Fully functional.

## Puzzle Mechanics & Reset Rules (Generation 1):
- **Strength Deactivation**: Moving through stairs/warp transitions completely deactivates the active overworld STRENGTH state. It MUST be manually reactivated from the POKéMON menu upon entering a new floor.
- **Boulder Position Reset**: Transitioning between maps/floors or using DIG/Escape Rope completely resets all boulders on all floors back to their default starting coordinates.
- **Switch Retention**: Standing off a switch usually resets it, but some permanent switches (like plates that open gates) stay pressed once the boulder is pushed onto them. If we leave the floor, they reset.

## Puzzle State Log:

### Victory Road 1F (Map 0_108):
- **Active State**: Unexplored / Initial
- **Boulders Database**:
  - Boulder A: Initial (TBD, TBD) | Current (TBD, TBD) | Target (TBD, TBD) | Status: [ ] Active
- **Floor Switches**:
  - Switch A: Coordinate (TBD, TBD) | State: [ ] Pressed (requires Boulder A)
- **Sliding Log / Push Vectors**:
  - *Format*: Push [Direction] from (X, Y) to (X_new, Y_new) on Turn [N].

### Victory Road 2F:
- **Active State**: Unexplored / Initial
- **Boulders Database**:
  - Boulder B: Initial (TBD, TBD) | Current (TBD, TBD) | Target (TBD, TBD) | Status: [ ] Active
- **Floor Switches**:
  - Switch B: Coordinate (TBD, TBD) | State: [ ] Pressed (requires Boulder B)

### Victory Road 3F:
- **Active State**: Unexplored / Initial
- **Boulders Database**:
  - Boulder C: Initial (TBD, TBD) | Current (TBD, TBD) | Target (TBD, TBD) | Status: [ ] Active
- **Floor Switches**:
  - Switch C: Coordinate (TBD, TBD) | State: [ ] Pressed (requires Boulder C)

## Socratic Challenge: Strength & Puzzle Management Protocol
- **Strength Deactivation Tracker**:
  - Floor transitions (stairs/warps) completely deactivate overworld STRENGTH.
  - Upon entering any floor, we will log: `Floor: [Floor Name] | Turn: [Turn Number] | Strength Active: [ ] False (Needs Reactivation)`.
  - We will activate STRENGTH from the POKéMON menu using ROCKY (Geodude).
  - We will verify the exact text indicators: `ROCKY used STRENGTH!` and `ROCKY can move boulders.`.
  - Only after confirming this text will we log: `Strength Active: [x] True`.
- **Boulder Push Vector Meticulous Logging**:
  - To prevent being trapped or making irreversible incorrect pushes, every single push will be logged before moving further:
    - *Format*: `Turn [N]: Pushed [Boulder ID] [Direction] from (X, Y) to (X_new, Y_new) while standing at (X_player, Y_player) facing [Facing]`.
  - If a puzzle becomes unsolvable or we get stuck, we will immediately use a stairs transition to reset all boulder coordinates and STRENGTH state, updating our logs accordingly.
## Live Progression & Route Logs:
- **Turn 97482**: Successfully initiated SURF on water at (11, 103) facing Up. Surfing North along Column 11 toward the Soul Badge checkpoint at Y=96.
