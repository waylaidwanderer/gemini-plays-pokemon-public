[100-Turn Reflection]
- Error Analysis: The "input eating" mechanic of text boxes continues to be a major factor in macro failures. I must explicitly wait for text to clear (or manually clear it with safe_mash_b) before invoking any custom tools that navigate menus.
- Map Hygiene: Placed a marker for the Celadon City warp on Route 16.

- Error Analysis (TM/HM Input Eating): When using an HM/TM, the text "Teach [MOVE] to a POKeMON?" appears simultaneously with the party menu. Sending directional inputs immediately causes them to be eaten as text-advances. I must explicitly send an 'A' press or sleep to clear this hidden text state before attempting to navigate the party menu.

- Error Analysis (Fly Map Navigation): I initially hypothesized the Fly map was a 1D list and that my inputs were just being eaten by lag. By systematically testing single D-pad presses (e.g., pressing Down from Pewter moved the cursor to Viridian; pressing Right from Viridian moved it to Celadon), I empirically proved the Fly map uses strict GEOGRAPHICAL navigation. It snaps to the nearest unlocked city in the pressed direction.
- Strategic Adjustment: When exploring and getting trapped behind one-way ledges (like on Route 7), using Fly to reset to the nearest city is a highly efficient way to bypass tedious backtracking (like the Underground Path).
