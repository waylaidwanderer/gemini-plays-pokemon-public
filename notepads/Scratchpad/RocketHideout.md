## Path to B4F Rocket Grunt 1 (Lift Key) (Turn 36199 - Active)
- Path from (19, 10) to (22, 12) next to Grunt:
  1. From (19, 10), walk Left to (18, 10).
  2. Walk Down 6 times to (18, 16).
  3. Walk Right 4 times to (22, 16).
  4. Walk Up 4 times to (22, 12).
  5. Face Right to talk to the Grunt at (23, 12) and initiate battle.
- This path has been verified using full-map BFS and accounts for all physical boundaries.
## Passability Test: Row 16 on B4F (Turn 36245)
- Hypothesis: (18, 16) is solid TYPE_2889, despite the path in this scratchpad suggesting we can walk down to (18, 16) and right to (22, 16).
- Test Method: From (18, 14), press Down twice to try to reach (18, 16).
- Result: TBD.
