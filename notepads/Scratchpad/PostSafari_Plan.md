# Post-Safari Zone Route & Progression Plan (Cinnabar Mansion)

## Cinnabar Mansion Deep B1F Routing & Switch Matrix (Turn 78160)
- **Active Exploration Mission**: Locate and retrieve the Secret Key on B1F.
- **State A (Statue 2 Default)**:
  - Gate 1 on 1F (25, 13) is CLOSED, blocking foot access to the Southeast room.
  - Gate 3 on 2F (18, 8)-(19, 8) is OPEN (Verified OPEN on Turn 78836).
  - Gate 4 on 1F East (21, 17) is OPEN.
  - Gate 6 on 2F (9, 4)-(9, 5) is CLOSED.
  - Gate 18 on 2F (2, 18) is CLOSED.
  - Gate 26 on 2F (12, 26)-(13, 26) is CLOSED.
  - Gate 13 on 2F (12, 13)-(13, 13) is CLOSED.

- **State B (Statue 2 Toggled)**:
  - Gate 1 on 1F (25, 13) is OPEN, allowing foot access to the Southeast room.
  - Gate 3 on 2F (18, 8)-(19, 8) is CLOSED (Verified CLOSED on Turn 84976).
  - Gate 4 on 1F East (21, 17) is CLOSED.
  - Gate 6 on 2F (9, 4)-(9, 5) is OPEN.
  - Gate 18 on 2F (2, 18) is CLOSED?
  - Gate 26 on 2F (12, 26)-(13, 26) is CLOSED.
  - Gate 13 on 2F (12, 13)-(13, 13) is CLOSED.

## State B Southeast Room Isolation Verification (Turn 85829 Verification)
- **Hypothesis**: The Southeast room (Columns 25-28) of 1F East is completely isolated on foot from the B1F stairs at (21, 23) under State B.
- **Methodology**: Stood at (25, 21) on Turn 85829 and visually analyzed the surrounding tile map:
  - Column 24 has a solid wall of TYPE_2889 extending vertically on Rows 19-23.
  - Column 24 and 25 have solid rubble of TYPE_2889 at (24, 24), (25, 24), and (25, 25).
  - Therefore, there is no horizontal pathway connecting Column 25 and Column 21 on the south side.
- **Definitive Conclusion**: The Southeast room of 1F East is indeed completely isolated on foot from the rest of 1F. We cannot reach B1F stairs under State B from this room. We must explore the room to find a staircase or transition under State B.

## B1F Access Plan (State B Staircase Route)
- **Socratic Progress**:
  - We have verified that the 3F West-East crossover is completely solid/blocked under both State A and State B, and the 2F Southeast room is isolated. Thus, there must be a way to climb directly from 1F Southeast to 2F Southeast.
  - Under State B, Gate 1 at (25, 13) is open, granting full access to the Southeast room on 1F East.
  - We are systematically searching every passable tile in the Southeast room of 1F East (Columns 25-28, Rows 14-25) under State B to locate this active staircase.
  - Once located, we will climb to 2F Southeast, ascend the stairs at (25, 14) to 3F East, and drop down the correct side of the pit to B1F.
- **Current Coverage Progress**:
  - Row 21: (25, 21), (26, 21), (27, 21), (28, 21) [Fully Tested - Solid floor]
  - Row 22: (25, 22), (26, 22), (27, 22), (28, 22) [Fully Tested - Solid floor]
  - Row 23: (25, 23), (26, 23), (27, 23), (28, 23) [Fully Tested - Solid floor]
  - Row 26: (26, 26), (27, 26) [Fully Tested - Solid floor]
  - Row 25: (26, 25), (27, 25), (28, 25) [We just stood on (27, 25) and (28, 25) - Solid floor]
  - Row 24: (28, 24) [We just stood on (28, 24) - Solid floor]
- **Immediate Next Steps**:
  - Stand on (27, 24) and (26, 24) to complete Row 24 and Row 25 coverage on the southern half.
  - Move north to systematically cover Rows 14-20 on Column 25, 26, 27, 28.

## Cinnabar Mansion Breakthrough Exploration Phase (Turn 79491)
- **Verified Fact**: 2F East South Column 22 is completely solid/rubble under both State A and State B across rows 8-15. This separates Column 21 from Column 23 on these rows.

- **B1F Mapping Protocol**:
  - Once in B1F, we will walk along every passable tile, logging items, statues, and gates.
  - We will record all B1F gates and switch dependencies in `Scratchpad/Mansion_Gate_Matrix` using our structured circuit matrix format.

### 3F East Pit-Mapping Spatial Safety Protocol (Added Turn 79515)
- **The Risk**: Overworld pit tiles (such as TYPE_21ec, visually dark voids) trigger immediate, irreversible map transitions/falls upon step contact. Rushing can result in an accidental fall before mapping is complete.
- **Safety Protocol**:
  1. Once we cross into the eastern wing on 3F East, we will limit all movements near boundaries or unfamiliar areas to **1-tile chunks** (pressing only one directional button at a time).
  2. We will verify the screen and tile labels after every single step.
  3. We will NEVER step blindly onto any tile that has not been confirmed to be a standard floor tile (such as TYPE_3fe2).
  4. We will systematically map the coordinates of all walls, balconies, and pit boundaries from a safe distance before choosing which pit to fall into.

## Socratic Socratic Answers (Turn 79575)
### Socratic Question 1: 3F East Pit Landing & Escape Protocol
- **Historical Note (State B)**: Under State B, we previously analyzed dropping to the 1F south-central pocket. However, physical testing has proved that Column 24 is a solid wall on Rows 19-24 and Gate 4 is closed under State B, meaning the 1F Southeast room is completely isolated on foot from the B1F stairs. Therefore, the State B Pit Drop Route is disproven.

### Socratic Question 3: Basement Switch Architecture (B1F)
- **Mapping Plan**: B1F is completely unmapped. We will walk every walkable corridor on B1F, logging coordinates of all walls, items, and gates.
- **Circuit Matrix Logging**: We will record all basement gates and their status under State A and State B in `Scratchpad/Mansion_Gate_Matrix`.
- **Statue 4 Evaluation**: If we discover a fourth Mewtwo Statue (Statue 4), we will stand adjacent, face it, and interact with 'A' to toggle it. We will then systematically map which gates in B1F open/close, logging the exact turn and proof of work in our matrix.

## Strategic Notes from Overwatch Audit (Turn 80167)
- **1F West Switch Statue 1 Plan**: If we need to find and toggle Statue 1 on 1F West in the future, we must explore the westernmost room (Columns 1-4, typically around (2, 5)), as the statue at (10, 8) has been proven decorative.

## Socratic Strategy & Coordinate Verification (Turn 80913 Audit) - Verified & Updated
- **Analysis of Southeast Room Rows**:
  - The Southeast room is documented to span Rows 9-15 on 2F East (Map 0_214).
  - Physical testing on Turn 76552-76760 has proven that the Southeast room is 100% isolated and cannot be reached on foot on 2F under both State A and State B because Column 22 is completely blocked by solid rubble/walls on Rows 8-15.
  - Socratic Question 1 is fully resolved: the 2F Southeast room is completely unreachable on foot.
- **Definitive 3F Crossover Passability Audit (Updated Turn 81543)**:
  - We have previously concluded that 3F West is completely blocked from 3F East under both State A and State B.
  - However, our previous testing under State B (Turn 81045) was flawed because we stood on a solid wall tile (8, 12) and tried to walk Right onto (9, 12), resulting in a bump. In Gen 1, attempting to walk from an already solid tile always results in a collision.
  - On Turn 81534, we tested walking Down from the open tile (9, 11) onto (9, 12) under State B (Statue 2 Toggled). Result: **Bump**, remaining at (9, 11). This empirically proves that (9, 12) is indeed 100% solid and impassable under State B.
  - On Turn 81538, we tested walking Right from the open tile (9, 11) onto (10, 11) under State B (Statue 2 Toggled). Result: **Bump**, remaining at (9, 11). This empirically proves that (10, 11) is indeed 100% solid and impassable under State B.
  - Since Column 10 is completely solid rubble/walls on Rows 8-15, and Row 12 Column 9 is solid rubble/wall under State B, the 3F West-East crossover is 100% physically blocked and impassable on foot under BOTH State A and State B. There is no walkthrough connection on 3F.
