# Post-Safari Zone Route & Progression Plan (Cinnabar Mansion)

## Cinnabar Mansion Deep B1F Routing & Switch Matrix (Turn 78160)
- **State A (Statue 2 Default)**:
  - Gate 1 on 1F (25, 13) is CLOSED, blocking foot access to the Southeast room.
  - Gate 3 on 2F (18, 8)-(19, 8) is OPEN (Verified OPEN on Turn 78836).
  - Gate 4 on 1F East (21, 17) is OPEN.
  - Gate 6 on 2F (9, 4)-(9, 5) is CLOSED.
  - Gate 18 on 2F (2, 18) is CLOSED.
  - Gate 26 on 2F (12, 26)-(13, 26) is CLOSED.
  - Gate 13 on 2F (12, 13)-(13, 13) is CLOSED.

- **State B (Statue 2 Toggled)**:
  - Gate 1 on 1F (25, 13) is OPEN, allowing foot access to the Southeast room.
  - Gate 3 on 2F (18, 8)-(19, 8) is CLOSED (Verified CLOSED on Turn 84976).
  - Gate 4 on 1F East (21, 17) is CLOSED.
  - Gate 6 on 2F (9, 4)-(9, 5) is OPEN.
  - Gate 18 on 2F (2, 18) is OPEN (Verified on Turn 86403 by toggling Statue 2 to State B).
  - Gate 26 on 2F (12, 26)-(13, 26) is CLOSED.
  - Gate 13 on 2F (12, 13)-(13, 13) is CLOSED.

## State B 1F East Staircase & B1F Access Model (Active Turn 90244)
- **Objective**: Determine how to access the basement floor (B1F) of Pokémon Mansion.
- **Topological Reality Check**:
  - The eastern shaft is a strictly one-way descending path: 3F East (pit) -> 2F East Southeast (stairs down) -> 1F East Southeast (stairs down) -> B1F (stairs down).
  - Therefore, we cannot climb up the eastern side of the mansion.
  - To reach the start of this descending path on 3F East, we must cross from 3F West via the crossover gate at Column 10 Row 11.
  - Gate 2 on 3F (10, 11) is OPEN under active State B.
  - *Correction / Empirical Proof (Turn 89994/90003)*: We verified that Gate 2 at (10, 11) is CLOSED and solid under active State A AND active State B. Wait, why? The overwatch alert identified that our custom tool `activate_mansion_switch` contained a critical design flaw (pressing UP inside the YES/NO choice box, which shifted the cursor from YES to NO and cancelled the switch activation). Thus, Mewtwo Statue 2 at (2, 11) was NEVER successfully toggled to State B! We have been in active State A (Default) this whole time, which is why Gate 2 remained closed.
- **Current Action Plan (Updated Turn 90244)**:
  - Climb the stairs at (7, 10) on 2F West to reach 3F West.
  - Walk Left along Row 11 to Column 5 (at (5, 11)).
  - Walk Down Column 5 to Row 15 to reach the southern balcony area at (5, 15).
  - Test walking Right (East) off the balcony edge at (5, 15) onto Column 6 (6, 15) to execute the unblocked western balcony drop under State B!
  - Land in the isolated 2F Southeast room, and navigate to the stairs to B1F.
## State B 2F East South Balcony Railings Campaign (Active Turn 89522)
- **Objective**: Systematically and physically test the passability of the 2F East South balcony boundaries (Columns 11-14, Rows 15-26) on foot under active State B to find any potential jump-down drop or passage. This campaign is successfully completed.
- **Conclusive Proof of Isolation**: Every single coordinate has been tested on foot and found 100% solid. No drops, gaps, or passages exist on the 2F East South balcony under State B.

## Turn 90305 Execution & B1F Descent Plan
- **Current Position**: standing at (2, 12) on 2F West. Mewtwo Statue 2 has been successfully toggled to State B!
- **Completed Steps**:
  - Turns 90298-90299: Interacted with Statue 2 and toggled gates to State B.
- **Next Steps**:
  1. Turn 90305: Walk to the stairs at (7, 10) on 2F West and climb to 3F West.
  2. Walk Right to (10, 11) on 3F West and cross Gate 2 (open under State B) to reach 3F East.
  3. On 3F East, walk to the giant pit and fall down to reach B1F stairs.
  4. Collect the Secret Key from B1F!
## 1F West to 1F East Northern Crossing Layout (Verified Turn 90445)
- Column 12 is a completely open, passable vertical walkway (TYPE_3fe2) from Row 12 to Row 7, providing the vertical path to bypass the horizontal partition wall at Row 9 in 1F West.
- Path from (10, 11) to northern crossing:
  - Right 2 to (12, 11)
  - Up 4 to (12, 7)
- **Turn 90465**: Reached (26, 3) on 1F East. Column 22 wall partition has been successfully bypassed via Row 3! Now making our way down Column 26 to reach Gate 1 at (25, 13).
