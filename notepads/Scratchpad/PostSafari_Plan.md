# Post-Safari Zone Route & Progression Plan (Cinnabar Mansion)

## Cinnabar Mansion Deep B1F Routing & Switch Matrix (Turn 78160)
- **State A (Statue 2 Default)**:
  - Gate 1 on 1F (25, 13) is CLOSED, blocking foot access to the Southeast room.
  - Gate 3 on 2F (18, 8)-(19, 8) is OPEN (Verified OPEN on Turn 78836).
  - Gate 4 on 1F East (21, 17) is OPEN.
  - Gate 6 on 2F (9, 4)-(9, 5) is CLOSED.
  - Gate 18 on 2F (2, 18) is CLOSED.
  - Gate 26 on 2F (12, 26)-(13, 26) is CLOSED.
  - Gate 13 on 2F (12, 13)-(13, 13) is CLOSED.

- **State B (Statue 2 Toggled)**:
  - Gate 1 on 1F (25, 13) is OPEN, allowing foot access to the Southeast room.
  - Gate 3 on 2F (18, 8)-(19, 8) is CLOSED (Verified CLOSED on Turn 84976).
  - Gate 4 on 1F East (21, 17) is CLOSED.
  - Gate 6 on 2F (9, 4)-(9, 5) is OPEN.
  - Gate 18 on 2F (2, 18) is OPEN (Verified on Turn 86403 by toggling Statue 2 to State B).
  - Gate 26 on 2F (12, 26)-(13, 26) is CLOSED.
  - Gate 13 on 2F (12, 13)-(13, 13) is CLOSED.

## State B 1F East Staircase & B1F Access Model (Active Turn 89575)
- **Objective**: Determine how to access the basement floor (B1F) of Pokémon Mansion.
- **Topological Reality Check**:
  - The B1F stairs are located on 1F East at (21, 23).
  - Under active State B, Gate 4 at (21, 17) is CLOSED, completely blocking on-foot access to Column 21 Rows 18-27 from the north.
  - Column 22 is blocked by solid rubble/walls on Rows 14-27, separating Column 21 from Columns 23-28 (the Southeast room) horizontally.
  - Column 11 is blocked by solid walls, separating Column 21 from the west side.
  - Under active State A, Gate 4 is OPEN, but Row 13 on 1F East is completely blocked across all Columns, preventing on-foot access to the southern half.
  - Therefore, the B1F stairs are completely isolated on foot on 1F under both states! They can only be reached by dropping from above (specifically, falling from the 3F East balcony pit).
- **Correct Cinnabar Mansion Progression Model**:
  - **State B is required**:
    1. Gate 1 at (25, 13) on 1F East is OPEN under active State B, allowing foot access to the Southeast room on 1F East (Columns 23-28).
    2. In the 1F East Southeast room, there is a staircase going UP to 2F East Southeast room.
    3. In the 2F East Southeast room, there is a staircase going UP to 3F East.
    4. On 3F East, walk to the rightmost balcony pit. Falling through the right side of this pit drops us past 2F and directly onto 1F next to the B1F stairs!
- **Current Action Plan**:
  - Walk to the 1F East Southeast room (by walking Right past Column 9, through Gate 1 at (25, 13)), and take the staircase UP to 2F East.
  - **Empirical Progress (Turn 89575)**: Currently standing at (12, 6) facing Up. We have navigated successfully around the Column 13 solid wall partition and are poised to cross Row 6 horizontally to 1F East.

## State B 2F East South Balcony Railings Campaign (Active Turn 89522)
- **Objective**: Systematically and physically test the passability of the 2F East South balcony boundaries (Columns 11-14, Rows 15-26) on foot under active State B to find any potential jump-down drop or passage. This campaign is successfully completed.
- **Conclusive Proof of Isolation**: Every single coordinate has been tested on foot and found 100% solid. No drops, gaps, or passages exist on the 2F East South balcony under State B.
