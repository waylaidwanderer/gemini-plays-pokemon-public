- EMPIRICAL FACTS (Victory Road 2F):
  - CRITICAL NAV RULE: GameState provides FEET coordinates (X, Y). The hat visually overlaps (X, Y-1).
  - TILE LEVELS: Dark Red Blocky = Level 1 (Low). DP Speckled = Level 2 (High).
  - 2F West and East appear disconnected. Paths East are blocked by Level 1 Blue Rubble or Level 2 dropoffs.
  - 2F BOULDER PUZZLE SOLUTION (In Progress):
    1. Stand at Feet(4,13). Push boulder Down to (4,15), stepping to (4,14).
    2. Walk to (5,15). Push boulder Left to (3,15).
    3. Walk to (3,14). Push boulder Down to (3,16).
    4. Walk to (4,16). Push boulder Left to (1,16) onto the switch.
- STRATEGY UPDATE (SOLVED PUZZLE LOGIC):
  - The only connection between 2F East and West is the Level 2 overpass, crossing the X=8 boundary at Y=9. We verified this path exists!
  - To reach 2F West from 2F East Level 1: Navigate to stairs at (21,15) to reach Level 2 at (21,14). Walk Left to (15,14), Up to (15,8), Left to (5,8), Down stairs to (5,11) [Level 1 West].
  - From (5,11) Level 1 West: Walk to (3,8), which was opened by the 2F boulder puzzle. Walk Left to the (0,8) ladder down to 1F (1,1). From 1F (1,1), find the 3F ladder.
- EMPIRICAL BOUNDARIES & LAYOUT (VERIFIED):
  - The Level 2 bridge at Y=9 successfully allows crossing the X=8 boundary. 
  - The Juggler at (12,9) blocks the path on Level 1, but we can walk OVER his hat on Level 2 at (12,8) to bypass him. 
  - The Level 2 overpass continues East and South, functioning as a wide open area at Y=12/13. It leads to stairs DOWN to Level 1 at (15,15) and (21,15).
- PATH TO 1F LADDER (25,14): From the Level 2 corridor at Y=16, walk to (15,16). Take the stairs at (15,15) to reach Level 1 at (15,14). Walk North to (15,12), then East along the Y=12 corridor to (25,12), and Down to the ladder at (25,14). This bypasses the Juggler at (21,13) and the dead end at (21,14).
- PATH TO 3F LADDER (23,7): From (21,16), walk East to (28,16), North to (28,11), West to (22,11), North to (22,7), East to (23,7).
