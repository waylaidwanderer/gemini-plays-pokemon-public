## Plan: Reach Suicune at (14, 10) (Started Turn 49086)
- Goal: Complete Suicune sighting in Cianwood.
- Step 1: Use Super Repel and reach (23, 32). <- CURRENT TASK
- Step 2: Surf at (23, 32) and land at (24, 34).
- Step 3: Reach southern highway at (24, 51).
- Step 4: Reach western beach at (2, 35) via Row 51 and Row 35 gaps.
- Step 5: Walk North along West Beach (X=2) to Row 10.
- Step 6: Walk East along Row 10 to (14, 10).

## Highway Definitions (Verified)
- X=24: Vertical land path (Row 34 to 52).
- Row 51: Horizontal land path (X=4 to 24).
- X=4: Vertical land path (Row 35 to 51).
- X=2: Vertical land path (Row 10 to 35).
- Row 10: Horizontal land path (X=2 to 14).

## Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Requires Surf.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable cliff face.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
- BUOY: Impassable.

## Navigation Notes
- (10, 40) is a WALL (Gym building), blocking the X=10 corridor south of Row 39.
- (20, 34) is a Sign (WALL), bypass via Row 35.

## Battle Strategy: Eusine

## Technical Status
- Python Sandbox: Reporting 'not running' errors. Tools offline.
- Super Repel: Wore off Turn 49089. Re-applying.
