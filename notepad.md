# Suicune Quest Log (Crystal Version)
- Prerequisites: Clear Bell (Obtained).
- Quest Start: Turn 24182 (Timestamp: Saturday, Dec 27, 2025, 9:35 AM PST).
- Loop Start: Turn 26164 (Stuck on sightings).
## Current Strategy
- Plan:
  1. Walk to (26, 15) to trigger the Suicune sighting on Route 42.
  2. If no trigger, check the Burned Tower basement for Eusine.
  3. If progress stalls, head to Route 36 junction (35, 9).
  4. If all overworld sightings fail, attempt to enter Tin Tower.

## Lessons Learned
- Suicune events are strictly linear.

- Verification is key: Marker at (11, 20) in Cianwood confirms Eusine's defeat.
