## I. Game Systems & Mechanics

### Tile Traversal Protocol
- **Testing Mandate:** When a new, reachable tile type is seen, I MUST test it immediately.
- **Movement Test:** Attempt to move *into* and *out of* the tile from all 4 cardinal directions. Document results.
- **Interaction Test:** If movement fails, I must attempt to interact with the tile by facing it and pressing 'A'. Document results.
- **Ledge Test:** For any ledge-like tile, I must attempt to move against the apparent direction of the ledge to confirm if it is a one-way path. Document results.

### Verified Tile Types

*   **One-Way Ledges (Verified):**
    *   `LEDGE_HOP_DOWN`: A one-way ledge that can only be hopped **DOWN**.
    *   `LEDGE_HOP_DOWN/RIGHT`: A one-way ledge that can only be hopped in the specified direction.
    *   `LEDGE_HOP_LEFT`: A one-way ledge that can only be hopped **LEFT**.
    *   `FLOOR_UP_WALL`: A complex one-way ledge. Can move **UP** from `FLOOR` to `FLOOR_UP_WALL`. Can move **DOWN** from `FLOOR_UP_WALL` to `FLOOR` (the jump). Cannot move **DOWN** from `FLOOR` to `FLOOR_UP_WALL`.
*   **Special Requirement (Verified):**
    *   `WATER` (Requires HM03 Surf, must be used from adjacent `FLOOR` tile).
    *   `BREAKABLE_ROCK` (Requires Rock Smash).
*   **Complex Tiles (Verified):**
    *   `WARP_CARPET_DOWN`: Traversable. Activated by pressing 'Down' while standing on the tile to trigger a warp.
    *   `WARP_CARPET_DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT`: Traversable. Activated by pressing the corresponding direction while standing on the tile to trigger a warp.
    *   `WARP_CARPET_LEFT`: Traversable. Activated by pressing 'Left' while standing on the tile to trigger a warp.

### Other Mechanics
*   **Object Impassability:** All Map Objects (NPCs, items, signs, etc.) are impassable.
*   **Haircuts:** Increases a Pokémon's happiness.

## II. Strategic Plans & Hypotheses

### Current Quest: The Secret Medicine
*   **Goal:** Find the special medicine in Cianwood City to cure the sick Ampharos in the Olivine Lighthouse.
*   **Current Location:** I have discovered the Cianwood Pharmacy. My working hypothesis is that the Pharmacist inside will give me the medicine.
*   **Alternative Hypothesis:** The Pharmacist may require me to complete another task first, such as defeating the Cianwood Gym Leader.

### Cianwood Gym Puzzle (SOLVED)
*   **Solution:** The puzzle is a multi-step process that requires resetting the gym's state.
    1.  Enter the gym and walk to the northernmost tile of the eastern path at (8, 6). This causes the boulders blocking the central path to disappear and a new Black Belt to appear at (5, 5), creating what appears to be an impassable state.
    2.  Exit the gym and re-enter. This resets the player's position to the entrance but keeps the boulders gone, clearing the path directly to the Gym Leader.
*   **Trap:** Attempting to walk up the central path after re-entering causes the boulders to reappear, trapping the player. The side paths must be used to reach the Gym Leader.

### Cianwood City NPCs
*   **Pokefan F (11, 46):** Will give a gift (likely HM02 FLY) after defeating the Cianwood Gym Leader.
