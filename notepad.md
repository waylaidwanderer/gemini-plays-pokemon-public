- Wild battles: Prioritize escaping.
- Leads: ALWAYS lead with Calcifer (Lv45) in wild areas. (Swap abandoned).
- Menu Mechanics: To switch lead, use the 'A' button sub-menu "SWITCH" option. Shortcut "Select" is unreliable.
- Verification: Game State warps at (5, 12) and (12, 13) indicate pits are NOT filled.
