# Suicune Quest
- Start Turn: 46650
- Objective: Trigger sighting in Cianwood City at the northern shore.
- Strategy: The Sea-Land Loop (Bypasses all ledges/walls)
    1. Walk East to (19, 30).
    2. Surf East to X=24.
    3. Surf South along X=24 to Y=52.
    4. Land at (23, 52).
    5. Walk West along Row 52 to the far west corridor at X=2.
    6. Walk North along X=2 to Y=4.
    7. Walk East to (7, 4) to trigger the sighting.
- Note: Internal city walls and ledges are impassable. The coastline is the only reliable thoroughfare. Suicune sighting count = 1.

# Roaming Beast Data
- Raikou: Unknown
- Entei: Unknown
- Suicune Sightings: 1 (Ecruteak), 2 (Cianwood - Pending)

# Strategy: Capture all Legendary Pokemon
- Requirements: Clear Bell (Owned), 16 Badges (Owned).
- Plan: Complete sightings -> Tin Tower -> Capture Suicune (Lv 40).

# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard walkable ground.
- WATER: Traversable only while Surfing (requires HM03).
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- WALL: Impassable obstacle.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL / LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: These specific tiles in Cianwood (6, 34), (12, 50), (23, 46) act as IMPASSABLE walls from the north. Do not attempt to jump them.
- Interaction: To Surf, face WATER from an adjacent FLOOR tile and press A. Stepping onto FLOOR from WATER automatically ends Surfing.

# Lessons Learned
- Cianwood's ledges are not standard; manual verification is required. If a jump fails once, do not repeat.
- Zig-zag buoy lines block the eastern sea. Use the far eastern corridor (X=24+) for north-south travel if needed.
- Always reveal 'unseen' tiles manually before planning long routes through them.
