# Ice Path Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Reach Blackthorn City.
- **Status:** Resetting Ice Puzzle to try new path.

  - South Ledges (Row 24) are blocked.
  - West Row 17 is blocked.
  - North-East Loop is a dead end.
- **Plan:**
  1. Escape current area to (13, 16).
  2. Start Puzzle: (13, 17) -> Right to (15, 17).
  3. Slide **UP** from (15, 17) into the unknown.
- **Items:** Item Balls at (32, 23) and (35, 9).

# Key Log
- **Turn 16261:** Surfing on Route 44 (35,9).
- **Turn 16240:** Defeated Psychic Phil.
- **Turn 16222:** Confirmed Suicune not in Pokedex.
- **Route 44 Update:** North/East bank of 2nd lake (Zach's island) is a DEAD END (Ledges block Eastward travel).
- **Correction:** Path to Blackthorn must be via the South Path, accessible from the 1st lake (likely landing South at x=27).
- **Next Step:** Backtrack to 1st lake and explore South bank.
- **Turn 16312:** Defeated Cooltrainer Cybil. Proceeding East on South Path to Blackthorn City.
- **Turn 16322:** Defeated Cooltrainer Allen at (37,15).
- **Turn 16327:** At (44,4). Path blocked by ledges. Looping South to (44,14) then East to (49,14) to use the gap.
- **Turn 16328:** Entered Ice Path 1F at (4,19).
- **Observation:** Spotted an Item Ball at (32, 23) in the eastern ice area, currently separated by a wall.
- **Observation:** Spotted another Item Ball at (35, 9) in the far North-East, currently unreachable from the low ground.
- **Correction:** The "South-East Path" was a dead end.
- **Hypothesis:** The way forward is likely jumping the ledge at (18, 24) to access the southern rows (25+).
- **Turn 16368:** Sliding Down from (19, 21) to (19, 23). Next: Move Right to (20, 23) to exit ice.
- **Turn 16369:** Dismissing Repel text. Retrying Slide Down from (19, 21).
- **Turn 16370:** Retrying Slide Down from (19, 21). Previous attempt interrupted by Repel text.
- **Turn 16374:** Spotted Item Ball at (31, 7). Continuing West along Row 11.
- **Turn 16375:** Reached dead end at (25, 11). Confirmed West path blocked by wall.
- **Correction:** The "North-East Loop" is a dead end on this level.
- **Action:** Backtracking to (20, 23) to retry the ledge jump at (20, 24). This is the only remaining lead to reach the lower-south area and the West Corridor (x=0).
