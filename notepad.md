# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard traversable tile.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable collision.
- WATER: Requires SURF.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way (South). Blocks North.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Terrace. Walk ONTO from climb side to climb. Conclusion: Blocks jumping down from the north (Acts as wall). Allows horizontal movement while elevated.
- BREAKABLE ROCK: Requires ROCK SMASH.
