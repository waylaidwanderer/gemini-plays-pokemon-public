# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Strategy: The Western Highway (X=2)
The northern plateau (14, 10) is accessible via the western coastal highway (X=2). This route utilizes the UP_WALL mechanic to climb "up" the terraces and bypass the ledge system.

### Execution Plan
1. Terrace Entry: Navigate to (6, 47) via the gap at (10, 34). (In Progress)
2. Terrace Ascent: Move North through (6, 46) [UP_WALL] to reach the middle terrace.
3. Western Cross-over: Move North through (4, 20) [UP_WALL] to reach the western highway at X=2.
4. Final Dash: Walk North along X=2 to Row 10 and move East to trigger Suicune.

## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL, BUOY, DOOR: Impassable.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way. Blocks DOWN (South) movement. Allows UP (North) movement. (e.g., (4, 30), (4, 20), (6, 46), (6, 34)).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way. Blocks UP (North) movement. (e.g., (10, 15)).

## Battle Plan: Eusine
- Expected Team: Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25).
- Lead: Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion). Strategy: Flamethrower sweep.

## Verified Obstacles
- Row 50: Elevation traps block southern land access from the center.
- Row 15: Ledge at (10, 15) blocks northern land access from the south.
- (11, 13): Fake tree (solid wall).
