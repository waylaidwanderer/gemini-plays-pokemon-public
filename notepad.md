# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Investigate Team Rocket Hideout (Mahogany Town).
- **Secondary Goal:** Open Locked Doors on B2F.
- **Immediate Task:** Trigger the event to open the doors (likely Rival encounter).
- **Status:** Have passwords ("SLOWPOKETAIL", "RATICATE TAIL"). Door says "Needs password".

## Team Rocket Hideout Status
- **B1F:** Security disabled.
- **B2F:** Lance met. Locked doors at (14,12) & (15,12).
- **B3F:** Passwords obtained. Boss room locked.
- **Objectives:**
    1. Open B2F Locked Doors.
    2. Defeat Executive.
    3. Defeat Boss.

## Tile Mechanics
- COUNTER: Impassable.
- **Observation:** Locked doors on B2F at (14, 12) and (15, 12) say "Closed" and "Needs password" respectively. Interaction failed despite having passwords.
- **Hypothesis:** Missing a trigger. Maybe exploration of West B2F or B1F is required. Or Lance is elsewhere.
- **Action:** Moving to West B2F Ladder (3, 14).
- **Exploration:** Returned to B1F via West Ladder (3, 14).
- **Hypothesis:** A Warp Panel on B1F might lead to a restricted area or trigger the next event. Checking Warp Panel at (5, 15).
- **Observation:** B1F is fully connected (East/West joined by gap at 9,4).
- **Status:** Passwords obtained ("SLOWPOKETAIL", "RATICATE TAIL"). B2F Door locked ("Needs password").
- **Blocker:** B2F Door likely requires a different password.
- **Findings:** Bookshelves at (4,13), (6,13), (7,13) contain "Rocket Oath".
- **Immediate Plan:** Retrieve item at (1,12). Then interact with Grunt at (5,14) to check if he moves. If not, return to B1F to check Warp Panel at (5,15).
- TRAP TILES: The floor tiles in the corridors of B1F trigger inescapable battles (Koffing, Geodude, Voltorb). Must fight.
