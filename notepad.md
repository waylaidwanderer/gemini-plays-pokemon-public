# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Cross the whirlpool to reach the Dragon Shrine.

# Key Mechanics & Lessons
- **Field Moves:** If 'A' interaction fails (even when facing correctly), ALWAYS fallback to Menu -> Pokemon -> [Mon] -> [Move].
- **Whirlpool:** Requires facing the whirlpool tile directly. 'A' button might be unreliable; Menu is safer.

- Status: Selecting Whirlpool for Lapis.
- Reason: Party Menu open, cursor on Lapis. Facing DOWN towards whirlpool at (15, 23).
- Step 1: Select Lapis (A).
- Step 2: Scroll down to Whirlpool (Down).
- Step 3: Select Whirlpool (A).
