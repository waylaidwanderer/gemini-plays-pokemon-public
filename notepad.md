# Johto Elite Four Challenge
- Challenge Start: Turn 37260. [Friday 11:58 AM]

## Strategy for Lance (Champion)
- Gyarados: DEFEATED
- Aerodactyl: DEFEATED
- Dragonite #1: DEFEATED
- Dragonite #2: DEFEATED
- Dragonite #3 (Dragon/Flying): ACTIVE. Locked in Outrage (Turn 1 just hit GNEISS). Strategy: Send in XENON to absorb Turn 2 of Outrage, then finish with Calcifer's Thunderpunch.

## Persistence Knowledge
### Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- LADDER: Traversable.
- WARP_CARPET: Walking off map edge triggers transition.

### Lessons Learned
- Gengar (Ghost): Immune to Normal moves (Return).
- Dragonite/Charizard (Ghost interaction): XENON is immune to Normal moves (Hyper Beam/Slash).
- Party Sub-menu Order (Battle): SWITCH, STATS, CANCEL.
- Party Sub-menu Order (Overworld): STATS, SWITCH, ITEM, CANCEL.
- HM Sub-menu logic: HM moves appear at top. SWITCH is 3rd if 1 HM known.
- Status Management: Level advantage is negated by paralysis (75% speed reduction). Priority is clearing status for the speed tier.

## Battle Strategy
- Use fodder/safe turns to Revive key members (Calcifer, XENON, GNEISS).
- Strategy Update: GNEISS fainted to Outrage. XENON is being sent in to tank the next Outrage turn.
- Goal: Finish the battle with Calcifer after XENON absorbs the Outrage pressure.
