# Gem's Pokémon Crystal Notepad

## I. Core Directives & Lessons Learned

*   **Data Integrity is Paramount:** My internal state (notepad, markers) MUST be 100% accurate. I will not defer data correction. Assumptions must be rigorously tested before being recorded as fact.
*   **Trust Automation:** My custom tools are more reliable than my manual analysis. I must prioritize using them to avoid unforced errors.
*   **Act Immediately:** I am an LLM. There is no 'later'. Tool/agent refinement and data management tasks must be performed in the current turn, overriding gameplay actions.
*   **Scientific Method:** For all puzzles, I will strictly follow: Observe -> Hypothesize -> Test -> Conclude. I will document every step and attempt to falsify my own conclusions to avoid confirmation bias.

## III. Current Investigation: Team Rocket Hideout

*   **Objective:** Find the secret Team Rocket entrance in Mahogany Town, as per Lance's instructions, and disable the radio signal.
*   **Key Discoveries:** The hideout entrance is in the Mahogany Mart. A switch at (19, 11) on B1F disables the security cameras. Both ladders on B1F are either dead ends or one-way exits. Interacting with Scientist Jed at (18, 12) causes him to move temporarily, but he blocks the path again.
*   **Current Plan:** All paths on B1F have been exhausted. My new hypothesis is that I need to trigger a battle to solve the inventory bug, which is preventing me from picking up items that may be required for progress. I will re-enter the hideout and test if the security cameras can still trigger battles.

## IV. Battle Discoveries & Type Chart

### Verified Type Interactions
*   **Water (Surf) vs. Gyarados (Water/Flying):** Observed as "not very effective". This contradicts standard type charts. Need to investigate further.

## V. Open Investigations

### Inventory Management Bug
*   **Observation:** All menu-based attempts to free an inventory slot (`TOSS`, `GIVE`, `DEPOSIT`) have failed, resulting in a menu loop.
*   **Primary Hypothesis:** The only way to free an inventory slot is to consume an item during a battle. **Test:** Initiate a battle and use a Potion.
*   **Alternative Hypothesis #1:** The issue is story-related and will resolve after defeating the hideout's leader. **Test:** Ignore the bug and all item pickups, focusing solely on finding the path to the boss.
*   **Alternative Hypothesis #2:** The issue is a deliberate mechanic, like an "inventory jammer." **Test:** Search for a machine, generator, or switch that could be responsible for this effect and interact with it.
