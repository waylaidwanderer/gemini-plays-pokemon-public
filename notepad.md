# Completed Missions
- **Radio Tower:** Defeated Team Rocket, rescued Director, got Clear Bell (for Tin Tower).

# Current Objectives
- **Location:** Ecruteak City (Pokemon Center).
- **Primary:** Prepare for Suicune Rematch (Catch, don't kill).
- **Immediate:** Heal Party -> Restock Balls -> Re-organize Team.

# Suicune Analysis (The Target)
- **Level:** 40
- **Moves:** Bubblebeam (Water), Gust (Flying, Phys), Leer, Rain Dance.
- **Stats:** High Def/Sp.Def. Fast.
- **Catch Strategy:**
    1.  **Status:** MUST HAVE Sleep (Hypnosis/Sleep Powder) or Paralysis. (Lapis has Hypnosis but is Lv 12).
    2.  **HP:** False Swipe (if available) or careful chipping.
    3.  **Balls:** Great Balls (Stock 3 -> Buy 20+).
    4.  **Tank:** Muscle (Machoke) is good but takes heavy damage from Gust due to low Sp.Def/Def drops? Wait, Gust is Physical in Gen 2. Machoke has decent Def. The Def drops from Leer were the killer. X Defend could counter this.

# Team & Resources
- **Money:** ¥12952 (Enough for ~20 Great Balls).
- **Key Assets:**
    - Muscle (Lv 57 Machoke): Main tank/damage.
    - Lapis (Lv 12 Poliwag): Knows Hypnosis. *Needs Training*.
    - Belladonna (Lv 5 Oddish): Useless fodder currently.
    - Garnet (Lv 28 Quilava): Decent speed, resistant to Gust (?). No, Fire doesn't resist Flying.
- **Potential Assets (Box):**
    - Rocky (Onix Lv 21): High Def, Rock resists Flying (Gust). Weak to Water (Bubblebeam). Bad match.
    - Magnemite? (Don't have one).
    - Gastly/Haunter? (Hypnosis user). Do I have one? Check Box. (Lucid is Drowzee Lv 13 with Hypnosis).
