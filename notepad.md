# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) in Cianwood City to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The West Beach Land Route (Verified)
- Plan:
  1. Close SURF menu at (27, 44). [IN PROGRESS]
  2. Walk to (2, 37) via Row 38 and Row 37 gap at X=5.
  3. Walk North along West Beach (X=2) to (2, 14).
  4. Walk East to (8, 14), then North to (8, 12).
  5. Walk East along Row 12 to (14, 12), then North to (14, 10).
- Status: At (27, 44) on land. Repel active.
- Reasoning: The city is a maze of vertical walls. Row 38 and Row 37 provide a horizontal corridor from the east side to the West Beach (X=2). X=2 is a clear vertical highway that bypasses the Row 15 wall/ledge barrier. Row 12/14 provide horizontal access to the plateau.

# Blocked Routes (Verified)
- Central City: Vertical walls at X=5, X=9, X=11, X=17.
- Row 15 Barrier: Solid wall/ledge from X=3 to X=17.
- Row 30/34/46 Barriers: Impassable cliffs (FLOOR_UP_WALL).
- Route 41 Loop: Blocked by East-facing ledge at X=15.

# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard ground. Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Surf required. Traversable.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable cliff face.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
