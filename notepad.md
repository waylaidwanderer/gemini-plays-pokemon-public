# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement. Passable from SOUTH to NORTH. Found at (4, 20), (16, 10), (8, 34), (6, 46), (8, 48), (9, 48), (10, 48), (12, 50).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at (10, 15).
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- Start Turn: 49771
- Start Time: 3:29 PM

## Strategy: The Western Corridor Bypass
1. Surf North to (12, 26). (In Progress)
2. Surf West to (11, 26) to land.
3. Walk West through the (5, 26) gap to (4, 26).
4. Walk North to (4, 22).
5. Walk West through the (3, 22) gap to (2, 22).
6. Walk North through the Western Corridor (X=0-2) to (2, 14).
7. Walk East to (8, 14), then North to (8, 12).
8. Walk East to (14, 12), then North to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

## Hypotheses
- H1: The Western Corridor (X=0-2) is a continuous path from Row 26 to Row 14. (Partially verified by Mental Map).
- H2: (14, 10) is the trigger point for the Suicune sighting. (Marked in Mental Map).
- H3: Row 12 is walkable from X=8 to X=14.

# Progress Notes
- Reached (12, 27) on Turn 49787.
- Note: SUPER REPEL is active (confirmed by overwatch).
- Note: No wild encounters on land in city.
- Failed Strategy: Southern Loop - Too many ledges and dead ends.
- Failed Strategy: X=5 Gap at Row 35 - Unreachable from the North due to FLOOR_UP_WALL at Row 34.
