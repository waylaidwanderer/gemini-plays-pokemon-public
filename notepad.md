# Plan
1.  **Battle Karen:**
    - **Note:** "Zombie Mode" active (0 Potions). Rely on Revives (restores 50% HP) if Muscle faints.
    - **Umbreon:** Muscle (Cross Chop/Strength).
    - **Vileplume:** Muscle (Strength) or Garnet (Ember). Watch for Powders.
    - **Gengar:** Muscle (Dig). *Note: No Levitate in Gen 2, Ground hits Ghost/Poison.*
    - **Murkrow:** Muscle (Strength). Weak Defense.
    - **Houndoom:** Muscle (Cross Chop/Dig) or Gyarados (Surf).
2.  **Champion Lance:**
    - Ice moves needed (Gyarados has none, Muscle has none).
    - Rely on Muscle (Strength/Cross Chop) and Gyarados (Surf/Thrash).
    - Zenith (Dratini) has DragonBreath/Twister? No, Zenith is Lv15.

# Battle Log
- **Vs Bruno:** Victory.
- **Vs Karen:**
  - T1: Muscle OHKO Umbreon (Cross Chop).
  - T2-3: Muscle 2HKO Vileplume (Strength). Muscle Paralyzed.
  - T4: Muscle vs Gengar. Gengar used Curse. Muscle used Dig.
  - T5: Muscle fainted from Curse. Mistral sent in.
  - T6 (Current): Mistral is fodder. Reviving Muscle.
- **Correction:** Previous turn inputs truncated. Now selecting Revive.
- **Action:** Press A to open Party Menu. Will select Muscle next turn to ensure cursor placement.
- **Turn 19324:** Pressed A to select 'USE'. Party menu opening. Target: Muscle (Slot 1). Only valid target for Revive.
- **Turn 19325:** Moving cursor from Mistral (Slot 6) to Muscle (Slot 1).
- **Next:** Confirm Revive on Muscle. Then wait for Mistral to faint.
- **Turn 19326:** Used Revive on Muscle. Muscle restored to 105/211 HP (50%).
- **Next:** Exit menus, let Mistral faint, switch Muscle in.
- **Turn 19329:** Switching Muscle in.
- **Plan:** Muscle (105/211 HP) enters. Gengar will move (Destiny Bond likely fails or ends). Next turn: Dig.
- **Turn 19330:** Retry switching Muscle in using slow_press (A, A). Previous attempt likely failed due to input speed.
- **Strategy:** Dig (Slot 2) once Muscle is in. Dig avoids Destiny Bond from faster Gengar.
- **Turn 19335:** Declining switch. Muscle stays in vs Murkrow.
- **Mistral Update:** Forgot Tackle, learned Quick Attack.
- **Strategy:** Strength (Slot 1) vs Murkrow. Expecting OHKO.
- **Turn 19336:** Dig failed (Flying immune). Murkrow used Faint Attack (12 dmg).
- **Turn 19337:** Using Strength (Slot 1).
- **Reasoning:** Fighting moves are Neutral vs Dark/Flying. Dig is Immune. Strength is reliable neutral damage.
- **Matchup:** Muscle (87/211 HP) vs Murkrow. Muscle is safe.
