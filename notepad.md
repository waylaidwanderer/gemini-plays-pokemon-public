# Strategy: Trigger Suicune Sighting (Started: Turn 51131, Turn 51342 - Refined Plan)
- City Logic: Vertical walls partition the city. Row 13 and Row 15 are major barriers. Gaps exist at (11, 15), (8, 13), and (13, 13).
- The Center Shortcut (Execution Plan):
  1. Walk North to (12, 28).
  2. Use SURF at (12, 28) to cross the Row 20 water; land at (12, 19).
  3. Walk North to (12, 16), then West to (11, 16).
  4. Walk North to (11, 14), then West to (8, 14).
  5. Walk North through the gap at (8, 13) to (8, 12).
  6. Walk East to (14, 12), then North to (14, 10) for the Suicune sighting.
- Battle Prep: Lead Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion).
