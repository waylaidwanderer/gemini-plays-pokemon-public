# Progress Notes
- Reached (18, 48) on Turn 49776.
- Note: Out of Repels. No wild encounters on land in city.
- Hypothesis: Western Corridor (X=0-2) is a continuous path from Row 35 to Row 14. (Partially verified by Mental Map).
- Hypothesis: (14, 10) is the trigger point for the Suicune sighting. (Marked in Mental Map).
