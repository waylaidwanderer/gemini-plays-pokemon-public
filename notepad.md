# Operation: Elemental Upgrade
- **Status:** Indigo Plateau (Will's Room).
- **Plan:** Challenge Elite Four Will.
- **Opponent:** Will (Psychic Type).
- **Strategy:** Use Sneasel (Shadow Ball) and Muscle (ThunderPunch/Ice Punch for Flying/Birds). Gyarados can bite.
- **Next:** Approach Will at (5, 7) and talk.

# Team Status
- Muscle (Lv65): Cross Chop, Strength, ThunderPunch, Ice Punch.
- Support: Gyarados (Intimidate), Sneasel (Shadow Ball/Priority).

# League Preparation
- **Items:** 14 Lemonades (1120 HP), 7 Revives, 8 Full Heals, 5 Hyper Potions.
- **Strategy:** Muscle carries. Revives for emergencies. Lemonade for post-battle top-ups.
- **Money:** ¥1219 (Low funds, rely on current stock).

# General Notes
- **Mechanics:** Max Revive restores HP but NOT PP.
- **Type Matchups (Gen 2):** Ghost is Physical (Good for Sneasel/Shadow Ball). Dark is Special (Bad for Sneasel).
- **Battle:** Elite Four Will.
- **State:** Muscle (181/218) vs Slowbro (~45% HP, +2 Sp.Def).
- **Matchup:** Slowbro used Amnesia.
- **Plan:** Use Strength (Physical).
- **Reasoning:** Amnesia protects against ThunderPunch. Cross Chop did good damage but is inaccurate. Strength is reliable and Physical.
- **Next:** Xatu #2 is likely last.
