# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
- **Start Turn:** 49885
- **Current Status:** Executing the "Great Southern Loop" via Row 46.

## Active Strategy: The Great Southern Loop
The northern plateau (14, 10) is accessible via the western coastal highway (X=2). This path bypasses central walls by looping through Row 46 and Row 51.

### Execution Plan
1. Central Descent: Walk west to (12, 32), then south to (12, 46). (In Progress)
2. Westward Crossing: Walk west along Row 46 to (4, 46) (bypass (6, 46) UP_WALL).
3. Southern Clearway: Walk south to (4, 51), then west to (2, 51).
4. Coastal Ascent: Walk north along X=2 to Row 14.
5. Final Approach: Walk east along Row 14 to (6, 14), then north to Row 12, then east to (14, 10).

## Verified Mechanics
- Row 46: Clear westward crossing from X=12 to X=4. (6, 46) is UP_WALL but allows horizontal movement.
- X=4 Corridor: Clear north-south path from Row 34 to Row 50.
- Row 51: Completely clear land bridge across the bottom.

## Battle Plan: Eusine
- Expected Team: Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25).
- Lead: Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion).
- Strategy: Flamethrower sweep. Overleveled status ensures OHKOs.

## Failed Hypotheses
- Hypothesis 1: Land access via X=11 (blocked by Row 30 wall).
- Hypothesis 2: Land access via X=6 (blocked by Row 34 elevation trap).
- Hypothesis 3: Cut tree at (11, 13) (fake tree).
- Hypothesis 4: Direct Surf to beach (dead end).

## Map Markers (Verified ROCKs)
- (4, 19), (4, 25), (10, 27), (5, 29), (8, 16), (9, 17): ROCK objects.
- (14, 10): Suicune sighting point.
