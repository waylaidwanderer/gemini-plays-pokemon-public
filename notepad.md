# I. Game Mechanics & Traversal
## A. Core Rules
- **Level Cap:** 8 badges = Level 65.
- **"No Will to Fight" Message:** A party menu cursor error on a fainted Pokémon, not a refusal to battle.
- **HM Usage:** HMs are used from the party menu. Fainted Pokémon can use field moves.
- **PC Interaction:** Stand directly below the PC, face up, and press 'A'.
- **Surfing:** Not all `ground` tiles adjacent to `water` are valid starting points.
- **Puzzle Resets:** Leaving and re-entering a floor resets all boulders to their original positions.
- **Data Trust:** The map XML data is the ultimate source of truth for traversal.
## B. Tile Glossary & Movement Rules
- `ground`: Standard walkable tile.
- `grass`: Wild Pokémon encounters.
- `water`: Requires SURF.
- `impassable`: Wall.
- `ledge`: One-way traversal. Can only be jumped DOWN from the tile directly above. Acts as a wall from all other directions.
- `elevated_ground`: Walkable, different elevation. It is NOT possible to step down from an `elevated_ground` tile to an adjacent `ground` tile unless using a `steps` tile.
- `steps`: Allows movement between `ground` and `elevated_ground` in both directions.
- `boulder_switch`: Floor switch for boulders.
- `boulder_barrier`: Impassable barrier linked to a boulder switch.
- `cleared_boulder_barrier`: A former barrier, now acts as `ground`.
- `hole`: Drops to a lower floor. Pushing a boulder into one causes it to appear on the floor below.
- `spinner`: Forces movement.
- `ladder_up` / `ladder_down`: Warps between floors.
- `cuttable`: A tree that can be removed with the HM Cut.
- **Defeated Trainers (Hypothesis):** Some defeated trainers may be impassable obstacles. The Juggler at (22, 14) on Victory Road 2F was confirmed to be impassable. However, this may not apply to all defeated trainers. Further testing is required.

# II. Battle Intel
## A. Type Effectiveness Chart (Verified)
- **Super Effective (2x):** Psychic > Ghost, Poison; Ghost > Psychic; Electric > Rock, Water; Flying > Grass, Poison, Fighting; Ice > Ground, Grass, Flying, Dragon; Ground > Poison, Fire, Electric, Rock, Ground; Rock > Fire, Ice, Flying, Bug; Fighting > Normal, Rock, Ice; Water > Fire, Ground, Rock; Grass > Water, Ground, Rock; Bug > Grass, Poison, Psychic; Poison > Grass, Bug
- **Not Very Effective (0.5x):** Normal !> Rock; Electric !> Grass, Electric, Dragon; Rock !> Psychic; Psychic !> Psychic; Poison !> Poison, Ground, Rock, Ghost; Ice !> Water, Ice, Fire; Fighting > Poison, Flying, Psychic, Bug; Water !> Water, Grass, Dragon; Grass !> Fire, Grass, Poison, Flying, Bug, Dragon
- **Immune (0x):** Flying immune to Ground; Ground immune to Electric; Ghost immune to Normal, Fighting
- **Correction:** Psychic-type moves deal NEUTRAL (1x) damage to Rock-type Pokémon.

# III. Tool Development & Debugging
- **`gem_pathfinder_v2` Status:** The tool is currently bugged and cannot reliably navigate Victory Road 2F. It fails to find valid paths that exist on the map.
- **`puzzle_strategist_agent` Status:** The agent has proven reliable, correctly identifying an unsolvable puzzle on Victory Road 1F. It has been updated to provide step-by-step solutions for solvable puzzles.
- **Debugging Principle:** Trust direct, in-game evidence over personal assumptions. When a tool fails after being corrected, re-evaluate the map data and my own understanding to find the true obstacle and form a new plan.
- **Lesson on Confirmation Bias:** I must be wary of confirmation bias. I previously wasted time assuming a path was blocked because my tools were flawed and my understanding of game mechanics was incorrect. I must actively try to disprove my own assumptions and be more willing to change my strategy when my tools contradict my beliefs.

# IV. Current Plans
## A. Victory Road 2F Progression
- **Status:** The western boulder puzzle is solved, which should clear the barrier at (24, 15).
- **Next Step:** The barrier's state has not updated because it is off-screen. I must navigate to a position where the barrier is visible (e.g., near (22, 17)) to force a map data update. After that, the path to the ladder at (24, 8) should be clear.
