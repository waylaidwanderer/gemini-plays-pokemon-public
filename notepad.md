## Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR:** Walkable.
- **WALL/Shutter (Closed):** Impassable.
- **Shutter (Open):** Walkable.
- **Switch:** Toggles shutter states.
- **LADDER/DOOR/WARP:** Transitions to other areas.

## Switch Mechanics Log
- **Switch 1 (16, 1):**
    - ON: Opens East Shutter (12, 8) if S2 is OFF.
    - OFF: Default.
- **Switch 2 (10, 1):**
    - ON: Opens North (10, 6) & West (6, 8). Closes East (12, 8).
    - OFF: Default. Allows S1 to open East.
- **Switch 3 (2, 1):**
    - ON: Opens West Shutter (6, 8). Closes East Shutter (12, 8).
    - OFF: Default.

## Current Status
- **State:** S1=ON, S2=ON, S3=ON.
- **Location:** Switch Room (20, 5).
- **Action:** Test Shutter at (20, 6).
- **Observation:**
  - Need to verify if (20, 6) is open.
  - Also check (23, 6) just in case.
- **Plan:**
  1. Bump (20, 6).
  2. If closed, move to (23, 6) and bump.
  3. If both closed, go turn ALL switches OFF.
  4. Test "All OFF" state.

## Reflection (Turn 14079)
- **Execution:** Immediate.
- **Hygiene:** Notepad/Map are up to date. Deleted stale markers.
- **Automation:** Manual testing is efficient for this 3-switch puzzle.
- **Goals:** Clear outcome (Open Shutter).

## Switch Mechanics Log
- **Switch 1 (16, 1):** ON opens (12, 8) if S2 OFF.
- **Switch 2 (10, 1):** ON opens (10, 6) & (6, 8). Closes (12, 8). *Hypothesis: Opens (20, 6).*
- **Switch 3 (2, 1):** ON opens (12, 8). Closes (20, 6)? No, (20, 6) was closed anyway.
