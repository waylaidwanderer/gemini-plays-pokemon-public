# Suicune Quest
- Objective: Trigger sighting in Cianwood City at the northern shore.
- Primary Strategy: The Great Northern Sea Loop (Corrected)
    1. Surf at (19, 30) and head East to (23, 30).
    2. Surf North along X=23 to Row 8 (bypasses buoy walls at Y=9 and Y=15).
    3. Surf West along Row 8 to (19, 8), then South to (19, 11).
    4. Surf West to land at (16, 11).
    5. Walk West along Row 12 to X=2, then North to (7, 4).
- Note: Buoy walls at Y=9 and Y=15 are solid between X=16 and X=22. X=23 is a clear north-south channel.
- Note: Land routes are blocked by internal walls and impassable ledges (verified at (6, 34), (12, 50), (23, 46)). The sea loop is the only confirmed path.
- Suicune sighting count = 1.

# Tile Mechanics (Cianwood)
- FLOOR: Standard walkable ground.
- WATER: Traversable only while Surfing.
- WALL / FLOOR_UP_WALL / LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: All act as IMPASSABLE obstacles from the north.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- Interaction: Surf from FLOOR adjacent to WATER by pressing A.

# Confirmed Sea Gaps
- X=27: Clear north-south channel from Row 30 to Row 0.
- Row 10: Clear east-west channel from X=27 to X=23.
- Row 8: Clear east-west channel from X=23 to X=19.

# Lessons Learned
- Cianwood ledges are traps; do not attempt to jump them from the north.
- Internal walls divide the city into vertical strips; use the sea loop to bypass them.
- Always verify path traversability before committing to long sequences.
