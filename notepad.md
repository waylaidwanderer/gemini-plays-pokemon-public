# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Reach the Dragon Shrine via the East Whirlpool.

# Current Status (Turn 18291)
- **Location:** Dragon's Den B1F (24, 22).
- **Facing:** Up (Corrected from GameState).
- **Error:** Previous "Can't use that here" was because I was facing Up (Empty Water) instead of Down (Whirlpool).
- **Action:** Reset Menu, Face Down, Interact.
- **Plan:**
  1. Close all menus (`B` x5).
  2. Face Down (`Down`).
  3. Interact with Whirlpool (`A`).
  4. If prompt appears, Confirm (`A`).

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Requires HM06 Whirlpool + Glacier Badge. Usage: Menu -> Pokemon -> Select Mon -> Whirlpool.
- **Lava/Magma:** (None here, but good to remember).
- **Ice:** (None here).

# Lessons
- **Menu Navigation:** Always verify cursor position before committing to a sequence. Blind input leads to wrong menus (e.g., PACK instead of POKEMON).
