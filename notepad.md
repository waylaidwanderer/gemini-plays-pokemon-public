### Reflection (Turn 3218)
- **Progress**: Mapping Route 32 has been slow due to complex walls (`TYPE_fea1`). Identified a likely path via Col 6.
- **Strategy**: The "Bridge Path" (Col 6) bypasses the West Wall (Row 72) and Middle Wall (Row 76).
- **Execution**: Must defeat Fisherman Justin (6, 82) and the second Fisherman (6, 79) to access the crossover at Row 78.
- **Goal**: Reach Row 78 on Col 6, cross West to Col 4, then South to Union Cave.

### Exploration Notes
- **Route 32**: Defeated Camper Roland (3, 43) and Youngster Gordon (4, 60).
- **Union Cave Strategy**:
  - **Layout**: 1F connects Route 32 to Route 33.
  - **Obstacles**: Rock walls and Hikers.
  - **Goal**: Navigate South/West to the exit.

- **Miracle Seed**: Obtained from NPC on Route 32 (Turn 2861).
- **Recent Catch**: Zubat "Jet" (Box 1).
- **Key Items**: Obtained Old Rod from Fishing Guru in Route 32 Pokemon Center.
- **Observation**: `TYPE_a336` at (6, 81) and (8, 81) acts as a bridge railing/blockage. Walkable path is likely Column 7.
- Found **X Attack** at Union Cave (4, 2).
- **Union Cave 1F**:
  - Hiker at (3, 6).
  - Water (`TYPE_4e8c`) blocks South at Row 8.
