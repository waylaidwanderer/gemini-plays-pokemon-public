### Navigation Status: Route 35 Gatehouse
- **Current Location**: Map 11_9 (Route 35 Gatehouse).
- **Goal**: Pass through to Route 35 via door at (5, 0).
- **Obstacle**: Party is full.
- **Plan**: Exit North to Route 35 immediately.

### Validated Routes
- **Flower Shop**: CONFIRMED at Goldenrod City (29, 5).
- **Gatehouse**: Still searching. Likely North on the main road (approx x=13).
- **Underground**: Connects South (11, 29) to North (9, 5). Warning: Confusing layout.

### Ruled Out Routes
- **West Side (Radio Tower)**: Blocked at x=8.
- **Station Front (x=9-13)**: Blocked by Station Building.
- **Direct North (x=8)**: Blocked by Building edge at (8, 13).
- **Flower Shop (19, 1)**: Dead End.

### Navigation Plan
- **Current Location**: (18, 12).
- **Observation**: Successfully crossed tracks at x=18.
- **Action**: Move North past Officer (Row 10), then head West to Name Rater (15, 7) or North to Gatehouse.
- **Goal**: Reach Route 35 Gatehouse.

### Quest Log
- **Badges**: Zephyr, Hive, Plain.
- **Party**: Quilava (27), Sentret (2), Bellsprout (6), Togepi (5), Rattata (8), Igglybuff (5).
- **Storage**: Drowzee (Topaz) [Box 1].
- [9590] CONFIRMED: Goldenrod Underground has side exits to enclosed 'Backyards'. The main City entrances/exits are at (11, 29) [South] and (9, 5) [North].
### Ruled Out Routes
- **West Side (Radio Tower)**: Blocked by NPC.
- **Narrow Path (x=3)**: CONFIRMED DEAD END (y=14). Memory was likely about Underground.
- **North-West (Flower Shop)**: Dead end at (19, 1).
- **Underground**: Exits lead to enclosed areas (9, 5) or back to start.
- **Direct North**: Path to (16, 0) is blocked from (19, 11).
- **Row 10 West**: Blocked by Officer at (18, 10).

### Current Plan
- **Explore North-East**: Move North to Row 10, then East past the Gym.
- **Goal**: Reach the area East of the Gym (x>24) and find the exit to Route 35.
- [9794] Map 11_9 is a RESIDENTIAL HOUSE, not the Gatehouse. Contains Randy (gives Kenya quest).
- **Observation**: At (15, 8), facing Name Rater. Main street is to the West.
- **Plan**: Move West to x=10, then head North to find the Gatehouse.
- **Correction**: Previous "Path North" at x=20 led to dead ends. The true exit is likely aligned with the main vertical road (x~9).
- **Observation**: Building at (9, 5) is the Underground Entrance (North).
- **Observation**: Crossing West at y=16 to reach Main Street.
- **Plan**: Move West to x~8, then Head North to find the Route 35 Gatehouse.
- **Note**: Radio Tower is at (5, 15), so aim for x=8 to avoid blockage.
