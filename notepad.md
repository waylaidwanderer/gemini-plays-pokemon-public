# Gem's Pokémon Crystal Adventure!

## Current Plan & Strategy
- **Current Objective:** Navigate Route 30 to find Mr. Pokémon's house.

## Discoveries & Mechanics
- **Headbutt Trees:** Some trees are 'HEADBUTT_TREE' type, likely for the move Headbutt.
- **Dialogue Triggers:** Some dialogues might loop until another specific NPC in the room is spoken to (e.g., Elm's Lab).

## World Knowledge & NPCs
- **New Bark Town:** A Fisher at (12, 9) mentioned Prof. Elm discovered new Pokémon.

## Lessons Learned
- **Check Notes:** Be diligent about checking my own notes and map markers before exploring to avoid getting lost on already-identified dead ends.
- **Pivot Faster:** If a path is blocked by an unmovable/un-interactive NPC after 1-2 attempts, assume it's a story-based barrier and pivot to exploration instead of repeatedly trying to get past.
- **Running from Battles:** It can be more efficient to run from low-level wild battles if I don't intend to catch them, to save HP and time.

## Unverified Assumptions & Hypotheses
- **Mom's Healing:** Can Mom heal my Pokémon?
- **Ledge Mechanics:** Are ledges in this ROM hack strictly one-way?
- **Youngster Block:** The Youngster at (27, 16) is a temporary obstacle that will move after a future story event is triggered.

## To-Do & Reminders
- **Fix Missing Marker:** Re-create the warp marker at (7, 33) on Route 46 as soon as possible.

- **WKG Data Integrity:** Only record data in the World Knowledge Graph that is directly confirmed from the Game State Information. Do not assume values like `destination_entry_point`.

- **One-Way Paths:** The gatehouse between Route 29 and Route 46 appears to be a one-way path. After exiting into Route 29, the door becomes a wall.
