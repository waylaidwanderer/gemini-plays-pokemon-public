# Strategy: Rising Badge (Gym Leader Clair)
- Tactical Plan: Use Xenon's Night Shade for fixed damage. Gneiss for physical bulk and STAB Earthquake. Calcifer's Thunderpunch for neutral coverage.
- Training Goal: Level Xenon and Kimchi to 30+ to improve move consistency and survivability.

# Strategy: Johto League Training
- Method: Switch-training. Lead with Kimchi or Xenon to share EXP, then switch to Gneiss or Calcifer for the KO.
- Efficiency: Grind in Route 45 grass (4,12)-(5,12).
- Resource Management: Return to Blackthorn PC via FLY when Xenon's Night Shade or Gneiss's Earthquake PP is depleted.

# Battle Strategies & Observations
- Night Shade: Deals fixed damage equal to user level. Essential for grinding and bypassing high Defense.
- Sleep Powder: "It didn't affect" against Ghost-types (like Xenon) usually indicates Normal-type moves failing. Investigating other failure causes (held items, existing status). Not gender-dependent.
- Ghost Typing: Xenon is immune to Fighting and Normal moves (e.g., Quick Attack). Perfect for switching into these attacks.
- Selfdestruct: Major threat from wild Graveler. Gneiss resists; Xenon is immune.

# General Mechanics & Lessons
- Route 45: Ledges divide the route into vertically separated sections. Paths are one-way SOUTH. Use HM02 FLY to return to Blackthorn City.
- Fly Map: Systematic navigation required. Confirm the destination city name in the screen text before pressing A.
- Battle Menus: Use `select_battle_option` for reliable menu navigation. Move menu is Up/Down only.
