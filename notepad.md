# Current Strategy: Ascend Western Waterfall
- **Start Turn:** 26701 (Jan 7, 2026)
- **Location:** Silver Cave Room 2 (3_75)
- **Status:** Moving to (7, 30) to test Left Waterfall.
- **Hypothesis:** x=11 failed. x=6-10 act as currents (push back). I need to interact with a "current" tile from below to climb it.
- **Plan:**
  1. Move to (7, 30).
  2. Face UP.
  3. Use WATERFALL from the Menu (to prevent walking into the current).
  4. If successful, ascend and surf North to Warp (11, 5).
  5. If x=7 fails, test x=8, 9, 10 similarly.

# Key Findings
- **Waterfall Mechanics:**
  - x=11: "Can't use that here".
  - x=6-10: Push player back (Current).
  - Hypothesis: Climbable tile is one of the "current" tiles (likely x=7).
- **History:** Summary claims I climbed at (11, 30) before. This contradicts current observation. I must trust current observation.
