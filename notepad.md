# Strategy: Suicune Hunt (Crystal)
- Sequence: 1. Burned Tower (Done) -> 2. Cianwood (Done) -> 3. Route 42 Island (Current) -> 4. Route 38 -> 5. Route 14 -> 6. Tin Tower 1F.
- Quest Start: Turn 20970 (Dec 25, 5:00 PM)
- Sighting 3 (Route 42): 
    - Verified in Pokedex at Turn 21303 (Dec 25, 6:58 PM).
    - Status: Visited ALL FLOOR tiles on the island. Sprite did NOT appear.
    - Attempted trigger tiles: (24, 14), (25, 14), (26, 14), (27, 14), (25, 15), (26, 15), (27, 15), (28, 15), (29, 15), (30, 15), (26, 16), (30, 16), (26, 17), (27, 17), (28, 17), (29, 17), (30, 17).
    - New Hypothesis: Trigger is on the water or requires re-entering the map.
    - Plan: Re-verify Pokedex (scroll UP from Togepi), then try Surf approach.
- Lessons Learned:
    - Pokedex Navigation: Alphabetical order check! S is before T. Scroll UP from Togepi to find Suicune.
    - Scripted vs Roaming: Suicune is scripted until Sighting 5. Pokedex "AREA" dot for Suicune is reliable during sightings.
    - Menu Stagnation: Avoid repeatedly checking menus for confirmed information. Trust agents and notepad.
