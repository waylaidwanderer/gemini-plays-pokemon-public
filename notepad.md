# Gameplay Notes & Strategy
## Financials
*   Current Money: ¥8922 (as of Turn 10600), ¥8472 (as of Turn 10553)

## Navigation & Exploration
## Battle Strategy
*   Precise battle menu navigation. Mind type matchups & PP. Internalize ROM hack type changes.
*   **Risk Assessment:** Avoid switching low HP Pokémon against KOs. Run if party critical (unless training overrides).
*   **Healing Priority:** Pokémon Center if key Pokémon critically injured & no immediate objective outweighs.
*   **Multi-Pokémon Trainers:** Confirm trainer is fully defeated (all Pokémon) before assuming victory and moving on.
*   **Map Markers:** Mark defeated trainers *immediately* after the battle concludes and dialogue is cleared.

## ROM Hack Specifics
*   **General:** Old Rod (Viridian Mart), HMs forgettable/menu use, TMs repurchasable, Trade evos by level.
*   **Type Matchups (CRITICAL - CONFIRMED/Strong Hypotheses):
    - Ghost (Special) SE vs Psychic (Observed).
    - Poison SE vs Bug (CONFIRMED: BELLA's Acid (Poison) SE vs Lv13 Butterfree (Bug/Flying) on Route 24).
    - Bug NVE vs Poison (CONFIRMED: Beedrill's Pin Missile (Bug) NVE vs ECHO (Poison/Flying) on Route 24).
    - Grass 0.25x vs Poison/Flying (Observed).
    - Poison NVE vs Poison (CONFIRMED: Acid vs Ekans, and likely applies to Zubat which is Poison/Flying).
    - Stun Spore (Grass-type status) failed against Mankey (Fighting) and Ekans (Poison), suggesting type-based immunities to Grass status moves.
    - Electric-type moves (e.g., Thundershock) are NEUTRAL against Poison/Flying types like Zubat.
*   **Stat Boosts:** Pikachu, Farfetch’d, Venomoth, Onix.
*   **Level Caps:** Brock (Onix Lv12 -> Cap 12), Misty (Starmie Lv21 -> Cap 21), Lt. Surge (Raichu Lv28 -> Player Cap 24).

# Game Mechanics & Discoveries
## Battle & EXP Mechanics
*   **EXP at Level Cap:** Pokémon at cap (e.g., BELLA Lv21) gain NO EXP, despite message. BELLA's EXP was 6458 before Psyduck and 6458 after Psyduck, confirming no gain from Psyduck or Starmie.
*   Prioritize healing if party critical (outside of strategic sacrifices).

# Agent Development & Usage
## Evolution Advisor Agent
*   Defined. Will be used for evolution decisions (e.g. Moon Stone on NINA/LUNA).
## General Agent Usage Notes
*   When an agent definition or call fails multiple times, abandon that specific agent or approach for the immediate future and attempt to solve the problem manually or with a different, simpler tool to maintain momentum.
*   The Gym Puzzle Solver Agent was deleted due to repeated failures and hitting the agent limit.
*   `cerulean_pathfinder_agent` (Turn 10508): First use provided a flawed path, attempting to move into the Gym Sign obstacle at (28,22) in Cerulean City. The agent's system prompt was updated (Turn 10751) to better handle basic obstacles. Subsequently, its system prompt and input schema were updated (around Turn 10875) to correctly utilize `game_state_reachable_unseen_tiles_json` for identifying 'Reachable Unseen Tiles' as navigable, overriding the map XML if necessary. It failed to find a path to a 'Reachable Unseen Tile' on Turn 10845 due to not properly overriding the XML, but this should be resolved with the latest update.

# Cerulean Gym Mechanics
*   **Final Conclusion:** All direct water crossings in the central pool are impossible. Path to trainers involves navigating the perimeter ground tiles only. Water tiles marked `navigable: false` are truly impassable. Reaching trainers on platforms requires navigating the outer ground walkways and then specific connecting ground tiles onto those platforms.

# Cerulean Melanies House Notes
*   Melanie (Girl, ID 1) at (4,2) - Non-battling. Dialogue: 'I take care of injured POKéMON. I nursed this BULBASAUR back to health. It needs a good trainer to take care of it now.'
*   Bulbasaur (ID 2) at (5,2) - Non-battling. Dialogue: 'Bubba! Zoar!'. Was not offered despite Melanie's dialogue, possibly due to full party and no PC prompt triggered.
*   This house does not appear to be a direct path to Vermilion City based on initial exploration.
*   Oddish (ID 3) at (2,5) in Melanie's House: Dialogue 'ODDISH: Orddissh!' - Interacted.
*   Sandshrew (ID 4) at (6,4) in Melanie's House: Dialogue 'SANDSHREW: Pikii!' - Interacted.

# Cerulean Bike Shop Notes
*   Bike Shop Clerk at (7,3) offers a BICYCLE for ¥1,000,000.

# Cerulean City Item/Trainer Bug (29,27) & (30,27)
- The Poké Ball item at (29,27) is unobtainable due to Cool Trainer F (ID 7) at (30,27) being in a persistent dialogue loop (e.g., 'ELECTRODE is loafing around...'). Abandoning this item for now. Will try again later if I pass by and remember.

# Exploration Agent Suggestions
* Exploration Prioritizer Agent (Turn 10172): Suggested exploring unseen tile cluster near (31,13) in Cerulean City (Priority 5).

# Tool Usage Discoveries
*   `manage_world_knowledge` `add_node`: Requires a self-generated unique string for the `id` field in the payload, contrary to initial assumption that it was auto-generated if omitted. Example: `{"id": "my_unique_node_id", ...}`.

# Archived Hypotheses & Learnings
## Cerulean City Bridge (Route 24 Exit) - Failed Hypotheses (Archived)
*   Moving North *from* each tile (9,8) through (19,8) does not trigger a map transition.
*   Moving North *onto* each tile (13,8) through (19,8) from their corresponding Y=9 tiles does not trigger a map transition.
*   Stepping *onto* each tile (10,8) through (19,8) by moving eastward along Y=8 does not trigger a map transition.
*   Stepping *onto* each tile (18,8) through (9,8) by moving westward along Y=8 does not trigger a map transition.
*   Moving North from (10,8) when already on the tile and facing North (two-step) does not trigger a map transition. (Tested Turn #9858)
*   Moving North from (11,8) when already on the tile and facing North (two-step) does not trigger a map transition. (Tested Turn #9861)

# Future Agent Ideas
*   (No outstanding unimplemented agent ideas currently)

# Lessons Learned from Critiques & Gameplay
- Resource Management: Protracted battles against single Pokémon (e.g., Pidgey on R24) can severely deplete party resources. Re-evaluate strategy if a battle drags on and consider retreating to heal sooner, especially in a gauntlet.
- Accuracy Debuffs (e.g., Sand-Attack): Stacked accuracy debuffs are extremely detrimental. Consider switching out debuffed Pokémon sooner, even if it means taking a hit on a fresh Pokémon. Moves with <100% base accuracy become highly unreliable.
- Critical Agent Evaluation: While agents provide valuable advice, critically evaluate their recommendations, especially if they rely on unconfirmed assumptions (e.g., speed tiers) or if following their advice repeatedly leads to unfavorable situations (e.g., due to persistent debuffs not fully accounted for by the agent's initial assessment).
- Pathing Near Warps: When pathing near sensitive warps, ensure the movement plan explicitly moves *past* the warp tile if not intending to use it, or detours significantly. Avoid landing on a warp tile if the next intended move is in the warp's activation direction.

# Immediate Tasks
*   Reach Bill's house on Route 25.

*   TM45 (THUNDER WAVE) x1 - Found on Route 24 at (11,6).

*   Received FLAREE (CHARMANDER Lv13) from Cool Trainer M (ID 9, ROUTE24_COOLTRAINER_M4) at (Route 24 7,6). Sent to PC.

## Next Battle Action Advisor Agent Notes
- The `next_battle_action_advisor_agent` can occasionally provide suboptimal or incorrect advice (e.g., suggesting Leech Seed on an already seeded Pokémon on Turn 10866). Always critically evaluate its suggestions, especially in complex or multi-turn scenarios.
- Stun Spore (Grass-type status) failed against Slowpoke (Water/Psychic) on Route 25. This is the third observed failure against a non-Grass type, previously failing against Mankey (Fighting) and Ekans (Poison).

- 'Fully paralyzed' status: Observed Wigglytuff take no damage one turn when 'fully paralyzed' was announced (Turn 10939), but damage was applied on subsequent Thundershock (Turn 10940). This interaction needs more observation. 'Fully paralyzed' prevents movement, not necessarily damage.
