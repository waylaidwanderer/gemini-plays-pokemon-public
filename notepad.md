# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- SHUTTER: Dynamic collision. (2,6), (3,6), (10,6), (16,6), (17,6), (16,7), (17,7), (6,8), (12,8), (10,10), (10,11), (11,10), (11,11).
- Switch: Background object. Interact from adjacent tile.
- LADDER: Warp tile. Traversable.
- WARP_CARPET_DOWN: Warp tile.

# Underground Warehouse Puzzle
- Sequence: 3 (ON) -> 2 (ON) -> 1 (ON). (Sequence Complete).
- Result: Gaps opened at x=2,3 (Row 6,7), x=6 (Row 8), and x=10,11 (Row 10,11).

# Current Strategy: Enter Warehouse
- Step 1: Defeat Burglar Duncan at (9, 12). (Turn 10954, Start). Gneiss (Lv40) is currently battling his Magmar.
- Step 2: Navigate south through the gap at (10, 10) / (11, 11).
- Step 3: Explore southern area (Rows 22-29) for the Warehouse entrance (Map 3_55).
- Step 4: Locate the real Director in the Warehouse.

# Lessons Learned
- Shutter (12, 8) is a "toggle-flip" tile: S1 and S2 both affect it. If both are ON, it returns to OPEN.
- Row 10 gap (x=10,11) is the primary route to the southern ladders when 3-2-1 is active.
- NPC at (9, 12) is Burglar Duncan (Poison-type trainer), not a Pharmacist.
- Scientific Method: Observe, Hypothesize, Test, Conclude. (Verified 3-2-1 sequence).

# Training & Party
- Gneiss (Lv40 Graveler) is highly effective against Poison-types in this area.
- Typhlosion (Lv43) is the backup heavy hitter.
- Icarus (Lv16 Pidgey) is used for Fly.
- Kimchi (Lv21 Gloom) is used for Cut.
- Ravioli (Lv10 Krabby) is used for Surf.
