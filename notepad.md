# Gem's Gameplay Log & Strategies

## 1. Game Mechanics & Lessons Learned
*   **Poison Damage:** Poisoned Pokémon lose 1 HP every four steps outside of battle. This can cause fainting.
*   **Battle Tactics:** Adapt quickly. If a move repeatedly fails (e.g., due to accuracy drops after 2 attempts), switch to a guaranteed-hit move or a different Pokémon. Don't stick to a failing strategy.
*   **WKG Management:** Execute all tool calls from an agent's multi-step plan sequentially and efficiently to avoid errors and save time.

## 2. Current Plan: Mt. Moon
*   **Objective:** Defeat Team Rocket and find the exit to Route 4.
*   **Status:** Currently battling a Team Rocket Grunt on B2F. My party has some members with low HP.
*   **Team Rocket Presence:** Confirmed on 1F and B2F. They seem to be looking for fossils.
