# Tile Mechanics
- **WALL:** Impassable.
- **FLOOR:** Walkable.
- **WARP_CARPET_DOWN:** Exits map (requires entering from North?).
- **LADDER:** Changes floor.

# Objectives & Progress
- **Primary:** Rescue the Director (held in Underground Warehouse).
- **Current Task:** Access the Southeast Underground section to find Switch 2 & 3.
- **Key Item:** BASEMENT KEY (Obtained).

# Puzzle Strategy
- **Goal:** Reach the Northeast section (Ladder to Switches).
- **State:** North Gate (Row 8/9) is CLOSED. South Gate (Row 12) is OPEN (Dead End).
- **Hypothesis:** Walking on Column 9 triggers the gates.
- **Plan:**
    1. Walk UP Column 9 to check if entering from the South toggles the North Gate.
    2. If that fails, Reset the room (go to Elevator) and hug the LEFT wall (Column 8) to avoid the trigger.

# Completed Notes (Archive)
- **Rival Battle:** Defeated Silver (Golbat, Haunter, Feraligatr, Sneasel, Magnemite). Muscle (Machoke) swept.
- **Switch 1:** Found at (16, 1) via Ladder at (22, 27). Turned ON. Did not open the main shutter.
- **Exploration:** Checked Warehouse Room (Map 3_53). North wall shutters are closed. West/Southwest ladders explore.

# Important Locations
- **Switch 1:** Map 3_54 (via 3_53 ladder). ON.
- **Director:** Warehouse (locked behind shutters).
- **Dept Store Basement:** Likely route to switches.
- **Problem:** Rocket Grunt at (16, 23) blocks the path to the East side (Dept Store). He does not battle.
- **Solution:** Use the Underground to bypass the blockade.
- **Plan:**
    1. Re-enter Underground via South Entrance (11, 29).
    2. Traverse Main Tunnel to the **Northwest Ladder** (3, 2).
    3. Enter North Entry Room (3_54).
    4. Force the **North Exit Warp** (21, 29) to trigger (it must work).
    5. This will emerge at Goldenrod City (9, 5) (North side).
    6. Cross East along Row 8 to reach the Dept Store.

# Puzzle Mechanics
- **Shifting Walls:** The boxes in the center room (Cols 10-11, Rows 8-12) toggle between WALL and FLOOR. Likely linked to NPC movement or position. Currently, the South path (Rows 10-12) is OPEN, and the North path (Rows 8-9) is CLOSED.
