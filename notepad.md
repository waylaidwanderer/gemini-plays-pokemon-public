# Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Acts as a South-facing Ledge (verified). Blocks North movement.
- **Warp Carpet:** Located at Row 29/31. Avoid stepping on them unless exiting.
- **Waterfalls:** Found at Row 28/29. Requires HM07 Waterfall.
- **Waterfall Mechanics:** Walking into a waterfall causes a slide-back, setting facing to DOWN. To ascend, ensure facing UP (move away and back if needed) then press A to interact. Requires HM07.
- **Tile Mechanics Update:** `FLOOR_UP_WALL` at Row 4 blocked South movement (failed to jump down). Treating as impassable wall for now.
- **Immediate Task:** Exit Item Room and explore Room 2 Upper Area.
- **Sequence:**
    1. Navigate East to exit warp at (13, 3).
    2. Exit to Silver Cave Room 2.
