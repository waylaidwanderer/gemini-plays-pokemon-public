# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
## Strategy: Northern Sea Landing
Reach the northern plateau (14, 10) by Surfing north in the Outer Sea (X=24) to Row 11, then swimming West across X=18 and X=17 to land at (16, 11). This bypasses all land-based wall/ledge mazes.

## Execution Plan
1. Surf at (23, 32). (Current Turn)
2. Swim North to Row 11 (X=24).
3. Swim West to reach (16, 11) and land.
4. Walk to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune sighting.
