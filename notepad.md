# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH. Allows NORTH.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH. (Row 15).
- BUOY: Water wall. Gaps at (23, 15), (19, 21).

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
## Strategy: Northern Sea Landing
Reach the northern plateau (14, 10) by Surfing north in the Outer Sea (X=24) to Row 21, passing through the buoy gap at (19, 21), and swimming north to land at (16, 11). This bypasses all land-based wall/ledge mazes.

## Execution Plan
1. Surf at (23, 32). (Current Turn)
2. Swim to (19, 21) and pass through the buoy gap.
3. Swim North to Row 11.
4. Swim West and land at (16, 11).
5. Walk to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune sighting.

## Time Tracking
