# Game Mechanics & Rules
- **Dialogue:** A single 'A' press advances dialogue. 'B' can dismiss it.
- **Defeated Trainers:** Some defeated trainers become impassable obstacles.
- **Elevation Rule:** Movement between `ground` and `elevated_ground` is impossible unless a `steps` tile connects them. An exception might exist for adjacent warp tiles.
- **Confusion:** This status effect wears off after a battle ends.

# Battle Notes & Movesets
- Electric is ineffective vs. Ground (Geodude, Sandshrew).
- Grass is 4x effective vs. Rock/Ground (Geodude).
- Electric is NOT very effective vs. Bug/Grass (Paras), or Grass/Poison (Oddish, Bellsprout).

# Area Notes & Navigation
- **Mt. Moon 1F:**
  - The ladder at (26, 16) is a one-way trap to a dead-end area on B1F.
  - The ladder at (6, 6) is a dead end.
  - The ladder at (18, 12) appears to be the main path forward.
- **Mt. Moon B1F:** The ladder at (18, 12) appears to be a one-way path up from B2F.

# Lessons & Future Plans
- My manual navigation is highly inefficient and prone to errors. I must rely on my `pathfinder_agent` for all non-trivial movement.
- The `pathfinder_agent`'s reliability is directly tied to the specificity of its prompt. Future refinements must be extremely detailed.
- Potential Future Agents:
  - `pc_organizer_agent`: To help manage Pok√©mon storage for optimal team building.
  - `fossil_revival_advisor`: To help choose which fossil to revive later.
