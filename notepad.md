# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Verified Strategy: The Buoy Bypass
The northern plateau (14, 10) is only accessible from the western land mass. A detour through Route 41 is required to reach the southern beach (Row 51), which connects to the western ascent. Route 41 has buoy barriers at Row 50-51 that must be bypassed by surfing south to Row 52+.

### Execution Plan
1. Route 41 Transition: Surf east from (27, 45) and exit Cianwood at (29, 45). (In Progress)
2. Buoy Bypass: In Route 41, Surf east to Column 6+, then south to Row 52, then west to Column 0.
3. Southern Re-entry: Re-enter Cianwood City at Row 51.
4. Terrace Ascent: From the southern beach (6, 51), follow the sequence of upward slopes:
   - Climb 1: (6, 46) [UP_WALL]
   - Climb 2: (6, 34) [UP_WALL]
   - Climb 3: (4, 30) [UP_WALL]
   - Climb 4: (4, 20) [UP_WALL]
5. Plateau Entry: Walk to (4, 14) -> (8, 14) -> (8, 12) -> (14, 12) -> (14, 10).
6. Trigger Suicune: Reach (14, 10) to initiate the event.

## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way North.
- WALL: Impassable.
- BUOY: Impassable (Route 41 barriers at Row 50-51).
