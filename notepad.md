## Roamer Mechanics & Interception
- Roamers move between adjacent maps whenever the player crosses a map boundary.
- Interception: Identify roamer's map via Pokédex. Stay on that map and pace in grass/water.
- Battle Strategy: XENON (Gastly) uses Mean Look immediately to trap. Hypnosis to sleep.
- Repel Trick: Lead PKMN level must be STRICTLY HIGHER than local wild PKMN but < Roamer level (Lv40). Repel only blocks levels LOWER than the lead Pokémon. Route 42 locals reach Lv17, so XENON (Lv17) is not 100% effective. Target: Lv18.
