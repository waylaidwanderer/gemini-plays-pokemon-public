# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Stop Team Rocket.
- **Secondary Goal:** Investigate Radio Tower (Team Rocket takeover).
- **Navigation:** Go to Radio Tower (Northwest Goldenrod).
- **Status:** Navigating to West Goldenrod via Row 9 (The "Golden Corridor").
- **Plan:**
    1. Move Up to (17, 9).
    2. Move West along Row 9 all the way to (6, 9).
    3. Explore the area North of (6, 9) to find the Radio Tower entrance (likely on the East side of the building at x=5).
    4. If blocked, check South of (6, 9).
    5. The "Unknown Warp" and Gym Grunt were distractions. The West side is accessible via y=9.

## Key Information
- **Turn 12001:** Rocket Grunt at (31, 10) is a non-battling blocker.
- **Underground:** "No Entry" door at (18, 6) requires a key or switch.
- **Radio Tower:** Rumored to be taken over.

## Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR:** Standard walkable tile.
- **WALL:** Impassable.

## Reflections (Turn 12001)
- **Execution:** Good immediate responses.
- **Hygiene:** Notepad cleaned up. Grunt behavior noted.
- **Goals:** Clear outcome-focused goals.
- **Hypothesis:** Uniform is needed. If not on a Grunt, maybe it's in the locked room or with a specific NPC I missed.
