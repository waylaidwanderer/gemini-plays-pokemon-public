# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Objective
Trigger the Suicune sighting at (14, 10) in Cianwood City (Map 22_3).

## Strategy: The Western Bypass (Land Route)
1. Obtain Rock Smash: Talk to Pokefan M at (17, 33). (Dialogue triggered, but TM not received. Re-evaluating need.)
2. Wall Gap: Walk West from (16, 33) to (5, 34) to pass through the internal wall.
3. Terrace Ascent: Walk North through Column 4 and climb the one-way slopes:
   - Climb 1: (4, 30) [UP_WALL]
   - Climb 2: (4, 20) [UP_WALL]
4. Northern Loop: Walk North to Row 14, East to (8, 14), North to Row 12, and East to (14, 12).
5. Trigger Event: Reach (14, 10).

## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way North slopes (e.g., (4, 30), (4, 20), (6, 46)).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way South ledges (e.g., (10, 15)).
- WALL: Solid barriers partitioning the city.

## Key Coordinates
- (17, 33): Pokefan M.
- (5, 34): Gap in the central wall.
- (14, 10): Suicune trigger point.
## Strategy: Finding TM08 Rock Smash
- **Start Turn:** 50283
- **Status:** Searching for the TM source.
- **Plan:**
  1. Talk to Standing Youngster at (21, 37). (Completed: Talks about Fly)
  2. Check the house at (17, 41). (Next)
  3. Re-verify Gym Leader Chuck's dialogue if possible.
  4. Explore other houses if needed.

## Failed Hypotheses
- **Hypothesis 1:** Pokefan M (17, 33) gives TM08 after beating Chuck.
  - **Attempts:** 2 (Turns 50278, 50281)
  - **Result:** He only provides a hint about boulders to the north.
- **Hypothesis 2:** Standing Youngster (21, 37) gives TM08.
  - **Attempts:** 1 (Turn 50286)
  - **Result:** He only talks about using Fly to return to Olivine.
