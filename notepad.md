# Current Strategy: Navigate North to Warp (11, 5)
- **Start Turn:** 26738 (Jan 7, 2026)
- **Location:** Silver Cave Room 2 (3_75)
- **Status:** At (6, 13). Moving North to Row 10, then East to Warp (11, 5).
- **Correction:** Previous navigation failed because I didn't include the start coordinate in the path plan. Fixed now.
- **Plan:**
  1. Move West to x=6.
  2. Walk North along x=6 to Row 10.
  3. Walk East to x=11.
  4. Walk North to Warp (11, 5).

# Key Findings
- **Navigation:**
  - **Row 17:** Blocked at x=6 (Wall).
  - **Path North:** Confirmed via Column 6.
  - **Warp (11, 5):** The goal. Connects to Southern Item Rooms.
- **Tile Mechanics:**
  - **Waterfall:** x=6-10 are currents (push back). x=11 is climbable.
