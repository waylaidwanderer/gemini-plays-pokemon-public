# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The West Beach Land Corridor (Verified)
- Plan:
  1. Surf to (10, 24) via gaps at (19, 21) and (18, 26). [IN PROGRESS]
  2. Land at (10, 26) and walk to (4, 28).
  3. Navigate to (2, 31) and walk North along Column 2 to Row 10.
  4. Walk East to (14, 10).
- Status: At (22, 16) surfing, heading south to the first gap.
- Reasoning: Direct northern access is blocked by cliff walls. The buoy maze leads to a landing spot at (10, 26) which provides access to the clear West Beach corridor (X=2). This corridor is clear of ledges all the way to Suicune's plateau.
