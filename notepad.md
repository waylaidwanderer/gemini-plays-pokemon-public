# Quest: Legendary Hunt
- **Target: Suicune (Tin Tower)**
- Start Turn: 46153
- Lore: Three nameless Pokemon perished when Brass Tower burned 700 years ago. Ho-Oh gave them new life as Suicune, Entei, and Raikou.
- Plan:
    1. Release Beasts (Burned Tower) - DONE (Turn 46247).
    2. Defeat Wise Trio (WiseTriosRoom 4_2) - IN PROGRESS.
    3. Battle Suicune (Tin Tower).
- Status: Searching for Wise Trio. Sage at (5, 8) says Suicune is at the top. Heading to WiseTriosRoom (4_2).

# Strategy: Suicune Capture (Tactical Analysis)
- Lead: XENON (Haunter, Lv 44).
- Moves: Hypnosis (Priority 1).
- Damage: Night Shade x3 (Fixed 132 damage total). Safe for Lv 40 Suicune (~130-140 HP).
- Tank: GORP (Snorlax, Lv 50). High Sp.Def for Surf/Aurora Beam.
- Backup: KIMCHI (Gloom) for Sleep Powder or Stun Spore.
- Items: Ultra Balls (32).

# Observations: Wise Trio
- Hypothesis: They appear in WiseTriosRoom (4_2) after the tower shakes.
- Test: Re-enter 4_2 via ladder at (17, 3) in 4_1.
- Note: Sage at (5, 8) in 4_1 talks about Suicune but doesn't battle.
- Roadblock: Room 4_2 was empty on turn 46259. Re-checking now.
