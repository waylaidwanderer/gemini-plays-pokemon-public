# Current Strategy
## Resupply Run
- **Goal:** Buy Super Repels in Celadon.
- **Location:** Celadon Dept. Store (5F).
- **Action:** Talk to Clerk at (7, 5).
- **Status:** Clearing Text -> Moving to Left Clerk.
- **Reasoning:** Right Clerk had Battle Items. Checking Left Clerk.
- **Correction:** If 5F fails, return to 2F. I didn't scroll down on the 2F Left Clerk's list (Medicines). Repels might be there.
