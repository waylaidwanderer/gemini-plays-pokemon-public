# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
## Strategy: Great Southern Loop (Row 51)
Reach (14, 10) by bypassing all land ledges via Row 51.
1. Move North out of the current pocket to Row 44.
2. Move West to X=4.
3. Move South to Row 51 (bypasses ledges at Row 46, 48, 50).
4. Walk West along Row 51 to X=2 corridor.
5. Walk North along X=2 to Row 12 (bypasses Row 15 ledge).
6. Walk East to (14, 12) and North to (14, 10).
- Current Step: Moving towards (2, 51) via Row 44 and X=4 corridor.

# Progress Notes
- Dead End Pocket: (12-19, 46-49) blocks South/West exit at Row 49/50. Must exit via Row 46, 48, or 50 gaps.
- Verified: Row 46 gap (18, 46), Row 48 gap (12, 48), and Row 50 gap (10, 50) are the keys to the southern loop.
- X=4 corridor is a clear path from Row 44 to Row 51.
- X=2 corridor is a clear path from Row 51 to Row 12.
