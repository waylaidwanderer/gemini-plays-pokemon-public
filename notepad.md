# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Challenge the Pokémon League.
- **Secondary:** Obtain Extremespeed Dratini (Dragon's Den).
- **Tertiary:** Get Master Ball (New Bark Town).
- **Immediate:** Deposit a Pokemon at Blackthorn PC.

# Current Status (Turn 18409)
- **Location:** Dragon's Den 1F (5, 13).
- **Action:** Re-triggering Ladder to B1F.
- **Reasoning:** Unexpectedly warped to (5, 13) from (3, 3). Ladder at (5, 13) should lead to B1F (20, 3). Need to step off and on to trigger it.
- **Goal:** Reach Dragon Shrine on B1F.

# Plan
1. Step Right to (6, 13).
2. Step Left to (5, 13) (Trigger Ladder).
3. Arrive on B1F (20, 3).
4. Surf South/East to Shrine.
5. Get Dratini.
6. Fly to New Bark Town.

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Obstacle. Requires HM06 + Badge.
- **Buoy:** Obstacle.
- **Lava/Magma:** (None here).
- **Ice:** (None here).
- **Warp Carpets:** Some (like Dragon's Den 1F exit) may be arrival-only or directional.

# Lessons
- **Menu Navigation:** Always verify cursor position.
- **Map Reading:** Verify tile types (Buoy vs Whirlpool).
- **Warps:** If a warp doesn't trigger, try different approach angles or assume it's one-way.
