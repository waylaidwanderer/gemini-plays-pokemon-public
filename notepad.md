# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard ground. Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Surf required. Traversable.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- DOOR: Warp point.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable cliff face (e.g., Row 15, Row 30, Row 34).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
- BREAKABLE ROCK: Requires Rock Smash. Impassable.
- NPC: Impassable. Interact from adjacent tile.

# Blocked Routes (Verified)
- Central City: Split by a vertical wall at X=9 (Rows 34-37) and a cliff at Row 30.
- West Beach Access: Clear path found via Row 32/33 (X=9 gap) and Row 35 (X=6 gap).

# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The West Beach Ascent
- Plan:
  1. Use Super Repel in PACK. [DONE]
  2. Navigate to (19, 30). [DONE]
  3. Walk to (2, 14) via Row 32 (gap at X=9) and Row 35 (gap at X=6). [IN PROGRESS]
  4. Walk East to (14, 10).
- Status: At (19, 30) on land.
- Reasoning: X=2 is a clear highway to the northern plateau. Navigating the city gaps at (9, 32) and (6, 35) bypasses the central blockades.
