# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Reach the Dragon Shrine via the East Whirlpool.

# Current Status (Turn 18307)
- **Location:** Dragon's Den B1F (25, 22).
- **Action:** Move to (24, 22) and interact with Whirlpool at (24, 23).
- **Reasoning:** 
    - Attempt to use Whirlpool on (25, 23) via menu failed ("Can't use that here").
    - This suggests (25, 23) is either not a whirlpool or not the interaction point.
    - (24, 23) is marked as a Whirlpool in my notes.
    - Lapis is now Lead (Slot 1), which might fix the previous failure at (24, 23).
- **Sequence:**
  1. `Left` (Move to 24, 22).
  2. `Down` (Face Whirlpool at 24, 23).
  3. `A` (Interact).
  4. `A` (Confirm).

# Plan
1. Interact with Whirlpool at (24, 23) with Lapis as Lead.
2. If successful, clear it and move South.
3. If fails, try Menu -> Whirlpool on (24, 23).

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Obstacle. Requires HM06 + Badge. Interactive point likely specific.

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Requires HM06 Whirlpool + Glacier Badge. 
- **Lava/Magma:** (None here).
- **Ice:** (None here).

# Lessons
- **Menu Navigation:** Always verify cursor position before committing to a sequence. Blind input leads to wrong menus (e.g., PACK instead of POKEMON).
