# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement. Passable from SOUTH to NORTH. Found at (4, 20), (16, 10), (8, 34), (6, 46), (8, 48), (9, 48), (10, 48), (12, 50).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at (10, 15).
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- Start Turn: 49774
- Start Time: 3:32 PM

## Strategy: The Great Southern Loop
The northern plateau (Row 10-15) is accessible via the Western Corridor (X=0-2).
1. Land at (19, 30) (Completed).
2. Navigate to Row 51 to bypass the main city walls:
   - (9, 44) -> (18, 44)
   - (18, 44) -> (18, 46) (Gap in Row 46 ledge)
   - (18, 46) -> (12, 46)
   - (12, 46) -> (12, 48) (Gap in Row 48 ledge)
   - (12, 48) -> (10, 48)
   - (10, 48) -> (10, 50) (Gap in Row 50 ledge)
   - (10, 50) -> (10, 51)
3. Walk West to (2, 51) to enter the Western Corridor.
4. Walk North through the corridor to (2, 14).
5. Walk East to (8, 14), then North to Row 12 (to bypass X=9 wall).
6. Walk East along Row 12 to (14, 12), then North to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

## Hypotheses
- H1: The Western Corridor (X=0-2) is a continuous path from Row 51 to Row 14. (Partially verified by Mental Map).
- H2: (14, 10) is the trigger point for the Suicune sighting. (Marked in Mental Map).
- H3: Row 14 is walkable from X=2 to X=8.

# Progress Notes
- Verified: Row 15, X=0-2 is FLOOR (Ledge bypass).
- Verified: Row 34-39, X=5 is FLOOR/unseen (Potential bypass, but Southern Loop is more certain).
- SUPER REPEL is active.
