# Suicune Quest Log (Crystal Version)

- Status: Searching for Suicune sighting #3 or #4.

## Sighting Progress
1. Burned Tower: Verified.
2. Cianwood City (North): Verified.
3. Route 42 (Central Island): [IN PROGRESS] Route 36 verified empty. Returning for a tile-by-tile search (24, 12 to 31, 17 area).
4. Route 36 (Sudowoodo Junction): [EMPTY] Verified on Turn 25992.

## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Traversable with SURF.
- CUT_TREE: Impassable; remove with CUT.
- LADDER: Vertical transition (Warp).
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable from the NORTH (cannot move DOWN into it). Acts as a wall or ledge bottom.

## Strategy
- Current: Fly to Violet City and navigate to Route 36 (near Sudowoodo spot) to check for Suicune.
- Pivot: If Suicune is NOT found on Route 36, return to Ecruteak and re-investigate the Wise Trio Room and Tin Tower Gatehouse.

## Timestamps
- Suicune Quest Start: Turn 24182.
- Failed Route 42 Island Sweep: Turn 25893, 25974.
- Pivot to Route 36: Turn 25981.
- Suicune Tracker Advice: Route 42 sighting is mandatory before Route 36. If Route 36 is empty, return to Route 42 and perform a tile-by-tile sweep of the island (24, 13 to 30, 17 area).
- Verification: Route 36 (35, 9) check in progress.
