# Strategic Plan: Mt. Silver & Red
- **Strategy (The HOW):**
    1. Collect Protein at (15, 29). (In progress).
    2. Head to (1, 35) then (0, 34) to access the left corridor (X=0) to reach the upper level.
    3. Collect item at (7, 18).
    4. Explore SilverCaveRoom1 to find the ladder to the next floor. Path seems to involve the far left (X=0) or right (X=19) corridors.
    5. Face Red at the peak.
