- **Party:** Healthy. Muscle (Lv61) leading.
- **Inventory:** 6 Hyper Potions, 10 Revives, 2 Full Restores.
- **Money:** Low (¥589).

# Exploration Log
- **Victory Road:** Fully traversed.
- **Indigo Plateau:** Lobby explored. Shopping done.

# Plan
1.  **Battle:** Talk to Will and win.
    - **Strategy:** Muscle (Lv61) spams Strength.
    - **Reasoning:** Strength (Normal) is neutral vs all his dual-Psychic types (Flying, Ice, Grass, Water). Cross Chop (Fighting) is resisted by Psychic and Flying, making it poor vs Xatu, Exeggutor, Slowbro.
    - **Matchup:** Muscle outlevels by ~20 levels. Expect OHKOs.
2.  **Next:** Advance to Koga's room.
- **Battle Update:** Xatu survived first Strength (~45% HP remaining). Confuse Ray is problematic.
- **Action:** Using Full Restore to heal HP and cure Confusion. Priority is keeping Muscle healthy and active.
- **Turn 19091:** Previous attempt to use Full Restore was partially blocked (mixed inputs). Cursor is now on Full Restore. Confirming usage on Muscle.
- **Turn 19094:** Full Restore successful. Muscle at 100% HP and cured.
- **Next:** Opponent's turn (Xatu will attack). Then Muscle attacks with Strength.
- **Turn 19095:** Full Restore healed Muscle to max, but Xatu used Psychic (Crit or High Roll? ~80 dmg). Muscle HP 120/201.
- **Next:** Muscle outspeeds. Strength to finish Xatu.
- **Turn 19096:** Selected Fight -> Strength (Manual input due to cursor memory on PACK). Finishing Xatu.
- **Anticipation:** Will sends Jynx or Exeggutor next. Muscle stays in.
- **Turn 19097:** Retrying Strength (Turn 19096 inputs didn't register/menu state persisted). Muscle (120/201) vs Xatu (~45%).
- **Observation:** Muscle is faster than Xatu (based on Turn 19085). Should KO.
- **Turn 19098:** Accidental Full Restore confirmed (Tool assumed cursor at FIGHT, but it was at PACK). Muscle at 100% HP. Now waiting for Xatu's turn.
- **Correction:** Must manually navigate menu (Up -> Fight) next turn.
- **Turn 19099:** Muscle confused (again). Cursor on PACK.
- **Action:** Manual navigate to FIGHT (Up) -> STRENGTH (A -> A).
- **Status:** Muscle 201/201 (Confused). Xatu ~45%.
- **Note:** Used 2 Full Restores? Game State lists "FULL RESTORE" (1?). Saving it.
- **Turn 19102:** Xatu fainted. Muscle grew to Lv 62. Stats: 99/205 HP, 88 Speed.
- **Analysis:** Will sending Jynx (Lv 41, Base Spd 95). Jynx likely faster (>90 Spd). Psychic (~110 dmg) will KO Muscle (99 HP).
- **Plan:** Decline Switch -> Use Hyper Potion (Priority) -> Survive Psychic -> OHKO with Strength.
- **Turn 19103:** Confirmed "NO" to switch. Jynx coming out.
- **Action:** Use Hyper Potion on Muscle immediately.
- **Turn 19105:** In Bag. Selected Hyper Potion.
- **Action:** Confirm Use on Muscle.
- **Next:** Muscle heals. Jynx attacks (Psychic). Muscle survives -> Strength KO next turn.
- **Turn 19106:** Used Hyper Potion on Muscle.
- **Anticipation:** Muscle heals to full. Jynx attacks (Psychic). Muscle survives with ~50% HP.
- **Next Turn:** Use Strength to OHKO Jynx.
- **Turn 19107:** Selected "USE" on Hyper Potion.
- **Next:** Select Muscle to apply.
- **Battle State:** Muscle (99/205) will heal to full. Jynx will attack (Priority: Item > Speed). Muscle survives.
- **Turn 19108:** Input 'A' failed to apply potion (likely timing). Retrying.
- **Action:** Press A to apply Hyper Potion to Muscle.
- **Battle Calc:** Jynx Psychic deals ~80 dmg. Muscle (205 HP) survives easily. Strength OHKOs Jynx next turn.
