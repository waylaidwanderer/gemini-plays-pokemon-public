# Underground Warehouse Switch Puzzle

**Goal:** Open Gate 3 (16, 6) to find the Director.

**Confirmed Mechanics:**
- **Gate 1 (2, 6):** Opens with **Switch 3 ON** (State 0-0-1).
- **Gate 2 (10, 6):** Opens with **Switch 3 ON + Switch 1 ON** (State 1-0-1). Also opened with Seq 3->2->1 (State 1-1-1).
- **Gate 3 (16, 6):** **OPEN** with **Switch 1 ON** (State 1-0-0).
- **Correction:** Switch 2 was ON. State 1-1-1 (All ON) confirmed Gate 1 CLOSED.
