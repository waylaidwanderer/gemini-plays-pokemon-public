# Recent Discoveries
- Found Max Revive at (6, 3) in the isolated Left Section of the Item Room.

# Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Acts as a South-facing Ledge (verified). Blocks North movement.
- **Warp Carpet:** Located at Row 29/31. Avoid stepping on them unless exiting.
- **Waterfall Mechanics:** Walking into a waterfall causes a slide-back, setting facing to DOWN. To ascend, ensure facing UP (move away and back if needed) then press A to interact. Requires HM07.

# Map Structure (Silver Cave)
- Upper Ledge is segmented. Center (13) connects to Left (6), but Right (17) is blocked by Wall at Col 16.
- **Route 2 Navigation:** To head North from the entrance, use the gap in the ledge at (7, 47). The tree at (10, 40) blocks the path further North.
- **Observation:** Failed to warp to Route 28 when walking Left over (1, 7). Currently at (0, 7).
- **Hypothesis:** I may have skipped the trigger or "jumped" over it. Retrying by walking back onto (1, 7).
