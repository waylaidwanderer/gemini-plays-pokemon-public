# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Obstacle. Requires HM06 + Badge.
- **Water Moves:** Special in Gen 2. Gyarados uses Sp.Atk for Surf/Waterfall.
- **Warp Carpets:** Directional exits.
- **Milestone:** Stepped into Kanto on Route 27! (Turn 18570)
- **Exploration:** Ascended the waterfall in Tohjo Falls. Now exploring the upper level. (Turn 18586)
- **Navigation:** Top level appears to be a water channel leading to a descending waterfall on the east side.

- **Exploration:** Reached the lower eastern landing of Tohjo Falls. Proceeding to exit. (Turn 18592)
- **Exploration:** Exited Tohjo Falls to Route 27 East. Encountered Cooltrainer F at (37, 6).
- **Observation:** There is a house at (33, 7) which appears unreachable from the current position due to ledges/walls. It might be accessible from the west side or via a specific path. (Turn 18593)
- **Exploration:** Accessibility to House at (33, 7) confirmed from this side. Will investigate. (Turn 18609)
- **Exploration:** Entered the house on Route 27 (Map 24_12). There is an old lady (Granny) inside. (Turn 18612)
- **Interaction:** Granny at (2,4) in Route 27 House gives advice on trust/loyalty (Friendship check). Does not heal. (Turn 18615)
- **Lesson:** Do not switch low-level Pokémon into high-power moves (e.g., Solarbeam) relying solely on resistance. Base stats are critical. (Turn 18643)
- **Mechanic:** Abilities (like Intimidate) do not exist in Gen 2. Don't rely on them. (Turn 18662)
