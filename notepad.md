- **South Access:** Blocked by ledges.
- **Current Action:** Attempting to Fly from South of Indigo Plateau (Route 23 is No Fly Zone).

# Current Strategy

# Wild Pokemon Locations

- **Fly Map Navigation:**
    - Indigo Plateau -> Down -> Saffron City.
    - Saffron City -> Up -> Indigo Plateau (Unexpected! result).
    - **Conclusion:** Saffron and Indigo are vertically linked. Cerulean might be `Right` from Pewter or `Up` from Vermilion/Lavender.
- **Current Status:**
    - Landed at Indigo Plateau (Route 23).
    - Cannot Fly from here (No-Fly Zone).
    - Must walk South to Gatehouse (16_2).
    - **Hope:** Gatehouse connects to Route 22 (Viridian) to Fly.
    - **Fear:** Gatehouse connects to Victory Road (Must traverse again).
- **Next Action:** Walk South -> Enter Gatehouse.
