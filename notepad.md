# Pokémon Crystal Journey

## Current Plan
- **Objective:** Defeat the Rival, then return to New Bark Town to help Professor Elm.
- **Route:** Exit Cherrygrove City to the east to get to Route 29, then head east.

## Current Quest
- **A Pokémon has been stolen from Professor Elm's lab!** The thief, a red-haired boy, has ambushed me. I must defeat him and get back to New Bark Town.

## Long-term Goal
- Become the Pokémon League Champion.

## The Rival
- A red-haired boy who stole a Pokémon from Professor Elm's lab.
- I am currently battling him in Cherrygrove City. He has a Totodile.

## Key Items
- **POKéGEAR:** Received from Mom. Has a Phone feature.
- **POKéDEX:** Received from Professor Oak. Automatically records data on Pokémon.
- **MYSTERY EGG:** Received from Mr. Pokémon. Needs to be taken to Professor Elm.

## Mechanics & Discoveries
### System Mechanics
- **Warp Mechanics:** Some warp tiles may require stepping off of them and then back on to activate.
- **SELECT Button:** Can be used to register a key item for quick use.
### Environmental Mechanics
- **Route 29 Ledges:** The western section of Route 29 has one-way ledges preventing eastward travel from that area.
- **Route 46:** This route is a dead-end when approached from the south due to one-way ledges.
- **CUT_TREE:** These small trees are impassable and require the HM 'Cut' to be removed.
### Battle Mechanics
- **Held Items (Berries):** Some Pokémon can hold items like Berries, which they can use automatically in battle to heal themselves when their HP gets low.
- **Smokescreen:** Lowers the opponent's accuracy.
### Item Effects
- **POTION:** Heals a Pokémon for 20 HP.

## Wild Pokémon Encounters
### Route 29 (Tall Grass)
- **Hoppip** (Lv. 2-3): Knows Splash
- **Sentret** (Lv. 2-3): Knows Tackle
- **Pidgey** (Lv. 2-3): Knows Tackle
- **Rattata** (Lv. 2): Knows Tackle
- **Hoothoot** (Lv. 3): Knows Tackle

## Important NPCs
- **Professor Elm** (New Bark Town): Gave me Hestia and his phone number. A Pokémon was stolen from his lab.
- **Mom** (New Bark Town): Gave me the POKéGEAR.
- **MR. POKEMON** (Route 30): Gave me the MYSTERY EGG.
- **Professor Oak** (met at Mr. Pokémon's House): Gave me the POKéDEX.

## Radio Broadcasts
- **Professor Oak's Pokémon Talk:** Abra may be seen around Route 35.

## Puzzle Solutions
- **Cherrygrove House Lock:** Became stuck at (3, 1). Solution was to turn to face the TV at (2, 1) and interact with it ('A' button).
- **Mr. Pokémon's House Exit:** Became stuck on the exit warp at (2, 7). Solution was to press 'Start' to open the menu, then 'B' to close it.
- **Cherrygrove City Stuck State:** Became stuck at (14, 11) after rival event. Solution was to open and close the main menu with 'Start' then 'B'.

## Self-Corrections & Failed Hypotheses
- The path to Cherrygrove City is through Route 29. My initial assumption that it was a dead end was incorrect.
- The west exit of Cherrygrove City is not accessible from the southern path. The main exit to Route 29 is on the east side of the city at (39, 7).
