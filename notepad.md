# I. Quest Log

- **Current Quest: The Mt. Moon Fossil**
    - **Objective:** Find a way past the Rocket Grunt at Mt. Moon B2F (30,12) or the Hiker at 1F (6,7).
    - **Status:** Active. Current focus is testing new hypotheses generated by the puzzle_solver_agent.
- **Stalled Quest: The Copycat's Gift**
    - **Objective:** Obtain a POKé DOLL and give it to COPYCAT.
    - **Status:** Stalled. All leads in Cerulean City have been exhausted. Suspect COPYCAT is not in a currently accessible area.

# II. Fossil Quest - Hypotheses Log

- **Active Hypotheses (Ranked by Agent):**
    1.  **Hiker Disguise:** The Hiker on 1F will move if a 'Hiker' Pokémon (like Geodude) is in the party lead.
    2.  **Poké Doll for Hiker:** The Hiker on 1F will accept the POKé DOLL.

- **Failed Hypotheses:**
    - The Silph Scope will reveal a ghost in Mt. Moon, or the Grunt himself is a ghost. (Result: Failed. Prof. Oak prevents the item's use.)
    - The Rocket Grunt on B2F will accept the POKé DOLL as the 'fossil'. (Result: Failed. Prof. Oak prevents the item's use.)
    - Giving the POKé DOLL to the Grunt will make the Hiker on 1F move. (Result: Dependent on failed hypothesis, invalidated.)
    - The Hiker will only move for an 'adult', a status temporarily gained by interacting with the 'Old Man' in Viridian City. (Result: Failed. Hiker's dialogue was unchanged.)
    - The fossil is in an interactable rock.
    - The Hiker on 1F at (6,7) will move if shown the revived HELIX fossil Pokémon.
    - The scientist in the Cinnabar Lab Fossil Room can 'un-revive' a fossil Pokémon.
    - Presenting the revived HELIX fossil Pokémon to the Rocket Grunt on B2F will trigger a new event.
    - The 'fossil' the Rocket Grunt wants is the MOON STONE.
    - A specific, non-fossil Pokémon from Mt. Moon (e.g., Geodude) will satisfy the Grunt.
    - The Hiker on Mt. Moon 1F at (6,7) is part of a chained quest.
    - The 'fossil' the Grunt wants must be stolen from the Pewter City Museum of Science.
    - The move 'Dig' must be used on a specific, unmarked tile within Mt. Moon to unearth the other fossil.
    - The Rocket Grunt will accept a Pokémon nicknamed 'fossil'.
    - The Hiker on Mt. Moon 1F at (6,7) will trade you for your revived fossil Pokémon.
    - A ladder's destination can be changed by entering and exiting it multiple times.
    - There is a hidden, one-way passage concealed in the western wall on 1F.
    - The Escape Rope item functions differently within Mt. Moon.
    - A rock is a disguised ladder that requires a Clefairy in the party.
    - The Hiker is thirsty and needs a drink item.
    - An un-revived fossil can be acquired by fishing inside Mt. Moon.
    - The Rocket Grunt will accept a thematically 'fossil' Pokémon like Marowak.
    - The Pokémon Tower is a red herring for the fossil quest.
    - Interacting with the second Rocket Grunt on B2F at (30, 18) will open a new path or provide a clue. (Result: Failed. Dialogue was generic and unchanged.)
    - Evolving a Clefairy with a Moon Stone in front of the Grunt will trigger an event. (Result: Failed. Prof. Oak prevents the item's use.)
    - Speaking to the Old Man in Viridian City will influence an NPC in Mt. Moon. (Result: Failed. Dialogue was unchanged.)

- **Untested Assumptions:**
    - The Hiker on 1F and the Rocket Grunt on B2F are part of the same puzzle. They might be two separate roadblocks.
    - The solution involves *giving* an item/Pokémon to an NPC. The solution could be an environmental trigger or showing a specific Pokémon state.

    - Water > Rock/Ground
    - Water is not very effective against Bug/Grass, Ghost/Poison
    - Poison is not very effective against Poison/Flying, Rock/Ground
    - Flying is not very effective against Rock/Ground
- **Notable Trainer Rosters:**
    - **Sabrina (Saffron Gym):** MR. MIME (Lv 65), HYPNO (Lv 64), SLOWBRO (Lv 64), JYNX (Lv 64), GENGAR (Lv 64), ALAKAZAM (Lv 65).

# IV. Game Mechanics & Rules

- **Anomalous Mechanics:**
    - **POKé DOLL Escape:** A POKé DOLL can be used to guarantee an escape from a wild Pokémon battle.
    - **Battle Menu Anomaly:** The game appears to intentionally restrict move selection in certain wild battles to the first move slot.
    - **Party Menu 'SWITCH' Lock:** The game can prevent using the 'SWITCH' command in the party menu, observed after multiple failed escape attempts.
    - **Shop Menu Navigation Anomaly:** The Cerulean Mart shop menu does not follow a standard grid layout and requires 'B' to exit.
    - **PC Withdrawal/Deposit Anomaly:** The PC has a non-standard, fixed behavior. Selecting 'WITHDRAW PKMN' automatically withdraws the first Pokémon in the box list if the party has space. Selecting 'DEPOSIT PKMN' automatically deposits the lead Pokémon in the party. There is no option to choose which Pokémon to withdraw or deposit.
- **Area-Specific Mechanics:**
    - **Pewter Museum Trap Tile:** On Pewter Museum 2F, the tile at (3,5) is a trap that warps the player to an isolated room. Escape requires interacting with a follower Pikachu.
    - **Pokemon Tower 6F Healer Change:** The friendly Channeler at (13,11) is no longer a healer. Her dialogue has changed to 'I feel anemic and weak...'.

# V. Tile Mechanics & Interaction Rules
- **General Traversal:**
    - `ledge`: Can only be jumped down (from Y-1 to Y+2 in one move). Impassable from all other directions.
    - `steps`: The only way to move between `ground` and `elevated_ground` tiles.
- **PC Tile:** This tile is often typed as `grass`. Interaction requires standing on the tile directly below it (e.g., at (X, Y+1) for a PC at (X, Y)) and facing up.

# VI. Untested Assumptions & Future Tests
- **'CHANGE BOX' Functionality:** It's assumed that changing boxes does not affect the order of Pokémon within a box. This needs to be tested to see if it could simplify the PC shuffling process.

# VII. Agent & Tool Development Log

- **`pc_shuffler_agent`:** Defined in turn 215166. **CRITICAL FAILURE (Corrected):** I failed to use this agent immediately after creation, instead performing a lengthy manual shuffle. I have now corrected this by using the agent in Viridian City (Turn 215239) to validate its effectiveness and fix my procedural error.

# VIII. Self-Assessment Insights (Turn 215319)

- **Mt. Moon Quest Solvability:** A major untested assumption is that the Mt. Moon fossil quest is solvable *at this point in the game*. If the current 'Hiker's Pokémon' hypothesis fails, I must consider that I may be missing a key item or event trigger from an unexplored post-game area. I will pivot to a different objective if this next test fails.
