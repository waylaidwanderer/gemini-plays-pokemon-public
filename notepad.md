- **Discoveries:**
    - Gyarados rampage at Lake of Rage (Gramps).
    - Mahogany Mart suspicious (Stairs locked).
    - Bug Catching Contest today.
- Fishing Guru (Lake of Rage House): Explains lake lore. Worried about Magikarp. Might need to clear Lake of Rage event first.
- Flight Miscalculation: Aimed for Goldenrod, landed in Olivine. Need to be more careful with Fly menu selection.
- Checking Olivine Mart for Ultra Balls.
- Olivine Mart: Does NOT sell Ultra Balls. Only sells Standard/Great Balls, Potions, Heals, and Mail.
