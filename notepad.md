### Current Objectives
1. **Find Floria**: Located at Route 36 (North of Route 35).
2. **Get SquirtBottle**: Return to Flower Shop (19, 1) after finding Floria.
3. **Clear Sudowoodo**: Use SquirtBottle on Route 36.

### Exploration Status
- **Route 35**: The North-East cul-de-sac at (31, 7) is a dead end. Blocked by walls at x=35 and Row 5.
- **Hypothesis**: The path to Route 35 requires accessing the far East corridor (x=36) from the South (near Row 34?), or navigating West of the Radio Tower.
- **Plan**: Backtrack to Main Road, head South, and investigate access to the East side (x>35) from the bottom of the map.
- **Center (x=6-17)**: Blocked at Row 5 by Walls and Underground Entrance (9,5).
- **West (x<6)**: Radio Tower area. Need to investigate path West of Radio Tower (x=3) or Tracks (x=0-1).

### Validated Locations
- **Flower Shop**: (19, 1).
- **Underground Entrance**: (9, 5).
- **Radio Tower**: (5, 15).
- **Gym**: (24, 7).

### Quest Log
- **Badges**: Zephyr, Hive, Plain.
- **Party**: Quilava (27), Bellsprout (6), Togepi (5), Rattata (8), Igglybuff (5).
- **West Narrow Path**: Explored (x=3, y=15). Dead end to the North.
- **Correction**: Re-orienting North to Route 35 to reach Route 36. The previous Southward movement was a navigation error.
- **Tracks**: Possible path North along the tracks (x=0-1)? Need to find access point (likely South).
