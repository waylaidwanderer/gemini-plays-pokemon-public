# Map Structure & Route
- **Goldenrod Underground (3_53):** Divided into isolated sections.
  - **Main Tunnel:** Top & West areas. Contains (3, 2) Ladder and (3, 34) Ladder.
  - **Southeast Room:** Isolated. Contains Ladder (22, 27) and Warp (21, 31).
  - **Connection:** Map 3_54 (Warehouse Entrance) connects the Main Tunnel (via 3, 2) and Southeast Room (via 22, 27).
- **Current Location:** Northwest Room (Map 3_54).
- **Goal:** Reach Emergency Switch at (20, 11).

# Strategy
- **Puzzle Mechanic:** "Open one shutter, another closes." Order matters.
- **Sequence Attempt:** 1 -> 2 -> 3.
- **Current Status:** Switch 1 ON. Switch 2 OFF. Switch 3 OFF.
- **Observations:**
    - Vertical 2 (10, 6) CLOSED.
    - Vertical 4 (16, 6) OPEN (Observed Row 6 change to Floor).
- **New Plan:**
    1. Navigate to (16, 6) and pass through the open shutter.
    2. Explore the Southern area.
    3. Attempt to reach Emergency Switch (20, 11) by looping around (possibly from below or checking for other openings).

# Important Locations
- **Switch 1:** Map 3_54 (ON).
- **Switch 2:** Map 3_54 (ON).
- **Switch 3:** Map 3_54 (OFF).
- **Emergency Switch:** (20, 11).
- **Eddie:** (3, 8) - West Path Dead End.

# Archive (Completed/Failed)
- **Blockage:** Path South (Row 10) blocked in all columns with previous configs.
- **West Path:** Confirmed Dead End.
- **Switch History:**
    - Sw 1 ON: Closes Vertical 2 (10, 6/7).
    - Sw 3 ON: Opens Top 1-2 (6, 8) & Bottom 2-3 (12, 12). Closes Top 2-3 (12, 8).
- **Observation:** Switch 3 OFF caused Shutter (6, 8) to Close (FLOOR -> WALL). This confirms Switch 3 controls Shutter 1-2 (Top).
