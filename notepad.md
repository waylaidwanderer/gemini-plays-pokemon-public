- Houndoom: Dark/Fire. Use Gneiss (Earthquake) or Calcifer (Return).
- Note: No healing items left besides Berries and Revives. Strategy must be aggressive.

## persistence Knowledge
### Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- LADDER: Traversable. Transition to another map.
- WARP_CARPET: Walking off map edge triggers transition.
- DARKNESS: Visual effect only, does not affect movement.

### Lessons Learned
- Hypnosis Failure: Don't overthink misses (60% accuracy). It's rarely immunity unless specified.
- Menu Precision: Always verify cursor position before pressing A. Use small sequences.
- Rock Slide: Machamp has Rock coverage. Be careful with Flying/Fire/Bug types.
### Menu Navigation
- Main Menu Order: POKEDEX, POKEMON, PACK, GEAR, [PLAYER], SAVE, OPTION, EXIT.
- Party Sub-Menu Order: STATS, SWITCH, ITEM, CANCEL.
## Lead Swap Attempts (Karen)
- Attempt 1 (Turn 37433): Failed. Cursor management in main menu incorrect.
- Attempt 2 (Turn 37434): Failed. Cursor on XENON instead of ICARUS.
- Attempt 3 (Turn 37442): Failed. Menu opened at OPTION instead of POKEMON.
- Attempt 4 (Turn 37450): Failed. Cursor management in main menu incorrect.
- Attempt 5 (Turn 37451): Failed. Menu opened at OPTION instead of POKEMON.
- Strategy: Move to (5, 11) to clear tile warning, then perform swap carefully.
- Attempt 6 (Turn 37454): Failed. Cursor stayed on Pokedex despite Down press. Menu was open.
- Attempt 7 (Turn 37456): Planned. Using 'Up' spam to reset cursors in main menu and party menu. Note: ICARUS has FLY, so SWITCH is the 3rd option (Down x2).
- HM Sub-menu logic: Each HM/TM move (like FLY, SURF, FLASH) adds an entry at the top of the Pokémon's sub-menu. ICARUS has one (FLY), so the order is: FLY, STATS, SWITCH, ITEM, CANCEL.
- Attempt 8 (Turn 37457): Planned. Sequence: Start, Down (to Pokemon), A, A (select Icarus), Down, Down (to Switch), A, Down, Down (to Calcifer), A, B, B, B. Using sleep 200 between actions.
## Battle with Karen (Turn 37458)
- Attempt 8 (Turn 37457): Failed. Triggered battle instead of swap. ICARUS is leading.
- Strategy: Switch to Calcifer immediately. Beware of Umbreon's Sand-Attack and Confuse Ray.
## Battle with Karen (Cont.)
- Turn 37463-37466: Calcifer (123/174 HP) vs Umbreon (~25% HP).
- Move Selection: Return (Physical) used twice.
- Goal: Finish Umbreon with Return.
- Next: Prepare for Vileplume, Gengar, Murkrow, or Houndoom. Use Calcifer or Gneiss accordingly.
