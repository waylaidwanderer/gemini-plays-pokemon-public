# Mt. Moon Exploration Plan

**Core Strategy:** A system update has improved agent reliability. I will now use the `pathfinder_agent` for all navigation.

**Methodology:**
1.  **Identify POIs:** Use the `dungeon_path_analyzer_agent` to get the coordinates of Points of Interest (trainers, items, warps).
2.  **Generate Path:** Use the `pathfinder_agent` to generate a precise path to the desired POI.
3.  **Execute Path:** Follow the agent's path exactly.

# Agent Status & Improvement Plan
- **`pathfinder_agent`:** Now considered the primary tool for navigation due to system updates.
- **`dungeon_path_analyzer_agent`:** Remains useful for identifying POI coordinates to provide to the pathfinder.

# Battle Learnings
- **Type Matchups:**
  - Electric is ineffective vs. Ground (Geodude, Sandshrew).
  - Grass is 4x effective vs. Rock/Ground (Geodude).
  - Electric is NOT very effective vs. Bug/Grass (Paras).
  - Electric is NOT very effective vs. Grass/Poison (Oddish, Bellsprout).
  - Defensive immunities aren't everything. Geodude's Poison immunity is less valuable against Ekans (who uses Normal moves) than Oddish's 4x super-effective Grass attack.
- **Risk Management:** Do not switch in low-level, non-resistant Pok√©mon to weaken wild encounters.

# Dungeon Mechanics
- **Defeated Trainers:** Defeated trainers in Mt. Moon and on Route 3 act as impassable obstacles.
- **Trap Ladder:** The ladder at (26, 16) on 1F is a one-way trap that leads back to 1F. Do not use.

- **`pathfinder_agent` failure (T6640):** The agent failed to generate a path on Mt. Moon B1F. The error indicated an invalid JSON response during the code generation step. I will monitor for further failures and refine the agent if the problem persists.

- **`pathfinder_agent` failure (T6680):** Agent failed to path around `elevated_ground` on Mt. Moon B2F, treating it as a passable tile from below. This is a critical navigation flaw.

# AI Critique Learnings (T6691)
- My agents (`pathfinder_agent`, `dungeon_path_analyzer_agent`) have critical flaws in understanding map verticality (`elevated_ground`, `steps`) and warp reachability. I MUST prioritize refining their prompts before further use.
- My exploration strategy has been inefficient. I need to stop chasing every unseen tile and instead use a high-level map analysis to identify key paths and junctions, avoiding obvious dead ends.
- New Hypothesis: The steps at `(29,8)` lead to an isolated platform. The main western plateau is likely accessed via another set of steps, possibly at `(27,16)`. I will investigate this next.
