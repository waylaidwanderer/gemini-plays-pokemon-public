# Tile Mechanics: Route 45
- TALL_GRASS: Traversable. Triggers wild encounters. Verified at (12, 10), (13, 10).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way traversal (Down). Verified at (13, 9), (12, 13), (4, 41), (2, 55), (2, 63), (4, 77).
- WALL: Impassable. Verified at (13, 12).
- FLOOR: Traversable. Verified at (12, 6).

# Strategy: Rising Badge (Gym Leader Clair)
- Objective: Defeat Clair in Blackthorn Gym.
- Team Composition:
    - XENON (Haunter): Main attacker. Goal Lv40+. Use Night Shade for fixed damage.
    - KIMCHI (Gloom): Support. Goal Lv40+. Use Sleep Powder.
    - CALCIFER (Typhlosion): Heavy hitter backup.
    - GNEISS (Graveler): Tank backup.
- Detailed Plan:
    1. Grind Xenon and Kimchi to Lv40 on Route 45.
    2. Ensure Xenon has full PP for Night Shade.
    3. Use Hypnosis/Sleep Powder to manage threats.
    4. Night Shade bypasses high special defense of Clair's Dragon-types.

# Training Progress (Route 45)
- Goal: Lv40 for Xenon and Kimchi.
- Strategy: Lead with Xenon (Amulet Coin). Exp. Share on Kimchi.
- Efficiency: Fly to Blackthorn and heal when Night Shade PP < 2.

# Pending Rematches / Gifts
- Arnie (Bug Catcher): Route 35. Rematch potential.
- Alan (Schoolboy): Route 36. Rematch potential.
- Chad (Schoolboy): Route 38. Rematch potential.

# Lessons Learned
- Haunter Mechanics: Grounded in Gen 2 (no Levitate); extremely weak to Magnitude (Ground).
- Battle Strategy (Route 45): Switch to GNEISS (Graveler) immediately if Magnitude/Ground moves are expected.
- Fly Map: 2D snapping grid. Move cursor carefully; verify destination text before pressing A.
- Menu Navigation: Use `press_menu_buttons`. Check cursor position before batching A presses.
