# Current Strategy: Test Ledges & Return to Room 2
- **Location:** Silver Cave Item Rooms (3_77)
- **Status:** Testing ledges at Row 4 (x=4 to 9).
- **Hypothesis:** The Northern Item Rooms (via Warp 13,3) might be the EXIT. The ledges might be impassable from North, or I am missing the correct jump spot.
- **Alternative:** The ENTRANCE to the Southern Item Rooms is via Room 2 Warp (11, 5), which requires ascending the Western Waterfalls.
- **Plan:**
  1. Brute-force test ledges at x=4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
  2. If all fail, warp back to Room 2 (13, 3).
  3. Navigate to Western Waterfalls (Room 2, x=6, y=7).
  4. Solve the Surf/Waterfall ascent to reach Warp (11, 5).

# Key Findings
- **Item Rooms (3_77):**
  - **Layout:** North (Rows 1-3) vs South (Rows 5+). Row 4 is a barrier.
  - **Warp (13, 3):** Links to Room 2 (13, 21).
  - **Ledges:** Failed to jump at (6, 3) initially. Retrying with brute force.
- **Silver Cave Room 2 (3_75):**
  - **Western Path:** Corridor at Row 17 connects East/West. Leads to water at (6, 7).
  - **Objective:** Reach Warp (11, 5).

# Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Likely a one-way ledge. Direction (North->South) is under question.
