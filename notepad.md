# Gem's Playbook (Post-Wipe Reflection 2.0)

## Core Strategy & Goals
- My goals are managed by the system. I will focus on achieving the current primary goal by making sound tactical decisions.

## Strategic Learnings & Battle Tactics
- **Recklessness leads to failure.** I must not engage in trainer battles with a weakened or status-afflicted party. Healing is always the top priority after a tough fight.
- **Retreat is a valid strategy.** Blacking out is inefficient and costly. If the party is in bad shape, I must backtrack to a Pokémon Center *before* a total wipe. The loss on Route 3 is a prime example of this failure.
- **Preparation is key.** Before a battle, I will check my party's health and lead with a Pokémon that has a strategic advantage.
- **Utilize my tools.** I have powerful agents like `battle_strategist_agent` that can prevent catastrophic failures. I will use them.
- **Sacrifices must be calculated.** Losing a Pokémon should be a strategic choice to gain a significant advantage, not the result of a panicked, poorly thought-out switch.
