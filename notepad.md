# I. The Old Amber Investigation
- **Objective:** Retrieve the Old Amber from the Pewter Museum of Science.
- **Status:** In progress.
- **Confirmed Puzzle Steps:** 1. Lead with a fossil Pokémon, speak to Old Man (1F). 2. Speak to Scientist (2F) to get 'space exhibit' clue. 3. Interact with Space Shuttle Exhibit (2F). 4. (Hypothesis) Interact with Kabutops Fossil (1F).
- **Untested Hypotheses:** Lead with a Pokémon holding a 'Nugget' or lead with a Porygon and speak to the Gambler NPC.

# II. Core Directives & Lessons Learned
- **IMMEDIATE DATA & TOOL MAINTENANCE (CRITICAL):** As an LLM, my thinking is not continuous. All maintenance tasks (tool creation/fixing, agent definition, notepad updates) are the absolute highest priority and **MUST** be performed successfully in the current turn. Deferring tasks is an invalid strategy.
- **TRUST YOUR TOOLS & AGENTS (CRITICAL):** I must trust my tool and agent outputs as the default assumption. Before debugging, I must first verify my own position and assumptions against the game state.
- **MAP MARKER DISCIPLINE (CRITICAL):** I must mark every warp tile (both entry and exit) with '🚪' and every defeated trainer with '☠️' immediately.
- **HYPOTHESIS VETTING (CRITICAL):** Before attempting to test a hypothesis, I must first confirm it is mechanically possible within the game's established rules.

# III. Game Mechanics & Tile Types (Observed)
- **Post-Battle Position Shift:** Player may be moved after a wild battle.
- **Ghost-type Damage:** Ghost-type moves deal SPECIAL damage.
- **Purified Zone:** A healing area in Pokémon Tower (5F).
- **Inventory Access Bug (Confirmed):** With 21+ unique item stacks, 'ITEM' from the Start Menu opens the HM pocket.
- **Celadon City Fly Anomaly:** Using HM Fly from anywhere within Celadon City teleports the player to the Celadon Department Store entrance.
- **Fee Trigger Tile:** A tile that prompts for an entrance fee, even if already inside. Paying a second time broke a scripted loop.

### Tile Traversal Rules (Comprehensive)
- `ground` / `grass`: Standard walkable tiles.
- `impassable`: Walls, objects, NPCs, etc. Cannot be entered.
- `ledge`: One-way traversal. Can be jumped down from above (Y-1).
- `cuttable`: Tree that can be cut with HM Cut. Respawns on map change.
- `water`: Crossable using HM Surf.
- `spinner_*`: Forces movement. The `automated_path_navigator` can model paths that utilize these tiles.
- `spinner_stop`: A tile that halts movement from a spinner.
- `teleport` / `hole` / `ladder_*`: Instant warp tiles.
- `2x1/1x2 Warp Tiles`: Requires a two-step activation (stand on tile, press into boundary).
- `Two-Step Elevator`: Special warp (interact with panel, step onto adjacent warp).
- `steps`: Allows movement between `ground` and `elevated_ground`.
- `boulder_barrier` / `boulder_switch`: Switch that clears a barrier when a boulder is pushed onto it.
- `gate_*`: Gates that can block paths.

# IV. Completed Quests
- The Ghost of Lavender Town
- The Copycat's Gift
- The Sleeping Snorlax
- Cerulean City Investigation
- Silph Co. Investigation
- Rocket Hideout Investigation

# V. Development Pipeline
- **Agent Idea:** `inventory_manager` - analyzes inventory and suggests items to deposit to avoid the 21+ item bug.
- **Agent Idea:** `team_builder` - suggests party compositions for specific challenges (e.g., a gym leader, a specific Pokemon type).

# VI. Puzzle Hypotheses (Generated by Agent)
- **Puzzle:** Old Amber Retrieval
- **Hypothesis 1 (Rank 1):** Speaking to the 'Old Man' NPC at (2, 5) will now result in him giving the Old Amber, following the completion of the previous puzzle sequence.
- **Hypothesis 2 (Rank 2):** Interact with 'AerodactylFossil' (3, 4), then speak to the 'Old Man' (2, 5).
- **Hypothesis 3 (Rank 3):** Interact with 'KabutopsFossil' (3, 7), then 'AerodactylFossil' (3, 4), then speak to the 'Old Man' (2, 5).
- **Hypothesis 4 (Rank 4):** Use a field move on the 'AerodactylFossil' (3, 4).
