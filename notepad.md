# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Location:** Route 28 (West End).
- **Status:** Battling Wild Rapidash.
- **Action:** Press A to advance battle intro.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Encountered Wild Rapidash (New Pokedex Entry!).

  3. Plan: Throw Ultra Ball at full HP (High catch rate, Lv 83 vs Lv 40 risk).
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Catch Rapidash.
  2. After battle, verify if House at (7, 3) is reachable from here (unlikely due to ledges).
  3. If not, backtrack and check Gatehouse or Silver Cave Outside again.
