# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Strategy: The Western Highway (X=2)
The northern plateau (14, 10) is accessible via the western coastal corridor. Central land routes are blocked by one-way ledges.

### Execution Plan
1. Western Access: Navigate to (4, 51) via the cleared rock path at (5, 29).
2. Coastal Highway: Walk north along X=2 to Row 12.
3. Trigger sighting: Walk east to (14, 10).

## Global Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Land (Traversable).
- WALL, BUOY, DOOR: Impassable.
- WATER: Requires Surf.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way North. Blocks DOWN movement (e.g., Row 50; 6-8, 34).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way South. Blocks NORTH movement (e.g., 10, 15).

## Battle Plan: Eusine
- Roster: Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25).
- Counter: Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion) - Flamethrower sweep.
- Backup: Gorp (Lv50 Snorlax) - Body Slam.
