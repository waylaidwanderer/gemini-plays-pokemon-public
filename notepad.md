# Suicune Quest Strategy: 'The Great Buoy Loop' (Final)
- Fact: The northern plateau (Suicune area) is isolated by a wall at Y=15. Landing at (14, 28) is still south of this wall.
- The only access is via the buoy loop to reach the northern water at Y<15.
- Verified Route (Water):
    1. Start at (14, 28) (Current). Walk to (14, 27) and Surf.
    2. Sail to (26, 10) (Gap 1).
    3. Sail to (22, 16) (Gap 2).
    4. Sail to (21, 16), then North to (21, 14).
    5. Sail West through (19, 14) (Gap 3) to (18, 14).
    6. Sail North to (18, 10), then West to land at (16, 10).
    7. Walk to Suicune at (7, 4).
- Preparation: Lead with XENON (Haunter). Use SUPER REPEL.
