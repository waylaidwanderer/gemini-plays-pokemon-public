# Strategy: Trigger Suicune Sighting (Started: Turn 51131)
- Objective: Reach (14, 10) on the northern coast.
- The Outer Sea Highway (Execution Plan):
  1. Walk to (23, 32).
  2. Use SURF at (23, 32) to enter the Outer Sea at (24, 32).
  3. Surf North to Row 8 (stay at X=27+ to bypass all buoy barriers).
  4. Surf West along Row 8 to X=14.
  5. Land at (14, 11) and walk to (14, 10).
- Battle Prep: Lead Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion).

# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard traversable tile.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable collision.
- WATER: Requires SURF.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way (South). Blocks North.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Terrace. Walk ONTO from South to climb. Blocks South from North. Hypothesis: Allows horizontal movement.
- ROCK (Object): Impassable until cleared with ROCK SMASH.

# Discoveries
- Inner Sea (X=12 pond) is enclosed by buoy walls at X=19 and X=18.
- Outer Sea (X=24+) is accessible via the gap at (24, 32).
- Row 51 is a continuous land highway connecting all corridors.
- Row 12 is a northern land highway (X=5 to X=16).
- Row 13 gap at X=8 is the key to reaching the northern section from the Western Corridor.
