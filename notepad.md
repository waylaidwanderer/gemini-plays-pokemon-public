# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) in Cianwood City to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The West Beach Land Route (Verified)
- Plan:
  1. Walk to (4, 51) via (18, 45) -> (18, 51). [IN PROGRESS]
  2. Walk North along X=4 to (4, 37).
  3. Walk West to (2, 37).
  4. Walk North along West Beach (X=2) to (2, 14).
  5. Walk East to (8, 14), then North to (8, 12).
  6. Walk East along Row 12 to (14, 12), then North to (14, 10).
- Status: At (19, 42). Repel active. Stunned NPCs 1, 2, 10.
- Reasoning: City is partitioned by vertical walls (X=5, X=9, X=11, X=17). Row 51 is the only identified land bridge from the east side to the west side. X=4 is a clear vertical corridor from Row 51 to Row 37. Row 37 provides access to the West Beach (X=0-2), which is the only vertical highway past the northern barriers (Row 30 cliff, Row 15 wall/ledge).

# Blocked Routes (Verified)
- Row 15: Solid line of WALL and LEDGE_HOP_DOWN from X=3 to X=17.
- City Walls: Vertical walls at X=5, X=9, X=11, X=17 block most horizontal movement.
- Row 30 Cliff: Impassable FLOOR_UP_WALL from X=4 to X=11.

# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard ground. Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Surf required.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable cliff face.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
