## Primary Goal Strategy: Defeat Falkner (Violet City)
- **Team Composition:**
  - Calcifer (Cyndaquil): Target Lv12 for Ember to handle Sprout Tower and potentially Falkner's Pidgey.
  - ROCKY (Onix) & GNEISS (Geodude): Primary counters for Falkner's Flying-type Pokémon.
- **Plan:**
  1. Complete Sprout Tower to obtain HM05 Flash and train the team.
  2. Ensure Rocky and Gneiss are healthy for the Gym battle.
  3. Use Rock-types to soak up Normal/Flying hits.

## Completed Areas
- **Route 30/31:** Defeated trainers, caught Geodude and Bellsprout.
- **Violet City:** Traded Bellsprout for Rocky (Onix).

## Lessons Learned
- **Object Collision:** NPCs and items are walls. Navigate around them.
- **Battle Menus:** Selecting NO for switching is faster if current Pokemon is fine.
- **Level Requirements:** Cyndaquil learns Ember at Lv12 in Crystal.
- **Tool Hygiene:** Always provide full moveset data to `battle_strategist_v2`.
