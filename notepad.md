# PC Storage (Box 1)
- Ravioli (KRABBY): Lv10 (Surf, Whirlpool)
- LAPIS (POLIWAG): Lv12 (Waterfall, Surf, Whirlpool)

# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Standard walkable ground.
- WATER: Traversable only via Surf.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- WALL: Impassable obstacle.
- DOOR: Warp point.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Ledge face. Impassable from all directions.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).

# Suicune Capture Strategy
- Lead: XENON (Haunter, Lv44).
- Move 1: Hypnosis (Sleep). Accuracy is key.
- Move 2: Night Shade (44 dmg). Suicune (Lv40) has ~120 HP. Use twice for Red health.
- Move 3: Dream Eater (100 power). Only works if Suicune is asleep.
- Item: Ultra Balls (32).
- Backup: GORP (Snorlax) as a tank. Calcifer (Typhlosion) is risky due to type disadvantage.

# Strategic Plan: The Great Outer Channel
- Start Turn: 48151.
- Step 1: Walk to East Coast Surf Point (19, 30) via Row 29. (Done)
- Step 2: Surf East to X=27, then North to Row 10. (In Progress)
- Step 3: Surf West through Gap 1 (26, 10) to (19, 11).
- Step 4: Land at (16, 11) on the North Plateau.
- Step 5: Reach (14, 10) to trigger Suicune sighting.
- Status: XENON leading, Ultra Balls ready.

# Lessons Learned
- Fly Navigation: Johto Fly menu is a linear list scrolled with Up/Down, not a 2D grid.
- Exploration: (11, 15) and (11, 14) are dead-end pockets blocked by walls at Row 14/15.
- Pathing: Cianwood city center is elevated; land routes to the west/north beaches are blocked by FLOOR_UP_WALL and WALL. Surf via the east coast is the primary route.
- Pathing Failure: Attempting to walk from city center to West Beach (X=2) failed due to undetected FLOOR_UP_WALL tiles at Row 34/48.
