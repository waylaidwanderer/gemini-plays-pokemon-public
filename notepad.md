# Quest: Legendary Hunt
- Target: Suicune (Tin Tower)
- Lore: Three nameless Pokemon perished in the Brass Tower fire. Ho-Oh resurrected them as Suicune, Entei, and Raikou.
- Requirements: Clear Bell (Owned), 16 Badges (Owned).
- Plan:
    1. Release Beasts (Burned Tower) - DONE.
    2. Defeat Wise Trio (EcruteakTinTowerEntrance 4_1).
    3. Battle Suicune (Tin Tower).

# Strategy: Suicune Capture (Battle Analyst Advice)
- Lead: XENON (Haunter, Lv 44).
- Move 1: Hypnosis (Priority).
- Move 2: Night Shade (Fixed 44 dmg). Use exactly 3 times to put Lv 40 Suicune in red.
- Tank: GORP (Snorlax, Lv 50) for high Sp.Def.
- Backup: KIMCHI (Gloom) for Sleep Powder or Stun Spore (permanent paralysis if sleep fails).
- Items: Ultra Balls (32).

# Observations: Wise Trio
- Location: EcruteakTinTowerEntrance (4_1).
- Members: Sage GAKU (7, 10), Sage MASA (6, 9), Sage KOJI (5, 8).
- Progress: Sage at (4, 6) granted passage. KOJI at (5, 8) mentions Suicune but hasn't battled.
- Next Step: Interact with all Trio members in 4_1.

# Pokemon Movesets
- XENON (Haunter): Hypnosis, Confuse Ray, Night Shade, Dream Eater.
- Calcifer (Typhlosion): Flamethrower, Return, Smokescreen, Thunderpunch.
- KIMCHI (Gloom): Flash, Petal Dance, Cut, Sleep Powder.
- GNEISS (Graveler): Earthquake, Defense Curl, Strength, Rollout.
- GORP (Snorlax): Surf, Rest, Body Slam, Rollout.
- ICARUS (Pidgeotto): Fly, Sand-Attack, Gust, Quick Attack.

# Lessons Learned: Event Triggers
- Sage dialogue like "The TIN TOWER shook!" indicates an event progression. If they don't battle immediately, try interacting with all members of the group or standing on specific tiles nearby.
- Map 4_2 (WiseTriosRoom) might be a post-battle destination or related to Ho-Oh later. Focus on 4_1 for the Trio battle.
