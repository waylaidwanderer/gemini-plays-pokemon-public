## Reflection (Turn 33175)
- **Execution:** Currently performing manual menu navigation to switch Muscle to lead. Deferring creation of complex menuing tools due to state tracking complexity.
- **Hygiene:** Notepad is up-to-date. Map markers for defeated E4 members (Will) are placed.
- **Goal:** Defeat Koga. Muscle (Fighting) is the key sweeper.
- **Mistakes:** Previously failed to switch party due to tool assumption (menu state). Now proceeding manually to ensure accuracy.
