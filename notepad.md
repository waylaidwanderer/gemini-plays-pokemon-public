# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Strategy & Pathing
- **Goal:** Reach Azalea Town (West of Route 33).
- **Current Task:** Defeat Hiker Anthony.
- **Current Task:** Defeat Hiker Anthony.
- **Battle Status:** Rocky (Onix) 16/28 HP.
- **Opponent:** Machop Lv11 (100% HP). Moves: Low Kick, Leer, Focus Energy.
- **Strategy:** BERRY STALL.
    - Low Kick deals ~11 dmg. Rocky has 16.
    - If I attack, I do ~15% dmg. I need 6+ hits.
    - I can't survive 6 turns of trading hits.
    - **Plan:** Use remaining BERRYs to keep HP > 11.
    - **Win Condition:** Machop uses Focus Energy or Misses. This buys a free turn to Attack/Screech without losing HP.
    - **Risk:** High Crit rate from Focus Energy later.
- **Inventory:** BERRY x2 left.
- **Mechanics:**
    - Speed: Onix (70) > Machop (35). I move first.
    - Def: Onix (160). Low Kick (50BP) is the main threat.

- **GARNET (Quilava)** Lv18 (FNT) | **TOPAZ (Sentret)** Lv4 | **EGG** | **UNAKITE (Unown)** Lv5 (FNT) | **ROCKY (Onix)** Lv10 (6/28 HP)
- **Map Notes:**
    - **Route 32:** North.
    - **Union Cave 1F:** Current. Exit at (17, 31).
    - **Route 33:** South.
- **Mechanics:**
    - **Gen 2 Battle:** Items consume turn.
    - **Low Kick:** 50 BP * 1.5 STAB * 2 Type = 150 Eff BP. Onix Def reduces it significantly but 14HP is critical range.
