# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL / WINDOW: Impassable.
- LADDER: Two-way warp.
- PIT: One-way warp to floor below.

# Lessons Learned
- Ecruteak Gym Path: (3,9)->(3,7)->(6,7)->(6,5)->(7,5)->Martha; (6,5)->(5,5)->(5,1)->Morty.
- Moomoo Farm: Sick Miltank needs 7 standard BERRY items.
- Section Connectivity: 4F sections connected by gaps at y=2/3 (East-Middle) and y=14 (Middle-West).
- Warp Verification: (16, 7) and (17, 7) on 4F are map transitions (walk RIGHT to trigger).
- Descent Strategy: Use pits to quickly reach lower floors.

# Berry Knowledge
- Mint (R39), Bitter (R31), Mystery (R35), Ice (R36).
- Strategy: Fly to New Bark Town after finding Jasmine. Check trees R29-R32.

# Trainer Progress (Olivine Lighthouse)
- Defeated: Alfred (2F), Huey (2F), Theo (3F), Preston (3F), Kent (4F), Connie (4F), Terrell (3F Middle), Ernest (5F).
- To Battle: Ronald (5F North).

# Map Notes
- 3F Middle: Reachable via 4F pits (8,3)/(9,3).
- 5F Warps: (9,7) Ladder to 4F Middle, (9,15) Ladder to 6F.
- 4F Warps: (9,7) Ladder to 5F South, (9,5) Ladder to 5F North. (16, 7)/(17, 7) may be balcony exits. (13, 3) leads to 3F East.

# Swarm Events
