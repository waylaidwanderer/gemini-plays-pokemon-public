# Strategic Notes
## Objectives
- **Primary:** Reach Indigo Plateau (Money Farming Loop).
- **Secondary:** Defeat Elite Four.
- **Tertiary:** Hunt Roamers (Raikou/Entei) - *Paused*.

## Current Task: Traverse Victory Road 1F (South -> East)
- **Location:** Victory Road 1F (West Section) at (7, 55).
- **Goal:** Reach East Section via South Corridor.
- **Route:** `(7, 55) -> (7, 54) -> (15, 54) -> (15, 56) -> (18, 56) -> North`.
- **Reasoning:**
  - Navigating South Corridor (Row 54/56) to cross to East side.
  - Avoiding potential blockage at (6, 56) by using Row 54.
  - Heading to (18, 56) to begin Northern ascent to Ladder (17, 33).

## Reflection (Turn 32967)
- **Execution:** No deferred tasks identified in the last 50 turns.
- **Hygiene:** Notepad sections are relevant. Map markers are active and accurate.
- **Tools:** Current navigation challenges are due to map topology (vertical stacking), not tool deficiency. Standard `navigate` is sufficient with manual warp handling.
- **Goals:** Primary goal (Indigo Plateau) remains valid. Strategy shifted from 2F West (blocked/bugged ledge) to 1F Southeast (exploration).
- **Lesson:** Victory Road (3_91) is a single map with stacked floors. Navigation tools see it as one continuous area but cannot pathfind through warps automatically. I must manually step off and onto ladders to transition between floors.
- **Plan:** Trigger warp at (1, 35) to return to 1F, then traverse the southern corridor to the East section.
