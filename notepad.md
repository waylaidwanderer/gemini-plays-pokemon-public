# Suicune Quest Strategy (Crystal Version)
## Status & Progress
- **Key Items:** Clear Bell (Acquired)
- **Sightings:**
  - Cianwood City: Confirmed
  - Route 42: Pending (Target: Middle area near Mt. Mortar/Apricorn trees)
  - Route 36: Pending (Target: Near the Sudowoodo spot/Ruins of Alph)
- **Current Objective:** Trigger Suicune sighting on Route 36. The Wise Trio will only battle on Tin Tower 1F (3_4) once all sightings are complete.

## Capture Strategy (Tin Tower)
- **Lead:** XENON (Gastly) Lv21.
- **Moves:** Hypnosis (sleep), Night Shade (fixed damage).
- **Items:** 43 Great Balls, 1 Ultra Ball.
- **Note:** Suicune is a static encounter in Tin Tower and does NOT flee. Mean Look is not required.

## Battle Strategy (Wise Trio)
- **Lead:** GNEISS (Graveler) Lv44.
- **Moves:** Earthquake, Rollout.

## Hypotheses for Sightings
1. **Route 42:** Trigger is near the Mt. Mortar entrance (26, 15) or the Apricorn trees.
2. **Route 36:** Trigger is near the Sudowoodo spot (35, 9) or the Ruins of Alph entrance.

## Tile Mechanics - Global
- **FLOOR**: Walkable.
- **WALL**: Impassable.
- **WATER**: Surf required.
- **WARP_CARPET**: Map transition.
- **HEADBUTT_TREE**: Can be headbutted.
- **CUT_TREE**: Can be cut.

## Reflection (Turn 27299)
- **Skepticism:** The tracker claims the Wise Trio is defeated, but the lore dialogue suggests they are waiting for sighting requirements. I will prioritize Route 36 sighting.
- **Efficiency:** Exit gatehouse south to reach Route 36 quickly.
