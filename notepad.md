- **Current Position:** `(3, 2)`.
- **Immediate Goal:** Navigate East to `(11, 1)` to check for Boulder 3.
- **Bag Status:** Full.

    - Boulder 1: Not found at (18, 12), (17, 7).
    - Boulder 2: Not found at (5, 6).
    - Boulder 3: Not found at (11, 5).
    - Boulder 4: Not found at (9, 10). Re-checking (9, 10) as previous 'wall' was likely a wild battle.
    - NW Corner (0-6, 0-6): Checked, Empty.
    - SE Corner: Checked, Empty.
    - NE Corner: Checked.
- Goal: Locate boulders and push to pits.
    - Plan:
    1. Navigate North to (5, 7) to check for Boulder 2 near Pit (4, 7).

    3. Navigate to (5, 13) to check for Boulder 4 near Pit (5, 12).
- Note: Pits are open. Boulders MUST be somewhere. Maybe hidden in narrow corridors?
- Pits: `(11, 2)`, `(4, 7)`, `(5, 12)`, `(12, 13)` (Open).
