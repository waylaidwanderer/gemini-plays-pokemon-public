# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Stop Team Rocket.
- **Secondary Goal:** Find Team Rocket Uniform.
- **Tertiary Goal:** Solve Dept Store Basement Puzzle.
- **Navigation:** Interact with Machop (7,7), then navigate to South end (Row 13) to access the East side.

## Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR:** Standard walkable tile.
- **WALL:** Impassable collision.
- **COUNTER:** Impassable, interactable from adjacent tile.
- **LADDER:** Warp to another map/floor.
- **WARP CARPET:** Transition to adjacent map (usually at edges).
- **BOXES:** Dynamic wall tiles in the basement; likely moved by NPCs.

## Key Information
- **Radio Tower:** Entrance at (33, 9) in Goldenrod. Blocked by a Rocket Grunt who demands a Uniform.
- **Underground:** 
    - "No Entry" door at (18, 6) requires a key or switch.
    - Super Nerd at (19, 27) warned of rough battles.
- **Dept Store Basement:**
    - Black Belt at (4, 8) says: "won't work if someone's watching. Come on, kid, scoot!"
    - Machops and moving boxes present.
    - Items and a Ladder visible on the right side.

## Active Quests/Leads
- **Uniform:** Needed to enter Radio Tower. Likely in the Underground or with a specific NPC.
- **Basement Puzzle:** The workers (Black Belts/Machops) are moving boxes. I need to find a way to make them open the path to the items/ladder.
    - Hypothesis 1: Interact with them to trigger movement.
    - Hypothesis 2: Leave the area or hide to let them work (based on dialogue).
    - Plan: Check Machop at (7,7), then check Black Belt at (7,13).
## Reflections (Turn 12156)
- **Execution:** Good. No deferred tasks.
- **Hygiene:** Notepad cleaned. Markers updated.
- **Goals:** Clear.
- **Puzzle:** The basement has moving crates. Machops might move them. Talking to the Machoke at (7,7) didn't seem to move the crates immediately adjacent to it. I need to investigate further.
- **Hypothesis:** Black Belts might control the Machops or give instructions.
- Observation: Dept Store B1F contains Machops and crates. Looks like a warehouse area.
- Hypothesis: The ladder at (17, 2) might lead to the restricted section of the Underground (behind the locked door).
- Navigation: To reach the east side (Ladder), I must pass through the gap in the central wall at (12, 8).
- Observation: Boxes in the basement are moving (FLOOR <-> WALL changes detected). This is a dynamic puzzle involving the Machops.
- Observation: Black Belt at (9, 10) is moving up and down. I need to get closer to talk to him.
- Plan: Interact with Machop at (7, 7) to see if it moves boxes. Then, if needed, take the long route via the bottom-right (13, 14) and top-left (1, 1) to reach the ladder.
