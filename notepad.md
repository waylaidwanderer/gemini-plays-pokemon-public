# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Timestamp:** Turn 25496 (Jan 6, 2026)
- **Primary Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Immediate Task:** Reach the Northwest area of Silver Cave Outside.
- **Current Status:** At (29, 30), preparing to head East to the "Exit" area.
- **Hypothesis:** Access to the bottom path (Row 35) is via x=39. Tile (39, 32) is likely a Ledge Down that connects the Exit area to the Bottom Loop.
- **Route (Double Loop):**
    1. Navigate to (39, 31) (Route 28 Exit area).
    2. Attempt to walk Down at (39, 31) to jump the ledge at (39, 32).
    3. If successful, walk South to Row 35 and Loop West to x=1.
    4. If unsuccessful, exit to Route 28 and look for another path.

# Tile Mechanics & Observations
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT:** Standard one-way jumpable tiles.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Inconsistent behavior observed.
    - **Confirmed Ledge:** (39, 32) allowed jumping South.
    - **Confirmed Wall:** (6, 30) and (28, 34) blocked movement South.
    - **Strategy:** Treat as WALL unless verified otherwise.
- **Navigation Notes:**
    - The "Central" area (x=5) connects to the West path via Row 22 (re-verified via Mental Map).
    - Row 30 acts as a hard barrier across most of the map, separating the North and South sections.

# Key Locations
- **Mt. Silver Cave Entrance:** (18, 11)
- **Pokemon Center:** (23, 19)
- **Route 28 Exit:** (39, 31)
