# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Challenge the Pokémon League.
- **Secondary:** Traverse Victory Road.
- **Tertiary:** Train team for Victory Road.
- **Immediate:** Navigate Route 26 North.

# Current Status (Turn 18904)
- **Location:** Victory Road 1F (3_91).
- **Party:** Gyarados (76/111), Muscle (Lv61).
- **Recent:** Explored 2F West (Item Loop). Returned to 1F.
- **Goal:** Reach Victory Road Gate (Exit).

# Exploration Log
- **1F West:** Dead end (ledges).
- **1F Central:** Blocked by elevated terrain.
- **2F West:** Accessed via ladder at (1, 49). Contained HP Up. Loop leads back to ladder.
- **Current Plan:** Navigate from 1F West (current loc) back to Entrance area (9, 67), then explore Southeast corner (x=12+) to find path to 2F East.

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Obstacle. Requires HM06 + Badge.
- **Water Moves:** Special in Gen 2. Gyarados uses Sp.Atk for Surf/Waterfall.
- **Warp Carpets:** Directional exits.
- **LADDER tiles:** Bridges on Route 27; vertical transport in Victory Road.
- **Encounter:** Wild Rhydon at (9, 66). Fled successfully.
- **Exploration:** Confirmed (12, 68) is impassable (Wall). Southern strip inaccessible from here.
- **Strategy:** Backtracking to the Eastern Corridor (x=18) via (11, 54) to inspect the east wall (x=19) for hidden paths or missed ladders.
- **Exploration:** Checked East corridor. Dead end at (19, 52).
- **Strategy:** Returning to Ladder at (1, 49) to ascend to 2F West.
- **Encounter:** Wild Onix at (15, 56). Fled successfully.
- **Strategy:** Resuming navigation to Ladder at (1, 49) to ascend to 2F West.
- **Status:** Returned to 1F West (1, 49).
- **Analysis:** 2F West was a dead-end loop with an item.
- **Strategy:** Navigate to 1F East Corridor (x=18) via the central junction at (11, 54).
- **Goal:** Explore North of (18, 51) in the East Corridor, suspecting a missed ladder to 2F East.
- **Encounter:** Wild Graveler at (3, 51). Fled successfully.
- **Strategy:** Resuming navigation to 1F East Corridor (x=18).
- **Path:** Loop South to (3, 56), East to (15, 56), then North to (18, 51).
- **Goal:** Explore North of (18, 51) for missed ladder.
- **Status:** 2F West (current location) is a dead end/landing area.
- **Analysis:** The 2F West area is isolated by ledges. The ladder at (1, 35) is the only exit.
- **Strategy:** Descend ladder at (1, 35) to return to 1F.
- **Next:** Navigate to 1F East Corridor (x=18). Go NORTH from (18, 51) into the unexplored area to find the path to 2F East.
- **Correction:** 1F East (around 18, 51) is a dead end.
- **Realization:** 2F East is accessible from the 2F West Ladder (1, 35). I previously reached (11, 40) on 2F but turned back after getting the HP Up.
- **Strategy:** Return to Ladder at (1, 49) on 1F. Take it to 2F. Navigate to 2F East (x > 10) and explore North/East for the exit ladder.
- **Encounter:** Wild Onix at (11, 39).
