- **Achievement:** **CHAMPION OF THE JOHTO LEAGUE!**
- **Date:** Turn 33314
- **MVP:** Muscle (Machoke) Lv88.

# Reflection (Turn 35564)
- **Menu Hygiene:** "Macro" sequences with `sleep` are safer, but visual confirmation is best. "Intermediate States" can be confusing; trust "Current Screen Text".
- **Economics:** Super Repel (500g/200steps = 2.5g/step) is more efficient than Max Repel (700g/250steps = 2.8g/step). Prioritize Super Repels.
- **Status:** Turn 35569 - Wrong Clerk (Medicine). Canceling menu. Moving Down to (11, 6) to talk to the bottom Clerk (Balls/Repels).
- **Goal:** Buy Super Repels (preferred) or Max Repels.

# Roamer Hunt Log
- **Session Start:** Turn 34090.
- **Goal:** Catch Raikou/Entei.
- **Current Phase:** Restocking Repels at Goldenrod Dept Store 2F.
- **Strategy:** Buy Repels -> Fly/Teleport to randomize -> Hunt.

# Lessons Learned
- **Menu Navigation:** Inputs can be eaten by animations. Pace them.
- **Roamer Mechanics:** Fly randomizes.
- **Mart Stock:** Ecruteak has no Repels. Goldenrod 2F has them.
