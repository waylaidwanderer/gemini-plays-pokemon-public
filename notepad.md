# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Reach the Dragon Shrine via the East Whirlpool.

# Current Status (Turn 18309)
- **Location:** Dragon's Den B1F (26, 22).
- **Action:** Test interaction with Eastern Buoys/Whirlpools.
- **Reasoning:** 
    - Interactions with (24, 23) and (25, 23) failed. 
    - "Can't use that here" message suggests those specific tiles might not be valid Whirlpool targets, or "Buoy" tiles are unbreakable barriers.
    - Testing (26, 23) [Down] and (27, 22) [Right] to be thorough.
    - If these fail, the "Southern Barrier" hypothesis is likely false, and I must explore North for a different path.
- **Sequence:**
  1. Move to (26, 22).
  2. Face Down (26, 23), Interact.
  3. Face Right (27, 22), Interact.

# Plan
1. Test (26, 23) and (27, 22).
2. If successful, proceed.
3. If fails, Navigate North to explore the channel and look for a gap in the barrier or another path.

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Obstacle. Requires HM06 + Badge.
- **Buoy:** Possibly unbreakable barrier. Need to verify if *any* in this group are breakable.

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Requires HM06 Whirlpool + Glacier Badge. 
- **Lava/Magma:** (None here).
- **Ice:** (None here).

# Lessons
- **Menu Navigation:** Always verify cursor position before committing to a sequence. Blind input leads to wrong menus (e.g., PACK instead of POKEMON).
