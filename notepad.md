# Suicune Quest
- Objective: Trigger sighting in Cianwood City at the northern shore.
- Primary Strategy: The Great Northern Sea Loop (Verified)
    1. Walk to (19, 30) and Surf.
    2. Surf East to (27, 30), then North to (27, 10).
    3. Surf West to (23, 10), then North to (23, 8).
    4. Surf West through the gap at (22, 8) to reach (19, 8).
    5. Surf South to (19, 11), then West to (16, 11) and land.
    6. Walk West along Row 11 to (7, 11), then North to (7, 4).
- Note: Land routes are blocked by internal walls and impassable ledges (verified at (6, 34), (12, 50), (23, 46)). The sea loop is the only confirmed path.
- Suicune sighting count = 1.

# Tile Mechanics (Cianwood)
- FLOOR: Standard walkable ground.
- WATER: Traversable only while Surfing.
- WALL / FLOOR_UP_WALL / LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: All act as IMPASSABLE obstacles from the north.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- Interaction: Surf from FLOOR adjacent to WATER by pressing A.

# Confirmed Sea Gaps
- X=27: Clear north-south channel from Row 30 to Row 0.
- Row 10: Clear east-west channel from X=27 to X=23.
- Row 8: Clear east-west channel from X=23 to X=19.

# Lessons Learned
- Cianwood ledges are traps; do not attempt to jump them from the north.
- Internal walls divide the city into vertical strips; use the sea loop to bypass them.
- Always verify path traversability before committing to long sequences.
