# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Strategy: Finding Rock Smash
The northern plateau (14, 10) is blocked by boulders. I need TM08 Rock Smash to proceed. 

### Action Plan
1. Locate and talk to the NPC standing outside near the northern rock clusters (Row 16-27) to obtain TM08. (Highest Priority)
2. Teach Rock Smash to GNEISS (Graveler) or GORP (Snorlax).
3. Clear boulders at (8, 16) or (10, 27) and reach Suicune.

## Verified Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way ledge (South). Impassable from the North.
- ROCK: Impassable without Rock Smash.
