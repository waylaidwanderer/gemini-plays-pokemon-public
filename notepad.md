# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Stop Team Rocket.
- **Secondary Goal:** Investigate Radio Tower (Team Rocket takeover).
- **Navigation:** Go to Radio Tower (Northwest Goldenrod).
- **Status:** Investigating Northeast Goldenrod (Unknown Warp).
- **Plan:**
    1. Check Unknown Warp at (33, 9).
    2. Verify what Rocket Grunt at (31, 10) is blocking.
    3. If no progress, enter Underground via North Entrance (9, 5) and search Warehouse for Uniform.

## Key Information
- **Turn 12001:** Rocket Grunt at (31, 10) is a non-battling blocker.
- **Underground:** "No Entry" door at (18, 6) requires a key or switch.
- **Radio Tower:** Rumored to be taken over.

## Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR:** Standard walkable tile.
- **WALL:** Impassable.
- **COUNTER:** Impassable, interactable from adjacent.
- **LADDER:** Warp.

## Reflections (Turn 12001)
- **Execution:** Good immediate responses.
- **Hygiene:** Notepad cleaned up. Grunt behavior noted.
- **Goals:** Clear outcome-focused goals.
- **Hypothesis:** Uniform is needed. If not on a Grunt, maybe it's in the locked room or with a specific NPC I missed.
