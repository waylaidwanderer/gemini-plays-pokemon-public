### Strategic Reflection (Turn 8719)
- **Status**: Stuck in Goldenrod for ~100 turns.
- **Issue**: Oscillating between East/West without clearing the "fog of war".
- **Insight**: The North-East (Flower Shop) is a cul-de-sac. The Central North Wall seems solid. The only remaining option is the North-West quadrant, which is largely "unseen".
- **Action Plan**: 
    1. Return to Main Street (y=10).
    2. Move West to x=6.
    3.Systematically explore North from there, hugging the West edge.

### Navigation Notes
- **Location**: Route 35 Gatehouse (Goldenrod Side).
- **Goal**: Exit North to Route 35.
- **Status**: Inside the Gatehouse at (15, 7) of Goldenrod.
- **Guard**: Present at (2, 4).
- **Previous Info**: Investigated a gatehouse at (29, 8) earlier. This might be a secondary entrance or the main one.

### Map Structure
- **South Exit**: Leads to Goldenrod City Main Street (y=7).
- **North Exit**: Likely Route 35.

### Quest Chain: SquirtBottle
1. **Defeat Whitney**: Done.
2. **Find Floria**: Check Route 36 (North of Route 35).
3. **Get Bottle**: Return to Flower Shop.
