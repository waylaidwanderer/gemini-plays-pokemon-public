# Current Strategy: Return to Red
- **Timestamp:** Turn 26329 (Jan 7, 2026) [Silver Cave Room 2]
- **Primary Goal:** Defeat Red.
- **Status:** At West Landing (5, 21). Heading back to Item Rooms.
- **Plan:**
  1. Surf East to Central Landing (11, 25).
  2. Enter Warp at (13, 21) to Item Rooms.
  3. In Item Rooms: Go North to Row 0 (Hallway) to bypass internal walls.
  4. Access West Room (Max Revive) and East Room (Exit).

# Lessons Learned
- **Map Awareness:** Always inspect the full map (especially edges like Row 0) for peripheral paths before declaring a dead end.

# Tile Mechanics
- **WARP_CARPET_DOWN:** Must step DOWN onto this tile to trigger warp.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** South-facing Ledge. Blocks North movement.
- **Waterfall:** Slide-back unless facing UP + Press A.

# Map Notes
- **Route 28:** Path leads West to Silver Cave.
- **Silver Cave Item Rooms:**
  - Warp (13, 3) connects to Room 2.
  - North Hallway (Row 0) connects East/West sides.
- **Silver Cave Room 2:**
  - West Landing (5, 21) is empty/dead end.
  - Right side (Row 16) is a one-way ledge drop.
- Trap Analysis: Foyer (Cols 4-15) is completely enclosed.
  - North (Row 1) is a solid WALL. Cannot reach Hallway (Row 0).
  - West (Col 3) and East (Col 16) are WALLS.
  - South (Row 4) is the ONLY exit via Ledges.
- Ledge Testing:
  - Blocked: 4, 5, 6, 12, 14.
  - Testing: 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15.
- Action: Moving to (7, 3) to test (7, 4).
