# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard ground. Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Surf required. Traversable.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- DOOR: Warp point.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable cliff face. Blocks movement from either side (e.g., at 6, 34 blocks South).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
- BREAKABLE ROCK: Requires Rock Smash. Impassable.
- NPC: Impassable. Interact from adjacent tile.

# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The 'Ghost' Channel Bypass (Verified)
- Plan:
  1. Surf at (12, 28) into (12, 27). [IN PROGRESS]
  2. Navigate to (16, 15) via X=15 corridor (Clear of buoys).
  3. Land at (16, 14) (FLOOR).
  4. Walk to (14, 10) (All FLOOR).
- Status: At (12, 28), facing water.
- Reasoning: Direct land access is blocked by cliff walls (FLOOR_UP_WALL) at Row 34 and Row 30. The buoy maze is a distraction; a clear water corridor exists at X=15 that leads directly to a northern landing spot at (16, 14).
