# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement. Passable from SOUTH to NORTH. Found at (4, 20), (16, 10), (8, 34), (6, 46), (8, 48), (9, 48), (10, 48), (12, 50).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at (10, 15).
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- Start Turn: 49771
- Start Time: 3:29 PM

## Strategy: The Row 22 Bypass
1. Navigate North along X=12 to (12, 28). (Completed)
2. Use Surf at (12, 28) to enter the central pool. (Completed)
3. Navigate North via sea to (12, 22). (In Progress)
4. Navigate West through the gap at (3, 22) to the Western Corridor (X=0-2).
5. Navigate North through the corridor to (2, 12).
6. Navigate East along Row 12 to (14, 12).
7. Navigate North to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

## Hypotheses
- H1: The Western Corridor (X=0-2) is a continuous path from Row 26 to Row 14. (Partially verified by Mental Map).
- H2: (14, 10) is the trigger point for the Suicune sighting. (Marked in Mental Map).
- H3: Row 12 is walkable from X=8 to X=14.

# Progress Notes
- Reached (9, 44) on Turn 49779.
- Note: Out of Repels. No wild encounters on land in city.
- Failed Strategy: Southern Loop (Turn 49774-49776) - Too many ledges and dead ends.
- Failed Strategy: X=5 Gap at Row 35 - Unreachable from the North due to FLOOR_UP_WALL at Row 34.
