## Strategy for Lance (Champion)
- Gyarados: DEFEATED
- Aerodactyl: DEFEATED
- Dragonite #1: DEFEATED
- Dragonite #2: DEFEATED
- Charizard (Fire/Flying): ACTIVE. Strategy: GNEISS (4x Rock advantage) or Calcifer (Thunderpunch).

## Persistence Knowledge
### Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- LADDER: Traversable.
- WARP_CARPET: Walking off map edge triggers transition.

### Lessons Learned
- Gengar (Ghost): Immune to Normal moves (Return).
- Dragonite/Charizard (Ghost interaction): XENON is immune to Normal moves (Hyper Beam/Slash).
- Party Sub-menu Order (Battle): SWITCH, STATS, CANCEL.
- Party Sub-menu Order (Overworld): STATS, SWITCH, ITEM, CANCEL.
- HM Sub-menu logic: HM moves appear at top. SWITCH is 3rd if 1 HM known.

## Battle Strategy
- Use fodder to safely Revive key members (XENON, GNEISS).
- XENON uses Hypnosis to disable threats.
- GNEISS (Rollout) is the backup for Charizard if XENON fails.
- Current Status: ICARUS, Ouroboros, XENON, LAPIS fainted. Calcifer (31 HP, PAR) and GNEISS (35 HP) remaining.
- Goal: Secure a knockout on Charizard with GNEISS or Calcifer.
## Battle with Lance (Cont.)
- Lance Challenge Start: Turn 37500.
- Strategy Update: Calcifer is paralyzed and low HP. Plan is to let him faint, then use a Revive to restore him to 50% HP and clear status. This is more efficient than using multiple turns to heal him with berries.
- Lesson: Level advantage is negated by paralysis (75% speed reduction). Priority is clearing status for the speed tier.
