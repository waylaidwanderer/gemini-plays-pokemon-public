# Blackthorn Gym 1F - Battle with Clair
- Current Turn: 35185

## Battle Strategy: Gym Leader Clair
- Opponent: Leader Clair
- Pokémon 1: Dragonair (Lv37). Moves: Thunder Wave, Surf. (FAINTED)
- Pokémon 2: Kingdra (Lv40). Moves: Surf.
- Status: Xenon fainted. Calcifer fainted (Turn 35185).
- Strategy: Calcifer fainted to Kingdra's Surf. Immediate priority is to revive Calcifer using a Revive. I will send out Gneiss as a pivot/shield to use the item. Gneiss is 4x weak to Water, so this is risky, but his high level (48) gives him the best raw stats to potentially survive a non-water move or at least buy a turn.
- Note: Kingdra is Water/Dragon. Weak only to Dragon-type moves in Gen 2. Electric/Grass are neutral due to Water typing.
