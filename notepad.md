# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Investigate Team Rocket Hideout.
- **Secondary Goal:** Access B3F Boss Room (NW Corner).
- **Status:**
    - Passwords "SLOWPOKETAIL" and "RATICATE TAIL" obtained.
    - B2F Locked Doors (14,12 & 15,12) require Executive/Murkrow (Transmitter Room).
    - B3F Boss Room is walled off from the East/South.
    - B2F West is split by a wall at Row 12. Northern part (with Item Ball) is unreachable from South.
- **Hypothesis:** A hidden path (stairs/hole/trap) exists in the B1F North-West corner (x=1-5, y=1-5) leading to B2F North-West.

## Team Rocket Hideout Status
- **B1F:** Security disabled. Trap Warp at (5,15).
- **B2F:** Lance met. West Ladder (3,14) connects to B1F.
- **B3F:** Boss Room locked. Grunt at (5,14) blocks bookshelf (likely Oath).

## Tile Mechanics
- **Trap Tiles:** B1F corridors (Geodude/Voltorb/Koffing).
- **Security Cameras:** Trigger alarms/battles.
- **Locked Doors:** Require specific triggers (Passwords or Key Items).

## Action Log & Reflection
- **Status:** In B3F West Corridor (3,6). Just looted TM46 from B2F NW.
- **Fact:** B2F NW (Item Room) is a dead end accessed via B3F West.
- **Plan:** Backtrack: Ladder (3,2) -> B2F North -> B3F NE -> B3F Main.
- **Objective:** Locate and open the Boss Room Door at B3F (10,9) using the two passwords.
