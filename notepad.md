# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement. Passable from SOUTH to NORTH. Found at (10, 48), (12, 50), (16, 10).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. One-way ledge jumping South. Found at (10, 15).
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- Start Turn: 49771
- Start Time: 3:29 PM

## Strategy: The True Sea Route (Final)
The plateau (X=13-16, Row 10-14) is accessible by landing on its eastern edge (X=16) from the water.
1. Surf Down from (27, 8) to (27, 16). (Passes Row 9 gap at X=27).
2. Surf West to (19, 16). (Passes X=26 gap at Row 16, X=22 gap at Row 16).
3. Surf Up to (19, 11).
4. Surf West to (17, 11) and land at (16, 11).
5. Walk West to (14, 11), then North to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

# Progress Notes
- Verified: Land route is a maze of one-way ledges blocking Southward travel.
- Verified: Buoy maze has specific gaps at (27, 9), (26, 16), (22, 16), and (18, 11).
- Note: Out of Repels. Running from wild encounters.
- Hypothesis: (16, 11) is a valid landing point for the plateau.
- Turn 49826: Wild Tentacruel battle at (24, 16). Running.

# Reflection Turn (49823)
- Immediate Execution: Executing the "True Sea Route". This path utilizes verified buoy gaps to navigate the sea barriers and reach the plateau's eastern shore.
- Error Analysis: Previous failures were due to misidentifying buoy gaps and the directional nature of city ledges.
- Stagnation Check: This is the definitive route; proceeding with high confidence.
