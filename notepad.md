# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Active Strategy: The True Sea Route
The city's internal walls and one-way ledges block land access. The buoy lines at X=18 and X=19 have a gap at Row 26.

1. Surf South along X=28 to (28, 26). (In Progress)
2. Surf West along Row 26 to (17, 26).
3. Surf North along X=17 to (17, 16).
4. Surf West and land at (13, 16).
5. Walk North to (11, 14) (bypassing Row 15 wall).
6. Walk East and North to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune sighting.

## Verified Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement (Confirmed at Row 46, Row 48, Row 50).
- Buoy Gap: Row 26, X=17-19 is a confirmed passage under the vertical buoy walls.
- Plateau Landing: (13, 16) is a valid landing point for the northern plateau.
