# Suicune Quest
- Objective: Trigger sighting in Cianwood City at northern shore.
- Strategy: The Southern Promenade (Verified Land Route)
    1. Surf back to (19, 30) and land.
    2. Walk South along X=19 to (19, 51).
    3. Walk West along Row 51 to (4, 51).
    4. Walk North along X=4 to (4, 44).
    5. Walk West along Row 44 to (2, 44).
    6. Walk North along X=2 corridor to Row 4.
    7. Walk East along Row 4 to (7, 4) to trigger sighting.
- Note: The Sea Loop is blocked by buoy walls at Row 15 and Row 9. The land route via Row 51 is the only confirmed way to the west side.
- Suicune sighting count = 1.

# Tile Mechanics (Cianwood)
- FLOOR: Standard walkable ground.
- WATER: Traversable only while Surfing.
- WALL / FLOOR_UP_WALL / LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: All act as IMPASSABLE obstacles from the north.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- Interaction: Surf from FLOOR adjacent to WATER by pressing A.

# Confirmed Corridors
- X=19: Clear from Row 30 to Row 51.
- Row 51: Clear from X=4 to X=23.
- X=4: Clear from Row 44 to Row 51.
- Row 44: Clear from X=2 to X=23.
- X=2: Clear from Row 4 to Row 49.

# Lessons Learned
- Cianwood ledges are impassable from the north. Do not attempt to jump them.
- Internal walls divide the city into vertical strips; use Row 51 to move between them.
- Always reveal tiles manually before planning long-distance routes.
