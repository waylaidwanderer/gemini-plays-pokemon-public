# Strategy: The Suicune Pursuit
- **Objective:** Trigger Suicune sighting at (14, 10) in northern Cianwood.
- **Eusine Battle Prep:** Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25). Strategy: Lead with Lv64 Calcifer. Sweep with Flamethrower/Thunderpunch.
- **Current Plan (The Sea Bypass):**
  1. Surf at (28, 44).
  2. Surf North to Row 6, then West to X=21 (bypassing Row 9/15 buoy hooks).
  3. Surf South to Row 10, then West to land at (15, 10).
  4. Walk to (14, 10) for the sighting.
- **Verification:** Row 6 is clear of buoys at X=21-27. Landing spot (15, 10) is FLOOR.
- **Land Route Failures:** X=2/4 blocked by Row 23 wall. X=6/12 blocked by Row 15 wall. Southern loop blocked by Row 46/48/50 Terrace Climbs.

# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Standard traversable terrain.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable terrain.
- WATER: Traversable only with Surf.
- DOOR / WARP_CARPET: Map transition points.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump down (South). Blocks North.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL (Terrace Climb): One-way barrier. Allows North movement, blocks South.
- ROCK (Object): Blocks movement; cleared with Rock Smash. Respawns upon map transition.

# Area Notes: Cianwood City
- **Barriers:** Row 15 is a solid wall/buoy barrier from X=3 to X=22, EXCEPT for a gap at (11, 15). Row 13 is solid at X=11, making (11, 15) a dead end.
- **Shortcut Tiles:** (5, 29), (4, 25) (Smashed Rocks).
- **Terrace Climbs:** (4, 30), (6, 34), (6, 46), (21, 46), (8, 48), (12, 50). All block South movement.

# Lessons Learned
- **Time Check:** Attempting sighting since Turn #50620.
- **Verification:** X=2 corridor confirmed clear of Terrace Climbs and Ledges in Mental Map.
