# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Inland Gap Crossing)
- Start Turn: 48430
- Step 1: Walk to (12, 32) and then West to (8, 32) (Gap in Wall 1 at X=11/9).
- Step 2: Walk to (8, 35) and then West to (2, 35) (Gap in Wall 2 at X=5).
- Step 3: Walk North along West Beach (X=2) to Row 12.
- Step 4: Walk East to (15, 12) and then North to Suicune's spot at (14, 10).
- Hypothesis: The buoy maze is a distraction; the plateau is reachable via the west beach.
