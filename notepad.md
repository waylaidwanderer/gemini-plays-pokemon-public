# Area Mechanics & Strategy
## Strategy for Rising Badge (Gym Leader Clair)
- Status: Gym trainers defeated. Boulders pushed into pits.
- Opponent: Clair uses Dragon-type Pokemon (Dragonair, Kingdra).
- Strategy:
  - GNEISS (Lv48): Physical damage.
  - XENON (Lv36): Night Shade and Hypnosis (固定 damage and control).
  - CALCIFER (Lv49): Thunderpunch for coverage vs Kingdra.
- Blocked Unseen: (14, 61-62). (Hypothesis: Reachable from the strip starting at x=14-15 at the top of Route 45).

# Exploration Log
- Items: Max Potion at (7, 33), Mysteryberry from (16, 82).
- Trainers: All trainers in middle/right strips defeated (Kenji, Michael, Timothy, Erik, etc.).
- Basin Hypothesis: All southern strips end in basins or exits. Strip 1 (x=0-2) ends at y=81 (Warp to R46). Strip 2-4 (x=4-11) ends at y=87. Strip 5 (x=12-17) ends at y=83.
- Strategy: RESET COMPLETE. Navigating eastern Blackthorn corridor to reach Route 45 eastern strip.
- Corridor Path: (32, 27) -> (32, 25) -> (39, 25) -> (39, 31) -> (31, 31) -> (31, 33) -> (27, 33) -> (27, 35) -> (17, 35).
- Barrier Check: Row 32 (x=21-29) and Row 34 (x=15-19, 29-31) are walls from the North. Gap at Row 32 is x=30-31. Gap at Row 34 is x=20-27.
- Target: Eastern strip entrance of Route 45 (x=15-18) on Row 35. (Updated Turn 33958).

# Lessons Learned
- **Ghost Lead:** Haunter lead is ideal for wild Graveler encounters (Selfdestruct immunity).
- **Strips & Ledges:** Route 45 is a one-way system of vertical strips. Exit to Route 46 is in the leftmost strip (x=0-2).
- **Basin Navigation:** Some strips are connected at specific latitudes (e.g., y=83 connects middle and right strips).
- **Blackthorn Zigzag:** A wall at Row 32 blocks column 21-29. Use the gap at column 16-17. A wall at Row 34 blocks column 15-19. Use the gap at column 20-21.
- **Menu Verification:** Always check the current screen before executing long button sequences to avoid logic loops.

# Exploration Strategy (Blackthorn/Route 45)
- Tiered City: Row 21/23/28/30/32/34 contain one-way ledges/walls.
- Northward Gaps: (9, 21), (19, 21), (33, 21) are FLOOR tiles in the ledge line.
- Goal: Reach eastern Route 45 (Strip 5, x=16-17).
- Current Position: (24, 29). Heading to (33, 21) to reach upper tier.
- Plan: Once on upper tier, explore NE Blackthorn for an exit to Strip 5.
- Backup: Search Route 45 for eastern transitions (e.g. Ledge Hop Right). (Turn 33964).
