# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Navigate to the Dragon Shrine (Go around the whirlpool).

# Correction: Badge Mechanics (Turn 18208)
- **Fact:** I DO have the Glacier Badge (Pryce).
- **Mechanic:** Glacier Badge enables Whirlpool. Rising Badge (Clair) enables Waterfall.
- **Conclusion:** I CAN use Whirlpool. Previous failures were due to "Facing Up" glitches.
- **Plan:**
  1. Use Surf.
  2. Navigate to the Eastern Whirlpool at (24, 23).
  3. Use Whirlpool to cross the barrier.
  4. Land on the Southern platform to reach the Shrine.

# Status & Plan (Turn 18206)
