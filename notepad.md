# Ice Path Strategy
- **Current Action:** Navigating East Corridor Northbound.
- **Goal:** Find Ladder to B1F in the East area (x>20).
- **Path Plan:**
  1. From (28, 18), Walk East to (29, 18). [NEXT]
  2. Walk North along the corridor to (29, 14) and beyond.
  3. Look for branching paths to the East (towards items at x=31+).
- **Items:** Item Balls at (32, 23), (35, 9), (31, 7).

# Mechanics & Lessons
- **Ice Physics:** Sliding continues until collision.
- **Ledges:** `FLOOR_UP_WALL` tiles are impassable walls.

# Map Structure
- **West:** Entrance (Route 44).
- **Center:** Hub.
- **East:** Winding corridors leading deeper.
