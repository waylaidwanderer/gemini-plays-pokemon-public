# Suicune Quest (Crystal) - FIXED SIGHTINGS
- Milestone 1: Burned Tower (Seen).
- Milestone 2: Cianwood City (Seen). Defeated Eusine.
- Milestone 3: Route 42 (In Progress). Pokedex confirms location.
- Milestone 4: Route 36 (Next). Requirement: Complete Route 42 sighting.
- Milestone 5: Tin Tower (Final). Requirement: Clear Bell (OBTAINED) + all overworld sightings.

## Suicune Hunt Strategy
- Suicune is NOT a roamer in grass until after the Tin Tower event.
- Route 42 Trigger: Approach the island center. Approach from the WEST via Surf is the current hypothesis.
- Route 36: Enter from the Violet City side (East) after Route 42 is completed.

## Suicune Trigger Hypothesis Testing (Route 42)
- Hypothesis 21: Systematic floor sweep (Y=10-17) failed. No trigger on any FLOOR tile. [Turns 17654-17664]
- Hypothesis 22: Trigger requires approaching the island from the WEST bank via SURF. [Starting Turn 17671]

# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL / FRUIT_TREE / COUNTER / HEADBUTT_TREE: Impassable.
- TALL_GRASS: Traversable, triggers wild encounters.
- WATER: Impassable without Surf.
- LEDGE: One-way movement (South-only for standard).
- WARP / DOOR / WARP_CARPET: Map transition.
- CUT_TREE: Impassable until CUT.
- ROCK: Impassable. Requires ROCK SMASH.
- VOID: Impassable map boundary.
- CAVE: Warp tile to interior.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable floor edge.

# PC Storage (Box 1)
- VORTEX (Poliwag 22), INTERCEPT (Yanma 12), ROCKY (Onix 6), EGG (CleFFA 5), XFDW (Meowth 16), FRITTATA (Togepi 5), SHUCKIE (Shuckle 15), Blarney (Sudowoodo 20).

# Items & Contacts
- Fire Stone: Route 36 (Alan).
- Rock Smash (Info): Route 36 (Fisher at 44, 9).
- Fisher Tully: Route 42. Gives items.
- Bug Catcher Arnie: Route 35. Reports Yanma swarms.

## Progress Log
- Turn 17654: Initiated systematic island floor sweep.
- Turn 17664: Finished sweep. No trigger.
- Turn 17671: Pivoting to approach island from the west via Surf.
