# Mechanics
- **Battle Cursor:** Remembers last move used.
- **Fly Map:** Visual Map (Cursor based). Use D-pad to select city. **Cursor persists:** Always verify "Currently selected destination" text before confirming flight.
- **Pokegear Map:** Visual. Roaming Beasts appear as icon.
- **Menu Memory:** Start Menu and Pokegear cursors remember their last position. Always verify state.

# Strategic Status
- **Goal:** Register Raikou & Entei.
- **Current Task:** Hunt Roaming Beasts (Phase 2).
- **Location:** Route 38 (West of Ecruteak).
- **Action:** Hunt Loop: Transition between Rt 38 and Gatehouse.
- **Hunt Progress:** Phase 2 Loop 1/50. Started Turn 40029.
- **Beast Status:** Checking Route 38.
- **Hunt Strategy:**
    1. Check Pokegear on Route 38.
    2. If Beast is present: Max Repel -> Grass -> Search.
    3. If not: Enter Gatehouse -> Return to Route 38.
    4. Repeat.

# Past Attempts
- **Phase 1 (Rt 37):** 75 loops. 0 Encounters. Failed.

# Strategy (Encounter)
- **Raikou/Entei:** Flee immediately.
- **Plan:** Sleep (Gengar/Haunter/Butterfree if available, currently have none? Check Party).
- **Party Check:**
  - Gyarados (Lead, Intimidate might lower attack but they flee).
  - Machoke.
  - Oddish (Status fodder).
  - Quilava.
  - Lugia (Tank).
  - Pidgey.
  - **Correction:** I don't have a reliable sleeper in the party. Oddish is Lv 5.
  - **Note:** Roamers retain damage. Hitting them hard is better than nothing if I can't sleep them.
  - **Master Ball:** I don't have one? Check Inventory. No Master Ball listed.
  - **Action:** Just hit them for now. Track HP.

# Resources
- **Money:** ¥15644.
- **Items:** Max Repel x30.
- **Key Items:** Pass (Magnet Train).
- **Status:** Roamers on Rt 42, 32, 30. None on 38.
- **Next Step:** Close Gear -> Return to Gatehouse (Reset).
- **Note:** Walking back to Gatehouse to reset loop.
- **Lesson:** Gatehouse warps can be sticky. Automate resets to avoid 'doorway effect'.
