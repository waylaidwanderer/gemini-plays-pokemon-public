# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Challenge the Pokémon League.
- **Secondary:** Obtain Extremespeed Dratini (Dragon's Den).
- **Tertiary:** Get Master Ball (New Bark Town).
- **Immediate:** Deposit a Pokemon at Blackthorn PC.

# Current Status (Turn 18410)
- **Location:** Dragon's Den 1F (3, 3).
- **Action:** Interacting with Ladder at (3, 3).
- **Reasoning:** 
    - Detected a warp loop: 1F(3,3) -> 1F(5,13) -> 1F(3,3).
    - Previous entry (Turn 17918) successfully went 1F(3,3) -> B1F(20,3).
    - Suspect the "warp" to (5,13) might be a misunderstanding or a specific state.
    - Trying to explicitly "Use" the ladder (A button) to enter B1F.
- **Goal:** Reach B1F, then Shrine.

# Plan
1. Press A on Ladder.
2. If warp to B1F, proceed to Shrine.
3. If warp to (5, 13), explore (5, 15) or other options.
4. Get Dratini.

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Obstacle. Requires HM06 + Badge.
- **Buoy:** Obstacle.
- **Lava/Magma:** (None here).
- **Ice:** (None here).
- **Warp Carpets:** Some (like Dragon's Den 1F exit) may be arrival-only or directional.

# Lessons
- **Menu Navigation:** Always verify cursor position.
- **Map Reading:** Verify tile types (Buoy vs Whirlpool).
- **Warps:** If a warp doesn't trigger, try different approach angles or assume it's one-way.
