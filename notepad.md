# Suicune Quest Strategy (Crystal)
- Status: ROAMING (Post-Tin Tower battle).
- Current Location (Pokedex): Route 37 (Turn 19218).
- Strategy: Boundary cycling between Ecruteak City and Route 37.
- Lead: XENON (Gastly Lv21) with Mean Look and Hypnosis.

# Capture Prep & Funding
- Strategy: Mean Look -> Hypnosis -> Chip away HP (if safe) -> Throw Balls.
- Level Gap: Suicune (Lv40) vs XENON (Lv21). XENON needs levels, but can still use Mean Look if it survives Turn 1.

- Funds: ¥2373.
- Note: Max Revive and Full Restore are in inventory for the battle.

1. Move to (17, 35) in Ecruteak City.
2. Step south to Route 37.
3. Check Pokedex.
4. If Suicune is on Route 37, search grass.
5. If not, step north to Ecruteak City and repeat.

# Immediate Strategy (Turn 19221)

- Ecruteak Mart lacks Ultra Balls. Focus on capture with existing resources or find better Mart later.
- Roaming tracking is active. Boundary cycling is the most efficient method.
