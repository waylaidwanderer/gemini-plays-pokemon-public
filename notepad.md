# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Deliver Kenya to Route 31.
- **Secondary Goal:** Travel to Mahogany Town (Route 42).
- **Tertiary Goal:** Train Party to Level 30+.
- **Immediate Action:** Finish Mail & Deliver.
  1. **Current State:** Mail text "DARK CAVE leads to another road" typed.
  2. **Action:** Press `Start` (Shortcut to END) -> `A` (Confirm).
  3. **Next Step:** Talk to Fisher at (17, 7) immediately.
  4. **Expectation:** He accepts the mail.
  5. **Contingency:** If he rejects it AGAIN, the text might be case-sensitive (try Title Case?) or he is the wrong NPC (Check Gatehouse).
- **Route Info:** Route 31.
- **Mail Status:** Message "DARK CAVE leads to another road" ready.

## Party Status

- **Webster's Mail:** Delivering Kenya (Spearow) to Route 31. Recipient is the Sleeping Man (Cooltrainer) near Dark Cave.
- **Gyms:** 6 Badges. Next: Mahogany (Glacier).

## Mechanics Notes
- **Fly Map:** Navigation is list-based via `Up`/`Down`. Order: New Bark -> Cherrygrove -> Violet -> Azalea -> Goldenrod.
- **Menu Cursor:** Remember position! Always reset or verify.

### Reflection (Turn 8681)
- **Execution:** Addressed "Cursor Memory" issues by resetting via Start Menu. Debugged Fly Map navigation step-by-step.
- **Notepad:** Cleaned up obsolete typing logs. Recorded Fly Map list logic.
- **Lesson:** When blind inputs fail, STOP and verify with screen text. Do not assume standard grid navigation.
