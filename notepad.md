# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Cross the whirlpool to reach the Dragon Shrine.

# Key Mechanics & Lessons
- **Field Moves:** If 'A' interaction fails (even when facing correctly), ALWAYS fallback to Menu -> Pokemon -> [Mon] -> [Move].
- **Whirlpool:** Requires facing the whirlpool tile directly. 'A' button might be unreliable; Menu is safer.

- Status: Correction - Closing Menu & Facing Down (Again).
- Reason: Game State shows 'Facing: Up'. My previous attempt to face Down (Turn 18037) likely failed due to input swallowing during menu exit.
- Step 1: Press 'B' to close the current menu.
- Step 2: Press 'Down' to face the whirlpool.
- Step 3: Press 'A' to interact.
