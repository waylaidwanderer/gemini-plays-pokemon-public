- **Goldenrod Underground (3_53):** Divided into isolated sections.
  - **Main Tunnel:** Top & West areas. Contains (3, 2) Ladder and (3, 34) Ladder.
  - **Southeast Room:** Isolated. Contains Ladder (22, 27) and Warp (21, 31).
  - **Connection:** Map 3_54 (Warehouse Entrance) connects the Main Tunnel (via 3, 2) and Southeast Room (via 22, 27).
- **Current Location:** Southeast Room (21, 31).
- **Escape Route:** Take Ladder (22, 27) -> Map 3_54 -> Walk to Northwest Ladder -> Main Tunnel (3, 2).
- **Goal:** Reach Southwest Ladder (3, 34) in Main Tunnel.

# Strategy
- **Puzzle Mechanic:** "Open one shutter, another closes."
- **Clue:** Grunt at (11, 4) said 'The switch on the end is the one to press first'.
- **Result:** Switch 1 OFF opened the West Shutter at (10, 5).
- **Current Status:** Accessing NW area.
- **Plan:** Find Switch 3 (likely "the switch on the end") in the NW corner. Press it first. Then find Switch 2.

# Important Locations
- **Switch 1:** Map 3_54 (ON).
- **Locked Door:** At (18, 6) in Main Tunnel. **Verified as One-Way EXIT.**
- **Switch Room Entrance:** Ladder at (3, 34).

# Completed Notes (Archive)
- **Dept Store Puzzle:** Solved. Blue Barrier blocks path.
- **Rival Battle:** Defeated Silver.
- **Blockage:** Path South blocked by solid wall at Row 10 (x=11-21).
- **Hypothesis:** Switch 1 opened Row 7, but Row 10 remains closed. Need to find another switch or mechanism.
- **Plan:**
  1. Pick up item (Might be key?).
  2. Inspect "Emergency Switch" location at (20, 11) via (20, 10).
  3. Explore corners of North Room (Row 5) for missed switches.
- **Puzzle Mechanic:** "Open one shutter, another closes." Switch 1 ON opens South path (Row 7) but seems to close West path (Row 5/Col 10).
- **Hypothesis:** Turning Switch 1 OFF might open the Top Path (Row 3) or the West Shutter, allowing access to the NW area.
- **Current Block:** Tile (10, 5) is impassable.
- **Next Step:** Battle Grunt at (11, 4). Then try turning Switch 1 OFF to access the West side via Row 3.
- **Clue:** Grunt at (11, 4) said 'The switch on the end is the one to press first'.
- **Plan Update:** Grunt didn't move. Assuming static. Returning to Switch 1 to turn it OFF. Expectation: West Shutter (10, 5) will OPEN.
