# Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Reach Blackthorn City via Ice Path.

# Ice Path Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Reach Blackthorn City.
- **Status:** At (13, 17). Start of Ice Puzzle.
- **Ledge Mystery:** `FLOOR_UP_WALL` tiles at (20, 24) and (7, 18) blocked movement. I suspect they are South-facing ledges, but my jump attempts failed. I will try one more time at (14, 22) with precise inputs.
- **Plan A (South):** Solve Ice Puzzle to reach (14, 22) and jump.
  - Path: Right -> Down -> Left -> Down (slide) -> Down (jump).
- **Plan B (North-East):** If South fails, re-explore the North-East loop (Row 12).
  - Investigating (25, 11) and potential ledge/ladder access.
- **Items:** Item Balls at (32, 23) and (35, 9).

# Key Log
- **Turn 16364:** Failed to move West. Reset to (13, 17).
- **Turn 16361:** Hallucinated jumping ledge at (14, 22). Reality: Stuck at (14, 21).
- **Turn 16342:** Reached dead end at (25, 12).
- **Turn 16328:** Entered Ice Path.

# Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR:** Walkable.
- **WALL:** Impassable.
- **WATER:** Surfable.
- **HEADBUTT_TREE:** Interactable/Obstacle.

# Key Log
- **Turn 16261:** Surfing on Route 44 (35,9).
- **Turn 16240:** Defeated Psychic Phil.
- **Turn 16222:** Confirmed Suicune not in Pokedex.
- **Route 44 Update:** North/East bank of 2nd lake (Zach's island) is a DEAD END (Ledges block Eastward travel).
- **Correction:** Path to Blackthorn must be via the South Path, accessible from the 1st lake (likely landing South at x=27).
- **Next Step:** Backtrack to 1st lake and explore South bank.
- **Turn 16312:** Defeated Cooltrainer Cybil. Proceeding East on South Path to Blackthorn City.
- **Turn 16322:** Defeated Cooltrainer Allen at (37,15).
- **Turn 16327:** At (44,4). Path blocked by ledges. Looping South to (44,14) then East to (49,14) to use the gap.
- **Turn 16328:** Entered Ice Path 1F at (4,19).
- **Observation:** Spotted an Item Ball at (32, 23) in the eastern ice area, currently separated by a wall.
- **Observation:** Spotted another Item Ball at (35, 9) in the far North-East, currently unreachable from the low ground.
- **Correction:** The "South-East Path" was a dead end.
- **Hypothesis:** The way forward is likely jumping the ledge at (18, 24) to access the southern rows (25+).
