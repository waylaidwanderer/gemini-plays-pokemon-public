# Ice Path Strategy
- **Current State:** At Ice Path B1F (2, 14).
- **Goal:** Explore B1F West Corridor.
- **Observations:**
  - The ladder at (3, 15) leads to a dead end at (3, 13) (WALL).
  - The only way forward is West to the corridor at x=0-1.
  - Walls at (2, 10-13) and (3, 13) block direct access to the Pit area.
- **Plan:**
  1. Walk to (1, 14).
  2. Walk North along x=1 to explore the map.
  3. Look for a gap to the East to access the Pit area.

# Map Structure
- **B1F Room:** Divided into West Corridor (x=0-1) and East Room (x=3+).
- **1F:** Solved North Ice Room and East Ice Puzzle.
- **Item Ball (35, 9) on 1F:** Still uncollected. Likely needs B1F boulder puzzle solution.
