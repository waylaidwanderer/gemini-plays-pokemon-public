# Tile Mechanics
- **TALL_GRASS:** traversable, chance of wild encounter.
- **HEADBUTT_TREE:** solid (collision), chance of encounter if Headbutt is used.
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN:** one-way traversable (down only).
- **WALL:** impassable.
- **FLOOR:** traversable.

# Lessons Learned
- **Automation Limits:** Long macro tools crossing map boundaries are unreliable due to variable load times and interruptions (phone calls, repels). Use short, verifiable sequences instead.

# Strategic Status
- **Money:** ¥2294 (Need more for efficient hunting).
- **Shopping List:** Max Repel x20 (Goal).
- **Task Start:** Turn 39227 (Money Farming).
- **Goal:** Register Raikou & Entei.
- **Strategy:** Money Farm at E4 -> Buy Supplies -> Blind Hunt.
    - **Logic:** Tracking roamers from adjacent maps is futile because entering their map causes them to move. Thus, a blind encounter on entry is the only valid method.
    - Use Super/Max Repel with Lead Pokemon (Lv 36) < Roamer (Lv 40) but > Wild (Lv 17).
    - Loop: Enter Route 37 -> Scan Grass (20 steps) -> Exit to Ecruteak -> Repeat.
    - Do NOT check Pokegear map.
- **Repel Status:** None.
- **Session Start:** Turn 38471.
- **Active Events:** Bug-Catching Contest (Tuesday).
- **Roamer Logic:** Roamers move to an adjacent map when the player transitions maps. 'Blind Interception' relies on them moving *into* your map as you enter.
- **Detour:** Goldenrod Dept Store was a bust. No Super Repels.
- **New Plan:** Fly to Indigo Plateau. Beat E4 for cash. Buy Max Repels.
- **Mechanics Correction:** The 'POKEGEAR MAP' is for viewing only. To FLY, I must use the 'POKEMON' menu (Party -> Select Flyer -> Fly).
- **Action:** Exiting Pokegear and switching to Party Menu.
- **Sequence:** B (Exit Gear) -> Up x2 (Select Pokemon) -> A (Open Party).
- **Goal:** Access Pidgey (Slot 6) to Fly to Indigo Plateau.
