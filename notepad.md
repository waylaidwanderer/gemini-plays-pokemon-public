# Long Term Notes
## Lessons Learned
- **Tool Insight:** `navigate_menu` requires `hold_ms >= 300` for Fly Map movement.
- **Menu Safety:** Start Menu cursor remembers previous position (e.g., PACK). Always verify cursor before pressing A.
- **Efficiency:** Super Repels (2.5 ¥/step) > Max Repels (2.8 ¥/step).
- **Fly Map:** Vertical movement is safer.

## Legendary Beast Hunt Strategy
- **Target:** Raikou (#238) & Entei (#239).
- **Method:** Blind Hunt Loop (Route 37 <-> Ecruteak).
- **Tactics:** Rt 37 Grass -> Wiggle -> Return -> Repeat.

## Tile Mechanics
- GRASS: Traversable, encounters.
- FLOOR/DOOR/STAIRS: Traversable.
- WALL/OBSTACLES: Impassable.
- WATER: Surfable.

# Current Strategy
## Objectives
- **Primary:** Complete Pokedex.
- **Secondary:** Hunt Roaming Beasts.
- **Navigation:** Goldenrod City via Fly.

## Session Information
- **Current Location:** Silver Cave Outside.
- **Goal:** Fly to Goldenrod City (Dept Store) for Super Repels.
- **Status:** Handling Phone Call Interruption.
- **Method:** Press B repeatedly to clear Gaven's call -> Retry Fly.
- **Notes:** Gaven called just as I attempted to Fly. Must clear text before retrying. Cursor was at New Bark Town, sequence for Goldenrod (Left x3, Down) is correct for next attempt.
