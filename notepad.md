# Global Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard traversable tile.
- WALL / TREE / MOUNTAIN / HEADBUTT_TREE: Impassable collision.
- WATER: Requires Surf (HM03) to traverse. Interact with water edge or use from menu.
- CUT_TREE: Requires Cut (HM01) to clear. Impassable otherwise. Regrows whenever the map is reloaded (e.g., entering/exiting Mount Mortar).
- LEDGE: One-way jump (usually South). Cannot be jumped from below.
