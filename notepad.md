# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Active Strategy: The Southern Clearway Sprint
The northern plateau (14, 10) is only accessible via the Western Corridor (X=0-2). This corridor is blocked from the main city by a long North-South wall. I must reach the southern clearway at Row 51, which provides a land path to the corridor.

1. Walk to (9, 51) via Row 44 and X=9. (In Progress)
2. Walk West along Row 51 to (2, 51).
3. Walk North along X=2 to Row 12.
4. Walk East to (14, 12), then North to trigger Suicune at (14, 10).
