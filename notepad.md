# Lessons Learned
- Ecruteak Gym Path: (3,9)->(3,7)->(6,7)->(6,5)->(7,5)->Martha; (6,5)->(5,5)->(5,1)->Morty.
- Moomoo Farm: Sick Miltank needs 7 standard BERRY items.
- Section Connectivity: 4F sections connected by gaps at y=2/3 (East-Middle) and y=14 (Middle-West).
- Warp Verification: (16, 7) and (17, 7) on 4F are NOT map transitions; (18, 7) is a WALL.
- Descent Strategy: Use pits to quickly reach lower floors. 4F (16, 9)/(17, 9) are PITs to 3F.
