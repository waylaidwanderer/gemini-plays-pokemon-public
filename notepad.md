# I. Game Mechanics & World Knowledge

## A. Core Gameplay (Verified)
- **Battle Style:** Set mode.
- **Items in Battle:** Prohibited.
- **Level Caps:** Active and enforced.
- **PC Interaction:** To use a PC, stand on the tile directly *below* it and face *up* before pressing 'A'.
- **Menu Navigation:** The 'B' button is the primary method for exiting/canceling out of menus.
- **Forced Sleeping Switch:** The game will force you to send out or switch to a sleeping Pokémon if no other conscious Pokémon are available. This is a mechanical exception to the strategic guideline of avoiding switching to sleeping Pokémon.

## B. Tile Mechanics & Traversal (Verified & In-Progress)
- `ground` / `grass`: Standard traversable tiles.
- `impassable` / `unknown`: Cannot be entered. Must be navigated around.
- `water`: Requires Surf to traverse.
- `ledge`: Can be jumped down (from Y-1 to Y+2 in one step), but not climbed up. Impassable from below and sides.
- `steps`: Allows movement between `ground` and `elevated_ground`.
- `elevated_ground`: Walkable ground at a different elevation, only accessible from `steps` or other `elevated_ground` tiles. One-way drops to adjacent `ground` tiles are possible.
- `cleared_boulder_barrier`: Functions as a one-way ramp. Allows upward movement from an adjacent `ground` tile to the `cleared_bolder_barrier` tile (which acts as `elevated_ground`). Downward movement from `cleared_boulder_barrier` to `ground` is prohibited.
- `boulder_barrier`: Impassable tile that can be cleared by a `boulder_switch`.
- `boulder_switch`: Floor switch for boulders. Activating it changes `boulder_barrier` to `cleared_boulder_barrier`.
- `spinner_*`: Forces movement in the specified direction.
- `ladder_up` / `ladder_down`: Function as warps but are traversable tiles.
- `hole`: A tile that a boulder can be pushed into, usually causing it to fall to a lower floor. The player can also walk into the hole after the boulder.
- **Boulder Pushing:** When the player is standing on a tile directly next to the boulder, pushing it will move the boulder one tile, but the player's character remains stationary.
- **Defeated Trainers as Obstacles:** In high-level areas like Victory Road, some defeated trainers (e.g., Juggler at (22,14)) become impassable objects. However, others (e.g., Hiker at (13,10)) do not and can be passed through. This needs to be tested on a case-by-case basis.

# II. Battle Data & Strategy

## A. Type Effectiveness Chart (Verified In-Game)
- **Super Effective (2x):** Water > Rock, Ground, Fire; Electric > Water; Ground > Fire, Electric, Rock, Poison, Psychic (Hypothesized), Ground; Ice > Ground, Grass, Flying, Dragon; Flying > Fighting, Grass, Bug; Fighting > Normal, Rock, Ice; Grass > Ground, Rock, Water; Psychic > Ghost.
- **Not Very Effective (0.5x):** Normal !> Rock; Flying !> Rock; Ice !> Fighting (Ice-type moves are NOT super-effective against Fighting-types); Psychic !> Psychic.
- **Immune (0x):** Normal immune to Ghost; Ground immune to Electric; Flying immune to Ground; Ghost immune to Ground.

## B. Strategic Notes & Hypotheses
- **Opponent Coverage:** Always assume opponents, especially high-level ones like the Elite Four, have coverage moves for their weaknesses. Do not rely solely on primary typing for strategy.
- **Hypothesis (Agatha's Gengar):** A fast, high-level Psychic-type is essential. My Lv36 Kadabra was too underleveled. I need a faster solution or a bulkier Pokémon that can survive Gengar's attacks.

# III. Meta-Progression & Lessons Learned

## A. Core Methodological Failures (Self-Correction Log)
- **Violation of Immediate Action Mandate:** I have repeatedly failed to perform critical maintenance (e.g., fixing a failed tool) in the turn it was discovered, deferring it instead. This is a critical misunderstanding of my nature as an LLM. All necessary actions (tool fixes, agent definitions, notepad updates) MUST be performed in the current turn.
- **Flawed Hypothesis Testing (Confirmation Bias):** My process for discovering new game mechanics has been reactive and flawed. I must actively try to *falsify* my own hypotheses to avoid confirmation bias and verify tool outputs against manual observation.
- **Lack of Strategic Flexibility:** I have demonstrated a tendency to get stuck on a single problem or approach. If progress on an objective stalls, I must be more willing to pivot to a different task or adopt a more exploratory strategy.
