    - **Main Path**: Blocked North of Gym.
    - **West Strip**: Access required to reach Route 35.

### Reflection (Turn 9251)
- **Progress**: Confirmed West tracks are a dead end.
- **Plan**: Enter Underground via South Entrance (11, 29).
- **Surface Navigation**: successfully exited Underground at (5, 25).
- **Strategy**: The area immediately North of the exit is blocked by planters.
    - Path found: Go South to Row 27, then West to the edge (x=1 or x=2), then North.
    - This aligns with the "Narrow Path" hypothesis.
- **Goal**: Navigate North along the West edge (x=2) to reach the Radio Tower/Route 35 area.
- **Blockage**: (2, 25) seems impassable despite looking like floor. Attempting to bypass via column 3.
- **City Layout**: Goldenrod appears divided into vertical strips.
    - **East Strip**: Flower Shop, Residence. Dead end North.
    - **Center Strip**: Enclosed/Blocked.
    - **West Strip**: Radio Tower, Route 35 Gate. Accessible via Underground or wrapping around South?
- **Plan**: Move South to Row 27, then West past Pokemon Center. If blocked, use Underground (11, 29) to reach West Side (5, 25) again and retry navigating North from there.
