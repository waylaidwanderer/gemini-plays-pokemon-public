# Key Locations

- **Cooltrainer F:** (35, 19)
- **Sign (34, 24):** "Blackthorn City - A Quiet Mountain Retreat"
- Wade (Route 31) offered Berries.

# Blackthorn Gym Strategy
- Use Ice-type moves (Gyarados/Icy Wind, Sneasel, Swinub) against Dragons.
- Clear all trainers for XP.
- Navigate floor by floor.
- Current Target: Solve Boulder Puzzle (South-East).
- Defeated Cooltrainer F at (4, 11).
- Boulders located at (8, 14) and (6, 16).
- Strategy: The South Boulders (B3, B4) create a blockade. Access to their South side (to push them North) is blocked by walls and the boulders themselves.
- Hypothesis: There must be a "back door" to reach (6, 17) or (8, 17).
- Potential Back Doors: Ladder at (7, 9), or falling through Pit (2, 5).
- Action: Investigate Ladder at (7, 9).
- Boulder 1 (2, 3) is a simple Push South to Pit (2, 5).
- Puzzle Strategy: Avoid pushing boulders into dead ends. Ensure a path is clear before moving them.
- Combat Note: Dragonair uses Dragon Rage (Fixed 40 DMG). Use High HP Pokemon (Muscle) to tank.
- Gym 2F Layout: Left (Col 0-1) and Right (Col 5-9) separated by wall, connected at Row 1 (Top) and Row 13 (Bottom). Also crossing at (2, 9) -> (3, 9).
- Alternative Solution: North Boulders (2, 3) and (3, 3).
- Boulder 1 (2, 3) can be pushed South into Pit (2, 5).
- Access via column 1 from Ladder (1, 7).
- Gym 1F Observation: Row 5 is a wall blocking access to Clair from the entrance/ladder area. Must solve 2F puzzle to proceed.
- Navigation Note: 1F is divided by walls at Row 5. To reach Clair (North), must fall from 2F.
- Cooltrainer M at (6, 6) is reachable from the South (Row 12+).
- Observed: Tiles (7, 6) and (7, 7) are labeled as Warps but do not trigger when walked on. They are likely Drop Zones from 2F.
- Upcoming: Battling Cooltrainer M at (6, 6).
