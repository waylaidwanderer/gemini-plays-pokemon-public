# Strategy: The Suicune Pursuit
- **Quest Started:** Turn #50620
- **Current Plan:** Fly to Cianwood -> Smash boulders at (4, 19) and (8, 16) -> Reach Suicune sighting spot at (14, 10).

# Global Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL / BUOY / HEADBUTT_TREE: Impassable.
- WATER: Requires Surf.
- DOOR / WARP_CARPET: Warp point.
- STAIRCASE: Warp point (stairs/elevator).
- COUNTER: Impassable; interact from adjacent tile.
- SMASHABLE_ROCK (Object): Requires Rock Smash.

# Lessons Learned
- **Menu Navigation:** The "Switch items?" confirmation box is modal; B button does not close it. Use A on NO to exit.
- **Fly Map:** Starts at current town. Cursor moves smoothly. Relative positions: New Bark (East), Cherrygrove (West), Violet (North), Azalea (South), Goldenrod (West/North), Olivine (West), Cianwood (Far West).
- **Coordinates:** Notepad coordinates (e.g., Cianwood 14, 10) refer to the internal map grid, not the Fly Map cursor position.
- **Suicune Spot:** (14, 10) in Cianwood City. Requires Rock Smash at (4, 19) and (8, 16) to reach. [Hypothesis - Advisor]
