# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- PIT: Impassable. Falling into a pit warps the player to the floor below (1F).
- LADDER: Warp to the floor below (1F).
- BOULDER: Object. Can be pushed with Strength. Impassable.

# Blackthorn Gym Discovery
- The boulder puzzle is skippable! A clear path exists along the right side of the gym: (8, 7) -> (9, 7) -> (9, 3) -> (6, 3).
- I am currently standing at (6, 3) facing Clair at (5, 3).

# Battle Preparation: Clair
- Team Status: Calcifer (Lv47), Gneiss (Lv45) are the heavy hitters.
- Clair's Team (Expected): Dragonair x3, Kingdra.
- Strategy: Use Calcifer's Thunderpunch for coverage and Gneiss's Earthquake for raw power.
- Note: Be prepared for a long battle.

# Type Effectiveness (Verified)
- Fire -> Dragon: Not very effective.
- Water -> Dragon: Not very effective.
- Electric -> Dragon: Not very effective.
- Grass -> Dragon: Not very effective.
- Dragon -> Dragon: Super effective.
- Ice -> Dragon: Super effective.
- Ground -> Dragon: Neutral.
- Rock -> Dragon: Neutral.
- Normal -> Dragon: Neutral.

# Battle Log: Clair
- Turn 30303: Battle Start. Calcifer vs Dragonair (Lv37).

# General Lessons
- Puzzle Bypass: Always explore the perimeter of a room before committing to a complex puzzle. Many puzzles have non-obvious bypasses or simpler solutions than they first appear.
- Tile Verification: Explicitly test the collision of "lava" or "hazard" tiles; they may be standard floor tiles with a different sprite.
- Battle Strategy: High-level starters can often brute-force through type resistances with powerful neutral moves like Return.
