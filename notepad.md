<h1><code>Main</code></h1>

[Lessons Learned]
- Avoid over-mashing A during map transitions and battles. It causes UI desyncs, mistaken menu inputs, and turn hallucinations. Use targeted tools instead.
- Always carry Antidotes when exploring caves to prevent retreating from Poison damage.
- Map markers for defeated trainers (e.g. ☠️) should ONLY be placed AFTER returning to the overworld, never during a battle.
- If an item is not explicitly listed in the Game State Information sprite list, it DOES NOT EXIST.
- NEVER use dead reckoning. ALWAYS read the Game State Player Position before making any navigational assumptions.
- Gen 1 PC menus (DEPOSIT, WITHDRAW, etc.) retain cursor memory.
- Gen 1 Battle menus retain cursor memory! Reset the main menu cursor to FIGHT by pressing Up and Left before navigating.
- Gen 1 Move menu cursor memory is retained when switching Pokemon manually. It RESETS to index 1 when a Pokemon faints and a new one is sent out, or at the start of a NEW battle!
- The Game State Info inventory list is alphabetized, but the in-game bag is NOT. Do not rely on Game State indices to find items.
- The overworld Start Menu ALSO retains cursor memory! Always check where the cursor is before blindly executing navigation sequences.
- When menu state desyncs or cursor memory causes an error, ALWAYS back out entirely to the overworld (spam B) and start fresh. Do not try to "fix" it mid-menu blindly.

[HMs]
- HM01 (Cut): Taught to Audrey (Bellsprout).
- HM05 (Flash): Obtained! Tested party + Diglett, Dugtrio, Meowth, Voltorb - none can learn it. Abandoned finding a Flash user; navigating via grid is faster.

[Exploration Notes]
- NEVER assume a path is blocked based on visual patterns (like fences). ALWAYS physically test every tile along the suspected barrier by bumping into it to confirm if there is a hidden gap.
- Encountered Lv 30 Snorlax on Route 12. Failed to catch due to running out of Poke Balls. Defeating it to clear the path. Must stock up before the next static encounter!
- Custom tools cannot read the screen mid-execution (no while loops for visual feedback).
- Skull Bash is a 2-turn move (Turn 1: lowers head, Turn 2: attacks).
- Always visually confirm the item name under the cursor before pressing A in the item menu, as the bag is not alphabetized and indices change.
- The building at (22, 13) in Fuchsia City is NOT the Pokemon Center. It's a house with books.
- I must exclusively use short (1-3 step) movement sequences when navigating tight corridors with ledges and fences.
- WARNING: Cut bushes respawn if you walk too far away from them (off-screen reload)! Always re-verify if the path is actually open.

[Fuchsia City Layout]
- Ledges are strictly ONE-WAY. You can only jump DOWN (South) over them. Moving North against a ledge acts as a solid wall. Note: Not all TYPE_3fe2 tiles are ledges (many are just flat paths or grass), so rely on visual confirmation.
- The path West towards the Pokemon Center is blocked by a Cut bush at (18, 19). Y=13/14 paths are blocked by fences/buildings.
- To return North from the bottom of the city, you CANNOT go up the West side due to ledges. You must head East along the bottom (Y=27/29) to X=18, then head North and Cut the bush at (18, 19) to access the top half.
- Safari Zone Path: From the Cut bush at (18, 19), walk North. You cannot walk straight North at X=18 due to zoo fences at Y=7. Instead, walk West to X=16, walk North, use Cut on the bush at (16, 11), then continue North to Y=6, West to X=15 to dodge the sign, North to Y=4, East to X=18, and Up to enter.

[Gen 1 Mechanics]
- Cursor memory differences: Party menu from Start->POKéMON retains it, Start->ITEM->USE resets it. PC and Battle menus retain it. Move menu retains it when switching manually, but resets on faint/new battle. PokeMart SELL menu RESETS to the top after every sale!
- The Party Menu and Move Menu WRAP. Mashing 'Up' does not guarantee index 1.
- HALLUCINATION CHECK: Never assume a tile ID is a solid wall without physically testing it. In the Safari Zone, TYPE_fed7 and TYPE_3fe2 are BOTH passable tall grass! Thick solid bushes look distinctly different (dark green, round leaves). Always bump to verify!
- MACRO DANGER: Do not use alternating directional macros (like L-D-L-D) near ledges when searching for gaps. It can cause accidental ledge jumps, leading to false assumptions about solid walls. Always use step-by-step inputs for precise exploration.
- In the overworld, pressing a new direction takes one discrete input just to TURN without moving. When using move_sequence, always add an extra press for turning, or overshoot into walls to guarantee alignment!
- The Start Menu WRAPS! Mashing 'Up' does not guarantee index 1.
- run_battle tool works perfectly in the Safari Zone because the 2x2 menu layout maps identically to the standard battle menu.
- Safari Zone Attempt 4: Turn 20128
- NEVER assume a building's purpose based on interior floor tiles (e.g., checkered floors). Different buildings can share tilesets. Always rely on Game State Info (like the presence of a PC or Nurse Joy) to identify it.
- NEVER delete a verified, working path from notes just because you suspect a shortcut exists. Only update navigation notes AFTER empirically proving the new route works. Hallucinating gaps in solid walls (like Y=22 in Fuchsia) wastes dozens of turns.
- HALLUCINATION CHECK: If my current visual perception (e.g., seeing an Item Ball in a building) contradicts a previously written note (e.g., "This building is a trap Rest House"), I MUST trust my eyes and investigate the anomaly, rather than blindly following the note and ignoring the item. Notes can be poisoned by past false assumptions!

- TYPE_5519: Cut Tree (Can be removed by using HM01 Cut from the Pokémon menu while facing it).

<hr>

<h1><code>Mechanics/Combat</code></h1>

[Turn 62] Combat basics: Turn-based. Type matchups are critical (e.g. Water beats Fire, Grass beats Water). STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) applies for matching move and Pokémon types. Use FIGHT to attack, ITEM to use Potions.
- **Hydro (Squirtle)**: Learned Bubble (Water) at Level 8.
[Status Effects]
- Overworld Poison: Pokemon lose 1 HP every 4 steps in the overworld. Calculate exact step limit (Current HP * 4) to know exactly how far you can travel before panicking!
- **Menu Navigation:** In battle, if you accidentally enter the ITEM menu, you must press B to exit it, then press Up to move the cursor back to FIGHT, then A to select it. The `battle_move_selector` tool ONLY works when the cursor is already inside the FIGHT menu (showing the 4 moves). Do not mash B to back out of menus, as you might back out of the FIGHT menu entirely.
[Route 25 Enemies]
- Youngster's Lv 17 Slowpoke: Confusion deals 6-12 damage to Lv 25 Wartortle.
- Gym Leaders (e.g., Misty) actively use stat-boosting items like X Defend during battle. Plan for longer fights or bring counter-stat moves (like Tail Whip) if relying on physical damage.
- Risk Assessment: Always consider enemy speed and damage rolls. If your Pokemon is slower and can be KO'd by a high roll or crit (like Pidgey's Gust dealing 10+ damage to a 15 HP Nidoran), switch to a healthier/resistant Pokemon to secure split EXP rather than risking a faint.
- Gust is a Normal-type move in Generation 1, not Flying-type.
- Night Shade deals fixed damage equal to the user's level.

- Burn Heal (¥250)

<hr>

<h1><code>Mechanics/Battle_Gen1</code></h1>

- "But, it failed!" refers to the move just executed by the current Pokemon (e.g., an enemy's stat-dropping move failing because the stat can't go lower, or Gen 1 AI quirks). It does NOT mean the player's previous attack missed.
[Mechanics/Combat]
- Gen 1 battle menus WRAP AROUND (pressing Down at move 4 goes to move 1).
- Cursor position is remembered per Pokemon. Must accurately track current_move_index.
- The battle cursor RESETS to index 1 in two cases:
  1. At the start of a NEW BATTLE.
  2. After a Pokemon LEVELS UP.
- It is REMEMBERED between enemy Pokemon within the SAME battle (if no level up occurred).
[Cursor Memory]
- In Gen 1, menu cursor positions are remembered! The Item menu remembers the last used item position globally. The Fight menu remembers the last used move per-Pokemon. The Party menu remembers the last selected Pokemon. ALWAYS check the visual cursor position before using navigation tools, as assuming it resets to index 1 will cause wrong selections.
- Wrap/Bind Mechanic: In Gen 1, trapping moves like Wrap completely immobilize the target. The move selection phase is skipped entirely and you cannot attack until the effect ends. Do not try to use battle menus during Wrap.
- Wrap Mechanic: Wrap is a multi-turn trapping move in Generation 1. The attack continues automatically for several turns without needing new inputs. When the main battle menu (FIGHT/PKMN/ITEM/RUN) reappears, it signifies the trapping effect has concluded.
- `execute_battle_turn` tool selects FIGHT and a move index. It CANNOT switch Pokemon. To switch, use `switch_pokemon_in_battle` or manual menu navigation.

<h1><code>Mechanics/NPCBehavior</code></h1>

[Wandering NPCs]
- Wandering NPCs can step on and block warp tiles (like doors). If this happens, you must step back to give them space to wander off the tile before you can enter.
[Trainer Displacement]
- Trainers walk up to 1 tile towards you when they spot you.
- This can be exploited to move them out of blocking positions (e.g., to reach an item).
- Trainers have a line of sight. Stepping into it from a distance makes them walk toward you to start a battle. This is crucial for pulling them out of 1-tile choke points they are blocking so you can pass behind them after!

- Start Turn: 2655
- Item spotted at (22, 2). Can be accessed by luring the trainer at (24, 4) downwards.

<hr>

<h1><code>Mechanics/PC_System</code></h1>

[PC Navigation]
- To swap a Pokemon when party is full (6/6):
  1. Access PC -> Bill's PC
  2. DEPOSIT PKMN -> Select Pokemon to store -> Yes
  3. WITHDRAW PKMN -> Select Pokemon to take -> Yes
- PC menus are sensitive. Do NOT button mash. Use single A presses and verify screen state.

<hr>

<h1><code>Mechanics/Movement</code></h1>

[Movement Rules]
- Turning vs Stepping: If you change direction from a standstill, your character will "turn in place" first. This consumes an input/turn without changing your (x, y) coordinates. Account for this in long movement sequences!
- Ledges & Obstacles: Gym statues have 2-tile bases. Ledges (like the water barriers in Cerulean Gym) act as one-way drops or solid walls depending on the side. 
- ALWAYS use short, 1-3 step movements to test unfamiliar collisions before committing to long tool sequences.
[Gen 1 Movement Mechanics]
- 1st directional press turns the character in place.
- 2nd consecutive press in the same direction moves the character to the next tile.
- Custom tools MUST include a short sleep (e.g., 'sleep 150') between these presses to ensure the emulator registers them as distinct inputs, otherwise the character will just spin in place forever without triggering encounters.

<hr>

<h1><code>Mechanics/General</code></h1>

[Mechanics/LevelUp]
- Mashing B cancels move learning.
- Cascade Badge: Pokémon up to Lv 30 obey. Enables CUT outside of battle.
- TM11 (Misty): Bubblebeam.
- Nidoran F evolves into Nidorina at Level 16.

[Elevators]
- To use an elevator, step onto the 2x2 red pad.
- The control panel is located on the top-left wall inside the elevator car.
- Face the control panel (usually by stepping up if you just entered) and press 'A' to open the floor selection menu.
- Silph Scope automatically identifies Ghost-type Pokemon in battle. No need to manually use it from the bag.
- Poison in the overworld damages 1 HP every 4 steps. Keep this in mind for survival calculations!

<hr>

<h1><code>Locations/Route24</code></h1>

[Encounters]
- Route 24: Caterpie, Metapod, Abra, Bellsprout.
WARNING: Bellsprout's Vine Whip is 4x effective against Geodude. Train Cleo here instead.

<hr>

<h1><code>Locations/Route5</code></h1>

# Route 5
- Located South of Cerulean City.
- Saffron City Gate: Center lane (x=10). BLOCKED by thirsty guards. (Roof starts at y=23).
- Underground Path: Far-right lane. Door is at (17, 27).
- To reach Underground Path: Exit Cerulean City at x=28 (behind Robbed House). This puts you in Route 5 at x=18. Walk straight south to the Underground Path building. A 1-way ledge at Cerulean (28, 33) prevents going back up, proving this is the correct path. Do not trust previous hallucinated notes about x=39.

<hr>

<h1><code>Mechanics/UI</code></h1>

- Item Menu: The in-game Item menu order is chronological/manual, NOT alphabetical. Do not rely on Game State inventory order for navigation.
- Cursor Memory: The PKMN switch menu and FIGHT menu remember the last selected index per session/battle. ALWAYS visually verify the starting cursor position and pass it to custom tools (current_index) to prevent wrong selections.
- Gen 1 Menu Mechanics: The party menu and start menu both feature cursor memory (opening on the last selected item) and cursor wrapping (pressing Up at the top goes to the bottom). This breaks blind navigation macros, so always do menu navigation step-by-step or use state-aware tools.
- Cursor Memory: In Gen 1, the cursor position in menus (like the Party screen) is often remembered between opens. Always verify the blinking cursor position before mashing A or using a tool, especially when returning from a sub-menu, as it might wrap or stay where it was.
- [Turn 6149 Reflection] The party menu cursor remembers its last position even when accessed from the ITEM menu. Always verify cursor position before using an item!
- [Turn 6151 Reflection] CRITICAL: The Game State inventory list is ALPHABETIZED and does NOT match the in-game bag's chronological order. Never use Game State indices for item tools. Manual counting/scrolling is required!

# Menu Navigation
- Gen 1 Menus (Items, Pokemon, PC) have cursor memory! The cursor stays where you last left it. Always visually verify the cursor position or track it carefully before using tools that navigate menus blind.
- The Party Menu wraps around (pressing Up at the top goes to the bottom) and retains cursor memory. You cannot reset the cursor by mashing Up. Always track or visually confirm current_index before using tools.
- Inventory Mechanics: To free an inventory slot occupied by a stacked item (like Poke Balls), the ENTIRE stack must be tossed or used. Tossing just one from a stack of multiple does not free the slot.
- WARNING: Pressing START in the item menu does NOT close the menu. It selects the item below the cursor and can trigger accidental item usage. ALWAYS use B to exit menus.
- Gen 1 Item Bag Wrap-around: Pressing Up at the top item wraps to CANCEL, then pressing Up again wraps to the bottom item. Mashing Up will endlessly loop the menu, not reset the cursor to the top!
- Gen 1 UI Quirks: The OVERWORLD ITEM menu WRAPS when navigating past the top/bottom. However, the BATTLE ITEM menu DOES NOT wrap! Keep this in mind when navigating items in battle.

- Map 0_100: Reached via stairs at (3, 16) on Map 0_95. This is a large open room (crew quarters/engine room) with pink/white checkerboard floors, not a hallway. Contains several Sailors.
- Trash cans checked: The two on the left side of the room are empty. The 'odd ball' might be in a different room like the kitchen.

# Vermilion Gym
- Type: Electric
- Weaknesses: Ground (Immune to Electric)
- Gym Leader: Lt. Surge
- Team Plan: Lead with Cleo (Nidoqueen) or Pebbles (Geodude).

# Vermilion Gym Puzzle
- Start Turn: 5821
- Timestamp: Thursday, February 26, 2026 at 10:55 AM PST
- Mechanic: First switch is randomly hidden. Second switch is in an adjacent can.
- CRITICAL: Failing the second guess RESETS the puzzle AND randomizes the first switch's location again!
- I accidentally reset the puzzle by bumping into cans and mashing A. Starting over carefully.

# Navigation
- Safe horizontal paths: Y=6, Y=8, Y=10, Y=12
- Safe vertical paths: X=0, X=2, X=4, X=6, X=8, X=10

# Trash Can Grid (15 cans)
- Puzzle solved! The motorized doors are now open. The first switch was at (5, 11) and the second was at (5, 9). I can proceed to Lt. Surge! (Deleting grid to save space)

# Lt. Surge Battle
- Voltorb Lv 21 (Tackle, Screech, Sonicboom)

<h1><code>Mechanics/Input_Delays</code></h1>

# Text Box Input Delay
- Gen 1 text box delays have been eating my first D-pad input after a text box closes, causing me to turn in place instead of walking. This leads to checking the same objects multiple times.
- Solution: Move to target tile -> End Turn (verify position) -> Turn & Press A -> End Turn -> Mash B to close text -> End Turn -> Repeat. Alternatively, use sleep commands in macros (e.g. sleep 500) between closing a text box and moving.

<hr>

<h1><code>Locations/DiglettsCave</code></h1>

# Diglett's Cave
- Encounters: Diglett, Dugtrio
- Catching Strategy: Cleo (Lv 20 Nidoqueen) is too strong. Switch to Audrey (Lv 16 Bellsprout) and use Wrap, or use Pebbles (Lv 12 Geodude) to weaken them. 
- Dugtrio Contingency: If a high-level Dugtrio appears, immediately switch to Audrey to resist Ground moves. Use Wrap to chip its health. 
- Gen 1 Mechanic: Wrap is a multi-turn trapping move. The attack continues automatically for several turns. When the main battle menu reappears, it means the trap has concluded.

<hr>

<h1><code>Mechanics/Navigation</code></h1>

# Navigation Mechanics
- ALWAYS read the TYPE_ annotations on the screen grid instead of blindly guessing why movement failed. Ledges and fences require visual confirmation.
- Ledges (e.g. TYPE_44f6) enforce one-way movement. Route 5 requires looping back to the top to access the right-side lanes.
- Building identities must be verified by entering them, not by visual assumption. Saffron Gate and Underground Path are visually similar.
- Do NOT blindly trust assumed long-distance coordinate math (e.g. 'walk straight south from X'). Walk step-by-step and trace impassable tiles (water, trees) to find correct paths.
- When mapping, use exact coordinates and do not jump to conclusions about blocked paths until physically bumping into them. Use map markers to explicitly mark entrances!
- Protocol: When taking a ladder or door, immediately stop, verify the new Map ID, and step OFF the warp tile before using automation tools.

<hr>

<h1><code>Locations/Route9</code></h1>

[Route 9 Layout]
- Ledge at Y=13 drops South.
- Lane at Y=14, Y=15 is bounded by X=10 and X=23. Gap UP at X=19.
- X=9 is a solid wall from Y=10 to Y=17. Cannot go West.
- Middle lane (Y=8 to Y=12) goes East by squeezing through at Y=12, bypassing the rock wall at X=30.
- Northern path (Y=2 to Y=5) goes East past X=39 gap.

[Layout & Navigation]
- The main paved road leads west directly to the Saffron City Gate (around x=8, y=9). The guards are thirsty and will not let you pass.
- The Underground Path to Celadon City is NOT the Saffron Gate building.
- To bypass the blocked Saffron Gate, look for a Cut tree at (29, 12). Cutting this tree grants access to a narrow path that runs along the south wall of Saffron City.
- Follow this southern path westward to find more trainers (like a Gambler at x=13, y=8) and continue searching for the real Underground Path entrance.

Walk West to X=9, North/East along Y=8 to stairs at (12, 7). Go UP stairs to Northern Plateau. Walk East to stairs at (17, 7), go DOWN to (17, 8). Walk East to X=20, North to Y=3. West to X=7, South to Y=5, West to X=0, North to exit at (0, 4).
- Area 1 Center is split. From entrance (15, 25), walk West to X=14, North around central Rest House, then East to exit at (29, 10).
