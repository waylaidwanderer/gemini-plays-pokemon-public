    2. Take Mail from Kenya.
    3. Give new Flower Mail.
    4. Type: "Dark Cave leads to another road" (Mixed Case).
    5. Deliver to Fisher.

## Knowledge Base
- **Fisher (Route 31):** Rejected "DARK CAVE leads to another road." (All Caps).
- **Wade (Route 31):** Called (Turn 9576). Waiting on Route 31.
- **Dark Cave:** Connects Route 31, 45, 46. Needs Flash.

## Mechanics Log
- **Mail:** Prevents deposit. PC Full -> Mail goes to Bag. Must hold nothing to attach.
- **Inputs:** Pressing Start in Mail menu triggers Printer Error. Use B.
- **Lesson:** Pressing 'Start' in the Mail menu causes a "Printer Error" loop or crash behavior. Use 'B' to exit or 'END' to finish.
- **Recent Corrections:** Fixed typo "DARK CAV" by restarting. Resolved menu navigation errors (Accidental Save/Garnet selection).
- **Current State:** In Pack -> Items. Selecting Flower Mail.
- **Next Steps:**
    1. Select Flower Mail -> GIVE.
    2. Select Kenya.
    3. Type "DARK CAVE" (Verified).
