- Sequence: 1. Burned Tower (Done) -> 2. Cianwood (Done) -> 3. Route 42 (Done) -> 4. Route 38 (Current) -> 5. Route 14 -> 6. Tin Tower 1F.

    - Sighting 3 (Route 42): Completed Turn 21340 (Island sweep triggered flee).
    - Sighting 4 (Route 38): Heading there now. Start Turn 21387.
- Lessons Learned:
    - Pokedex Navigation: Alphabetical (A-Z). Suicune is after Sudowoodo.
