# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Standard walkable ground. Verified in Cherrygrove.
- WATER: Traversable only via Surf.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- WALL: Impassable obstacle.
- HEADBUTT_TREE: Special tree that can be interacted with using Headbutt.

- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Represents a ledge face. Impassable from ALL directions.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump from NORTH to SOUTH.
- (11, 14): Dead End Pocket in Cianwood. Wall at (11, 13) and (12, 14) blocks access to the north plateau.
- (11, 15): Gap in the city wall (Y=15) in Cianwood. Accesses the beach area but not the plateau. (Needs re-verification).

# Fly Navigation (Confirmed)
- Map: Town Map (Fly).
- Rule: 7 directional taps = 1 coordinate unit.
- Evidence: 14 taps moved cursor from New Bark (14, 10) to Cherrygrove (12, 10) [Turn 47978].
- Target: Cianwood (0, 9).
- Math: 14 units West (98 taps), 1 unit North (7 taps).

# Quest Strategies: Suicune Capture
- Fact: The northern plateau is walled off from the south and west. The buoy maze is the only intended entrance.
- Shortcut Hypothesis: Suicune (7, 4) reachable via beach at X=2. Gaps at (11, 33) and (11, 35) in Cianwood walls suggest beach access.
- Route: Fly to Cianwood -> Walk to beach at X=2 -> Walk North to Suicune at (7, 4).
- Lead: XENON (Haunter). Use SUPER REPEL.
- Strategy: Use Hypnosis to sleep Suicune. Use Night Shade (44 dmg) to lower HP. Throw Ultra Balls.
