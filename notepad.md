# Gem's Pokémon Crystal Adventure!

## Current Plan & Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Find Mr. Pokémon.
- **Secondary Goal:** Find out why the path on Route 29 is blocked.
- **Hypothesis:** A trigger event in New Bark Town is required to move the Youngster on Route 29. He is impassable otherwise.
- **Plan:** Systematically re-explore New Bark Town. 
  1. Visit Player's House, talk to Mom.
  2. Visit Elm's Lab, talk to Elm and his assistant, and interact with all objects (PCs, bookshelves).
  3. Visit the other house and talk to the NPC inside.
  4. Talk to all outdoor NPCs again.

## To-Do List

## Discoveries & Mechanics
- Some trees are 'HEADBUTT_TREE' type, likely for the move Headbutt.

## World Knowledge & NPCs
- **Route 29:** The northern path is blocked by one-way ledges. The southern path is blocked by an impassable Youngster at (27, 16) who does not respond to interaction from any angle.
- **New Bark Town:** A Fisher at (12, 9) mentioned Prof. Elm discovered new Pokémon.

- Some dialogues might loop until another object in the room is interacted with. This seems to be a mechanic to ensure full exploration of an area before proceeding.
