# Strategic Plan: Mt. Silver & Red
- **Strategy (The HOW):**
    1. Systematic search: Use `find_reachable_unseen_tiles` and Surf to reveal SilverCaveRoom2.
    2. Waterfall Exploration: Swap ICARUS for LAPIS (Poliwag) to climb waterfalls in Room 2.
    3. Target: Reach the warp at (13, 21) using Waterfall.
- Grinding Start: Turn #43530. Target Lv 75+.

# Progress Tracking
- Badges: 16/16.
- Mt. Silver Access: Unlocked.
- Inventory: 18/20 slots used (Items). Note: Item list in bag is NOT alphabetical.

# Tile Mechanics (Global Reference)
- FLOOR: Walkable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Requires Surf.
- WATERFALL: Requires HM07 Waterfall. Use while surfing and facing the waterfall tile. (Note: Menu usage may fail; interact with A button in overworld instead).
- TALL_GRASS: Wild encounters.
- DOOR/WARP: Map transitions.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks entry from the North (Verified Turn #43532). Hypothesis: Also blocks Northward exit.
- LEDGE_HOP: One-way movement.

- Strategy: Explore top section (Row 5-11) of Room 2 by land via Row 17 corridor (X=11-20).
- Task: Reach Red/Grind - Started Turn 43550.
- Grinding Strategy: Lead with Calcifer (Thunderpunch) or GNEISS (Earthquake) for efficient KOs. Use XENON for status support if needed.
- Waterfall Strategy: Successfully climbed waterfall at (10, 29) to reach upper level (Turn 43564). Use A button while facing the waterfall tile.
- Task: Collect item at (4, 20) before progressing to (11, 5).
- Path: (13, 22) -> (11, 25) -> Surf at (11, 26) -> (6, 22) -> Land at (5, 21) -> (4, 20).
