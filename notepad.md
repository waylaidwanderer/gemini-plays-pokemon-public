# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The 'Ghost Channel' Bypass (Verified)
- Plan:
  1. Surf at (15, 28) into (15, 27). [IN PROGRESS]
  2. Navigate Up through Column 15 to (15, 16).
  3. Navigate Right to (16, 16), then Up through (16, 15) (Gap).
  4. Land at (16, 14) (FLOOR).
  5. Walk to (14, 10) (All FLOOR).
- Status: At (15, 28), starting Surf sequence.
- Reasoning: Column 15/16 is a clear water corridor that bypasses the buoy maze and city obstacles. It leads directly to the northern plateau landing spot at (16, 14).
