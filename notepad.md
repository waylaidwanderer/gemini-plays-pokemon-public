# Current Status
- **Status:** On Route 25.
- **Location:** (40, 4).
- **Goal:** Return to Cerulean City to access Route 9 (Power Plant).
- **Action:** Navigate South to Cerulean Gym.

# Quest Logic (Cascade Badge)
1. **Fact:** I possess TM07 (Zap Cannon) => Power Plant Quest Complete.
2. **Current Task:** Check Cerulean Gym for Misty.
3. **Contingency:** If Gym is empty, check Route 25 (Cape) again (maybe I missed her or she spawned after I left).
4. **Note:** Misty appears at the Cape *after* the Power Plant event is resolved. Since it is resolved, she should be there or at the Gym. I checked the Cape before, but maybe I didn't trigger the specific spot or she wasn't there yet? Or maybe she's at the Gym now.

# Route 9 Access
- **Location:** East of Cerulean City.
- **Requirement:** Cut (Have it).

# Key Locations
- **Power Plant:** Route 9.
- **Cerulean Gym:** Cerulean City.
- **Cape:** Route 25 (North East).
