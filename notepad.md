# Current Strategy: Defeat Red
- **Start Turn:** 26773 (Jan 7, 2026)
- **Location:** Silver Cave Room 3 (3_76)
- **Status:** In Battle with Red. Kunai fainted.
- **Action:** Sending **Muscle (Machoke)** back in.
- **Matchup:** Muscle (Lv 83) vs Espeon (Lv 73).
- **Goal:** Defeat Red.
- **Battle Plan:**
  - **Stat Reset:** Muscle's -2 Attack is gone thanks to the switch.
  - **Espeon:** **High Danger**. Will use Psychic. Muscle must tank one hit and OHKO with **Cross Chop** or **Strength**.
    - Cross Chop: High Power (150 w/ STAB), Low Accuracy (80%). High Crit.
    - Strength: Moderate Power (80), High Accuracy (100%).
    - Decision: Cross Chop for the likely OHKO.
  - **Healing:** If Muscle takes heavy damage (>50%), assume next Psychic kills. Use Max Potion/Full Restore. If really low, switch to fodder to Revive/Heal safely.
- **Items:** 15 Full Restores, 19 Revives.

# Key Findings
- **Silver Cave:** Room 2 Warp (11, 5) led directly to Room 3 (Red's Chamber), not Item Rooms.
