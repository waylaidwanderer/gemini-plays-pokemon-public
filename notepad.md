# Reflection (Turn 35564)
- **Menu Hygiene:** "Macro" sequences with `sleep` are safer, but visual confirmation is best. "Intermediate States" can be confusing; trust "Current Screen Text".
- **Economics:** Super Repel (500g/200steps = 2.5g/step) is more efficient than Max Repel (700g/250steps = 2.8g/step). Prioritize Super Repels.
- **Status:** Turn 35570 - Exiting Medicine Clerk menu (`B` x2). Moving Down to (11, 6) to talk to Item/Ball Clerk. Goal: Buy 4 Super Repels.
