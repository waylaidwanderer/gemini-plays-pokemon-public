# Ice Path Strategy
- **Current Action:** Backtracking from East Floor.
- **Goal:** Find Ladder to B1F.
- **Status:** Found **HM07 (Waterfall)** at (31, 7).

# Ice Path Strategy
- **Current Action:** Testing Ledge Mechanics.
- **Goal:** Access South-West Area.
- **Location:** Heading to Hub (20, 23).
- **Hypothesis:** Jumping from FLOOR (20, 23) to LEDGE (20, 24) allows access to SW.
- **Contingency:** If jump fails, proceed to West Ice Room Entrance (15, 14).
- **Items:** Item Balls at (32, 23), (35, 9) [Inaccessible].

# Mechanics & Lessons
- **Ice Physics:** Sliding continues until collision.
- **Ledges:** `FLOOR_UP_WALL` tiles behave like walls from *Ice* (tested). Testing from *Floor*.

# Map Structure
- **West:** Ice Room (Puzzle solved).
- **Center:** Hub.
- **East:** Winding corridors.
- **South:** Unexplored SW area.
