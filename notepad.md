# Ice Path Strategy
- **Current Action:** Exploring West Room off East Corridor.
- **Goal:** Find Ladder to B1F in the room at (25-27, 12-16).
- **Reasoning:**
  - North path (Row 10) is blocked by ledges (one-way South).
  - East path (x=31) is a solid wall.
  - West path at (29, 12) leads to an unexplored room.
  - Hypothesis: The ladder to B1F is in this room.
- **Items:** Item Balls at (32, 23), (35, 9), (31, 7).

# Mechanics & Lessons
- **Ice Physics:** Sliding continues until collision.
- **Ledges:** `FLOOR_UP_WALL` tiles are impassable walls.

# Map Structure
- **West:** Entrance (Route 44).
- **Center:** Hub.
- **East:** Winding corridors leading to... a dead end? Or a ladder?
