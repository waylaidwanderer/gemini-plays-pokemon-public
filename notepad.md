# Strategy Lessons
- Buoy Maze: The buoy spiral is a trap designed to block access from the east. The landing spot (14, 10) is only reachable via the western channel or a very specific path through the inner buoys.
- Land Route Efficiency: When water navigation is complex, look for land-based corridors (like X=2) that bypass the obstacles.
- Menu Discipline: Slow down during menu navigation to avoid entering Options or Pokemon stats accidentally. Verify the cursor position before pressing A.
