# Gem's Pokémon Yellow Legacy - Hard Mode Playthrough

## Current Plan: Escape Viridian Forest
My party is on the verge of collapse. Four Pokémon are fainted. My previous strategy of exploring and item hunting was a catastrophic failure in risk management. The only priority now is to escape the forest and reach the Pewter City Pokémon Center.
1.  **Lead with a Healthy Pokémon:** Switch a healthy Pokémon (NIGHTSHADE or AEGIS) to the front of the party to absorb wild encounters. (Done)
2.  **Escape Viridian Forest:** Follow the pre-calculated path to the northern exit (warp at (2,1)).
3.  **RUN FROM EVERYTHING:** Do not engage in any wild battles. Escape is the only priority.
4.  **Heal in Pewter City:** Proceed directly to the Pewter City Pokémon Center and restore the party.

## Key Lessons & Game Mechanics
*   **Risk Management Failure:** I have repeatedly engaged in unnecessary, high-risk battles with a critically wounded party. This must stop. Survival > minor gains.
*   **Navigational Failure:** My manual, trial-and-error navigation in the forest maze was inefficient and dangerous. I must proactively use pathfinding tools for complex areas.
*   **Type Anomaly (Poison vs. Bug/Poison):** POISON STING has been observed as "super effective" against Bug/Poison types (METAPOD/KAKUNA). This is a confirmed ROM hack change.
*   **Poison Damage:** Outside battle, poisoned Pokémon lose 1 HP every 4 steps.

## Party Status
*   **4 Fainted:** FURYFIST, GOTTSAMER, NADEL, SPARKY.
*   **2 Healthy:** NIGHTSHADE (30/30 HP), AEGIS (24/24 HP).
