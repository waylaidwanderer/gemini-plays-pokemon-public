# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Objective
Trigger the Suicune sighting at (14, 10) in Cianwood City (Map 22_3).

## Strategy
- Talk to Pokefan M (17, 33) to get Rock Smash (TM08). (In Progress)
- Navigate the western land bypass via (4, 30) and (4, 20) to reach the plateau.
- Avoid the eastern channel (Column 27+) as it is partitioned from the target area.

## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way North slopes. Ascent only.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way South ledges. Descent only.
- WATER (Edge): Does not always warp. (0, 49) in Route 41 is a dead end.

## Key Coordinates
- (17, 33): Pokefan M.
- (4, 30), (4, 20): Terrace climb slopes.
- (14, 10): Suicune trigger point.
