# Tile Mechanics (Verified)

- COUNTER: Impassable; interact with from front.

- LADDER: Warp tile; triggers warp when stepping on.
- PC: Impassable; interact from below.
- TALL_GRASS: Triggers wild encounters.
- LONG_GRASS: Triggers wild encounters (lower rate).

# Pokedex Navigation Trick
- To find Suicune (#245) quickly: Open Numerical Pokedex -> Press UP from #001 to wrap to #251 -> Press UP 6 more times (7 total UPs) to reach #245 Suicune.
- Order: 251 (Celebi) -> 250 (Ho-Oh) -> 249 (Lugia) -> 248 (Tyranitar) -> 247 (Pupitar) -> 246 (Larvitar) -> 245 (Suicune).
