### Current Objectives & Strategy
- **Main Quest**: Begin the Gym Challenge (Violet City).
- **Immediate Goal**: Reach Cherrygrove City.
- **Healing**: Mom (New Bark) does NOT heal. Elm did NOT heal. Relied on Berries.
- **Status**: Party HP Critical. Need Pokemon Center.

### Route 29 Navigation Puzzle
- **Problem**: Returned from Cherrygrove via "Ledge Path" (One-way East). Now need to go West.
- **Observations**:
  - **Upper Path (Rows 8-9)**: Seemed to be one-way ledges facing East.
  - **Middle Path (Row 11)**: Blocked by Cut Tree at x=21.
  - **Lower Path (Row 14)**: Currently traversing.
    - Blocked at x=37 by trees.
    - **Solution**: Go South to Row 16 to bypass the tree line at x=34-37.
    - **Goal**: Reach the corridor at x=26.
- **Hypothesis**:
  - **A**: The path to Cherrygrove involves weaving between tree lines on the south side.
  - **B**: Once at x=26, head North/West to bypass the "Dead End" at x=13.
- **Plan**:
  1. Check South-East entrance of Route 29 (below the ledge output).
  2. If blocked, check North-East entrance (above the ledge output).
  3. Look closely for gaps in the ledge line.

### Key Locations
- **Cherrygrove City**: Pokemon Center, Mart.
- **Route 30**: Path to Violet City.

### Mechanics
- **Ledges**: Jump South (usually). Or East? Route 29 has specific directional ledges?
- **Cut Trees**: Require Badge 2 + HM01.
- Aide in New Bark Town (after Lab) gives Pokegear tutorial, NOT Potions.
- Confirmed: Must travel to Cherrygrove to heal.
