# Johto Progression: The Rock Smash Quest
## Primary Goal: Obtain TM08 Rock Smash
- **Strategy:** Talk to NPCs on Route 36.
- **Hypothesis:** The Fisher at (44, 9) gives TM08.
- **Status:** Talked to Fisher (Turn 50434), he explained the move but didn't give the TM.
- **Next Step:** Talk to him again, then explore Route 36 west of (35, 9).
- **Quest Start:** Turn 50407.

## Secondary Goal: Trigger Suicune Sighting in Cianwood City
- **Location:** (14, 10) in Cianwood City.
- **Status:** Blocked by boulders at (4, 19) and (8, 16).
- **Route to Suicune:** From (12, 17) -> (11, 16) -> (11, 12) -> (14, 12) -> (14, 10).

## Global Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable.
- WATER: Requires Surf.
- DOOR / WARP_CARPET: Warp point.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way South jump.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way North climb.
- SMASHABLE_ROCK (Object): Impassable. Requires Rock Smash move to clear.

## Failed Hypotheses
- Eastern Water Route (Cianwood): Blocked by Row 15 wall/buoy line.
- Cianwood NPCs: Hints only (Turns 50278-50364).
- Western Land Bypass (Cianwood): Blocked by rocks at (4, 19). Rock Smash is a hard requirement.
