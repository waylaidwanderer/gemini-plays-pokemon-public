## Suicune Quest Log (Crystal Version)
- Prerequisites: Clear Bell (Obtained).
- Quest Start: Turn 24182.
- Sequence:
  1. Burned Tower (Flee event observed).
  2. Cianwood City North (Flee event observed).
  3. Eusine Battle (Cianwood) - Defeated (Turn 21034).
  4. Route 42 sighting: REQUIRED. Target: (26, 15).
  5. Route 36 sighting: REQUIRED. Target: (35, 9).
  6. Tin Tower Gatehouse: Sage passage granted (Turn 26846).
  7. Wise Trio Battle: Gated by sightings.

## Strategy for Wise Trio Battle
- Sages: Gaku, Masa, Koji.
- Pokémon: Noctowl (Lv32) and Kadabra (Lv32).
- Strategy: Lead Calcifer (Typhlosion) with Thunderpunch.
- Note: Sages will ONLY battle once all Suicune sightings are complete.

## Tile Mechanics - Global
- **FLOOR**: Standard walkable tile.
- **WALL / VOID / HEADBUTT_TREE**: Impassable terrain.
- **WATER**: Traversable via SURF.
- **CUT_TREE**: Requires CUT to clear.
- **LEDGE_HOP**: One-way traversal (jump).
- **DOOR / STAIRS / LADDER**: Warp tiles.

## General Lessons Learned
- **Sequential Events:** Legendary beast sightings are strictly sequential.
- **Verification:** An empty location does NOT mean a sighting is complete. The event must be triggered by approaching the specific coordinates.
- **Sage Passage:** Passing the gatehouse sage does NOT mean sightings are complete; it only means you have the Clear Bell (or Eusine is defeated). The Trio inside is the final check.

## Suicune Sighting Troubleshooting
- Route 42 (26, 15): Target. Must approach precisely. If empty, check for Eusine nearby.
- Route 36 (35, 9): Attempted (Turn 26933) - No trigger.
- Hypothesis: Tracker assumed "empty" meant "triggered," but it might mean "not yet spawned."
- To Check:
  - Approach (26, 15) on Route 42 from the water/south.
  - Check if Eusine appears after the flee.
  - If Route 42 triggers, THEN go to Route 36.
