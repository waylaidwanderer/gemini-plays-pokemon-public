# Suicune Hunt Strategy (Crystal)
- Trigger Logic: Proximity-based sighting sequence. Suicune does NOT roam. Pokedex "Area" will be "Unknown" until Tin Tower.
- Sighting 3 (Route 42): Proximity trigger on central island (X:22-30, Y:12-17).
- Sighting 4: Route 36 (Sudowoodo junction).
- Sighting 5: Tin Tower 1F (Final).
- Pivot Plan: If Route 42 sweep fails, verify prerequisites:
    - Ecruteak City: Check Wise Trio (Tin Tower Gatehouse).
    - Cianwood City: Re-verify Eusine dialogue post-Suicune sighting.

# Battle Strategy: Suicune
- Status: Leading with XENON (Gastly).
- Overworld: Scripted fleeing events. Mean Look not required.
- Scripted Battle (Tin Tower): Focus on Hypnosis/Sleep Powder and chip damage.

# Type Effectiveness (Verified)
- Fire -> Grass: Super Effective
