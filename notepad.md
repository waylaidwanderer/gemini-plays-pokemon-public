# Systematic Island Sweep (Route 42)
- Objective: Step on the trigger tile for the Suicune overworld event.
- Reachable Tiles: (20, 10-11), (21, 10-11), (22, 10-12), (23, 10-12), (24, 10-14), (25, 10-12, 14-15), (26, 10-12, 14-17), (27, 10-12, 14-15, 17), (28, 10-12, 15, 17), (29, 10-11, 15, 17), (30, 10-11, 15-17).
- Method: Walk through each coordinate group until event triggers.

# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN/RIGHT: One-way movement.
- LEDGE_HOP_LEFT/UP: Impassable.
- COUNTER: Interact from adjacent tile.
- HEADBUTT_TREE/CUT_TREE: Impassable; Cut removes Cut Trees.

# Lessons Learned
- Menu Navigation: Scrolling in the Pokedex is sensitive; use fewer 'Down' presses and verify current selection before clicking 'AREA'.
- Pathing: Objects like Fruit Trees block movement; always check 'Map Objects' before planning a path through a tile.
