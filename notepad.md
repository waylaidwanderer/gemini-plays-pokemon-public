# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
- **Start Turn:** 49885
- **Current Status:** Executing the "Ocean Loop" via the eastern sea.

## Active Strategy: The Ocean Loop
The northern plateau (14, 10) is accessible via the western coastal highway (X=2). To reach X=2, we must bypass the island's elevation traps by surfing south through the eastern ocean to the southern clearway (Row 51).

### Execution Plan
1. Central Pivot: Navigate to (12, 28) (Central Surf Point). (In Progress)
2. Ocean Transit: Surf South along X=24 to Row 51.
3. Southern Traverse: Walk West along Row 51 to (2, 51).
4. Coastal Highway: Walk North along X=2 to Row 12.
5. Final Approach: Walk East to (14, 12) and North to Suicune at (14, 10).

## Verified Mechanics
- Row 51: Completely clear land bridge across the bottom of the island.
- X=2 Highway: Clear land corridor from Row 51 to Row 12.
- X=24 Surf: Clear water path from Row 28 to Row 51.

## Battle Plan: Eusine
- Roster: Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25).
- Strategy: Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion) Flamethrower sweep.

## Failed Hypotheses
- Hypothesis 1: Land access via central gaps. Result: Blocked by one-way UP_WALLs.
- Hypothesis 2: Direct Surf to beach. Result: Beach is a dead end.
- Hypothesis 3: Cut tree at (11, 13). Result: Fake tree (solid wall).
