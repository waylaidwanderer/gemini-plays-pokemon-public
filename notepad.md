## Battle Strategy (Blackthorn Gym)
- Leader Clair: Dragonair Lv37 x3, Kingdra Lv40.
- Kingdra Strategy: Only weak to Dragon. Use Typhlosion (Lv45) with Thunderpunch and Graveler (Lv44) with Earthquake.
- Dragonair Strategy: Weak to Ice. Catch Swinub or Jynx in Ice Path.

## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Walkable. NOTE: B1F floor tiles do NOT slide. B2F floor islands are walkable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Needs Surf (HM03).
- ICE: Sliding mechanic. B1F northern corridor (Row 1-2) and B2F large rink. Moving onto ICE causes sliding until hitting non-ICE, wall, or object.
- PIT: Warp to B2F. Dropping a boulder fills the pit on B2F, creating a "stopper" tile.
- BOULDER: Pushable with Strength (HM04). Resets to start position when changing floors via ladder or pit.
- STRENGTH: Must be re-activated after every floor transition or battle.

# Lessons Learned
- Boulders: Dropped boulders serve as stoppers on B2F ice to reach the central ladder at (9, 11).
- Catch List: Swinub (Common), Jynx (Rare). Use Sleep Powder/Hypnosis. Strategy Advisor says not strictly necessary but helpful.
