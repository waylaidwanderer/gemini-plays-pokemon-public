### Current Objectives & Strategy
- **Main Quest**: Navigate Ilex Forest to Goldenrod City.
- **Location**: Northern Ilex Forest (Hidden Path).
- **Status**: At (15, 0). Verified that the path West loops back to the Bug Catcher Wayne area (x=12).
- **Correction**: The exit must be at the Gatehouse (x=23). The "Hidden Path" is likely just a connector.
- **Navigation**: Backtracking East to (23, 0) to re-attempt the Gatehouse Warp at (23, 2)/(23, 3).
- **Hypothesis**: The Hoothoot battle at (23, 2) interrupted the warp. I need to step on (23, 2) again without an encounter.

### Team Status
- **Party**: Garnet (Lv23), Amethyst (Lv8), T (Lv3), Jasper (Lv2), Basil (Lv6), Pearl (Togepi, Lv5).
- **PC**: Jade (Oddish).
