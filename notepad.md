  5. **Next Step:** Receive Reward -> Fly Ecruteak -> Route 42.
- **Route Info:** Route 31.
- **Mail Status:** Kenya delivered (or about to be).

## Mechanics Notes
- **Fly Map:** Navigation is list-based via `Up`/`Down`. Order: New Bark -> Cherrygrove -> Violet -> Azalea -> Goldenrod.
- **Menu Cursor:** Remember position! Always reset or verify.

### Reflection (Turn 8681)
- **Execution:** Addressed "Cursor Memory" issues by resetting via Start Menu. Debugged Fly Map navigation step-by-step.
- **Notepad:** Cleaned up obsolete typing logs. Recorded Fly Map list logic.
- **Lesson:** When blind inputs fail, STOP and verify with screen text. Do not assume standard grid navigation.
