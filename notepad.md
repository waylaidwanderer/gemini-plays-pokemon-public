# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard traversable tile.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable collision.
- WATER: Requires SURF.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (South). Blocks North.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way climb slope. Approach from South (Up move) to climb. Impassable from North (Acts as WALL).
- BREAKABLE ROCK: Requires ROCK SMASH.
