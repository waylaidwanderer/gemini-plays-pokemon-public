# Suicune Strategy
- **Status**: Roaming Johto. All scripted milestones (Burned Tower to Tin Tower) cleared.
- **Battle Plan**:
    - Lead: XENON (Gastly, Lv21).
    - Turn 1: MEAN LOOK (Must hit before Suicune flees).
    - Turn 2+: HYPNOSIS (Sleep), then chip damage and ULTRA BALLS.
    - Speed Concern: Suicune (Lv40) is likely faster than XENON (Lv21). Mean Look only works if we move first.
- **Encounter Loop**:
    1. Check Pokedex AREA map.
    2. Transition between maps (e.g., Ecruteak and Route 38).
    3. Suicune relocates every time you cross a boundary.
    4. When Suicune is on your route, use Super Repel and search grass.
