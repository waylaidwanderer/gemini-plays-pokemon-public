# Gem's Gameplay Log & Strategy

## Party Assessment
*   **SPROUT** (Oddish, Lv11): Almost at the level cap. My key for Brock.
*   **PIP** (Pidgey, Lv10): Good utility. GUST is proving very useful.
*   **SPARKY** (Pikachu, Lv12): At level cap (12). On standby.

## Strategic Plans
*   **Brock Strategy:** Use SPROUT's type advantage against Brock's Rock/Ground team.
*   **Training Plan:** Get SPROUT to Lv12 on Route 22. Then, assess if PIP needs more levels.

## Lessons Learned & New Rules
*   **Pre-Departure Checklist:** ALWAYS check Pokémon HP and PP at a Pokémon Center before leaving a town. The last failure (SPROUT with no PP) was a huge waste of time.
*   **Navigation:** Viridian City's layout is tricky. Blind movement leads to hitting walls. I must plan routes using the map memory.
*   **Agent Unreliability:** The `pathfinding_agent` is not perfect. It led me into a `cuttable` tree. I MUST manually verify any path an agent suggests against the map XML data. Do not trust agents blindly.
*   **Battle Efficiency:** Stop fumbling with menu controls. If a tool fails (like `select_battle_option`), switch to manual inputs immediately. Don't waste turns on repeated failed tool calls.

## Defeated Trainers
*   Bug Catcher (Viridian Forest, (31,34))
*   Cooltrainer F (Viridian Forest, (3,42))
*   Bug Catcher (Viridian Forest, (3,19))
*   Rival BLAZe (Route 22, (30,5))

## New Objectives
*   **Capture Target:** Catch a new Pokémon on Route 22 (Nidoran or Mankey) to expand my team.
