## III. Area & Navigation Insights

### Tile Traversal Rules (Verified)
- **Objects are impassable:** All map objects (items, trees, signs, defeated trainers etc.) act as as walls.
- **WALL:** Impassable.
- **FLOOR:** Traversable.
- **TALL_GRASS:** Traversable, triggers wild encounters.
- **LEDGE:** One-way downward traversal.
- **COUNTER:** Impassable.
- **DOOR/CAVE/LADDER:** Warp tile, triggered by movement.
- **MART_SHELF/BOOKSHELF/TV/RADIO/PC/TOWN_MAP/WINDOW/PAINTING/STATUE/PILLAR:** Impassable scenery.
- **WATER/CUT_TREE/BUOY/HEADBUTT_TREE:** Impassable.
- **WARP_CARPET_*: Warp tile, direction-specific.
- **FRUIT_TREE:** Impassable object, may yield items.

## IV. Untested Hypotheses & To-Do
- **To-Do:** Check for alternative healing methods besides the Pokémon Center.
- **To-Do:** Talk to the Gym Guide in the Violet City Gym.
- **Hypothesis:** My current team, heavily reliant on a single high-level Pokémon, may struggle against the Gym Leader.

## V. Strategic Notes
- **Onix's Moveset:** My Onix (ROCKY) lacks a Rock-type move, which is a major disadvantage in the Flying-type Violet City Gym. **Plan:** Level up ROCKY and hope he learns a Rock-type move soon, or find a TM. For the Falkner fight, I will have to rely almost exclusively on G (Croconaw) and potentially use ROCKY for defensive switching or to use SCREECH.
- **Party Full:** My party is now full with the addition of the Egg. I can't catch any new Pokémon until I deposit one in the PC.
