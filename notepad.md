# Lessons Learned
- Pokedex Navigation: Wrapping from #001 to #251 is faster, but requires 6 more UP presses to reach #245 (Suicune).
- Menu Buffering: Avoid mixing directional and action buttons too quickly.
- Route 38 Hazards: "Ledge pocket" between (8, 14) and (23, 14). Entrance is via ledge hop down (Row 13). Exit requires Fly.
- Valley Trap: Area between x=7 and x=10 (Row 12). Dead end North. Exit South or Fly.
- Menu Mechanics: Always verify cursor position in Party/Pack menus due to cursor persistence. Use a "B-reset" (press B 4 times) before navigating deep menus.

# Side Quests
- Quick Claw: National Park (35, 12). Talk to Teacher on bench with Persian.
- Yanma Swarm: Caught.
- Sick Miltank (Moomoo Farm): Needs many Berries to recover.
