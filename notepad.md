### Strategic Reflection (Turn 8719)
- **Status**: Stuck in Goldenrod for ~100 turns.
- **Issue**: Oscillating between East/West without clearing the "fog of war".
- **Insight**: The North-East (Flower Shop) is a cul-de-sac. The Central North Wall seems solid. The only remaining option is the North-West quadrant, which is largely "unseen".
- **Action Plan**: 
    1. Return to Main Street (y=10).
    2. Move West to x=6.
    3.Systematically explore North from there, hugging the West edge.

### Navigation Notes
- **Location**: Goldenrod City (Tracks Crossing).
- **Goal**: Investigate "Wall" at x=5 (West of Game Corner).
- **Status**: Crossing tracks North at (18, 14).
- **Plan**: 
    1. Cross tracks to (18, 10).
    2. Move West along Row 8/9/10 to (6, 8).
    3. Verify if (5, 8) is truly a solid wall or if there is a gap I missed.
- **Hypothesis**: The path to the far West (and Route 35) is past the x=5 line.

### Quest Chain: SquirtBottle
1. **Defeat Whitney**: Done (Plain Badge obtained).
2. **Find Floria**: Currently seeking at Route 36.
3. **Get Bottle**: Return to Flower Shop after meeting Floria.

### Key Locations
- **Game Corner**: (9, 5).
- **Target**: (5, 8).
