# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- Quest Start: Turn 48900

## Execution Plan (Southern Surf Bypass)
1. Walk to (23, 32) and use Surf. <- CURRENT TASK
2. Surf South through the X=27 channel to Row 51.
3. Surf West to (24, 51) and land.
4. Walk West to (2, 51), then North to (2, 14).
5. Walk East to (8, 14), then North to (8, 10).
6. Walk East to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

## Strategy: Southern Surf Bypass
Terrestrial paths to the western corridor are blocked by multiple upward ledge lines (Row 34, 46, 48, 50). The only way to reach the plateau is to Surf around the south end of the map. By following the eastern channel down to Row 51, I can reach the southern landing and bypass all city barriers.

## Tile Mechanics (Cianwood)
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way ledge. Blocks South movement. (Verified at Row 34, 46, 48, 50).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way ledge. Blocks North movement.

## Failed Hypotheses & Lessons
- Terrestrial Path: Blocked by ledge/wall combinations at Row 34, 40, and 46.
- Inner Channel (X=12): Blocked at Row 15 by solid buoy wall.
- Island Hop (13, 16): Dead end pocket at (11, 14).

## Progress Summary
- All 16 Badges obtained.
- Current Focus: Suicune tracking.
