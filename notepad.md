# Current Puzzle: The Wise Trio & The Sealed Room
- **Goal:** Access the center room (Suicune) or trigger the Wise Trio battle.
- **Status:** Spoke to all 3 Sages. They gave lore but did not battle.
- **Problem:** Warp at (10,2) is INACTIVE (not listed in Game State Warps).
- **Hypothesis:** I must trigger the battle with the Wise Trio to unlock the path.
- **Plan:** Re-approach Sages and attempt to move past/into them to trigger the event. Starting with Sage at (14,6).

# Map Markers
- **Sages:** (5,9), (14,6), (11,11).
- **Beasts:** Suicune (9,9), Entei (12,12).

# Lore
- **Wise Trio:** Testing me.
- **Brass Tower:** Burned down. 3 beasts reborn.
- **Analysis:** I've defeated the Wise Trio (in the Barrier Station) and battled Suicune once (and lost). Suicune is likely still here.
- **Problem:** Can't reach Suicune. Warp at (10,2) is inactive.
- **Correction:** Sage at (5,9) changes facing direction (Left -> Up observed).
- **Action:** Interacting with Sage at (5,9) from the side (4,9).
- **Hypothesis:** If he doesn't battle, I need to find the stairs to 2F in the unexplored corners.
- **Plan:** Interact, then explore bottom-left corner (0,15).
- **Observation:** Sage at (5,9) did not battle when interacted with.
- **Map Analysis:** Bottom-Left area (2-6, 15) appears isolated by walls.
- **Plan:** Navigate to (8,15) to inspect the wall at (7,15). If impassable, the area is sealed.
- **Map Analysis:** Bottom-Left room (Row 15, Col 2-6) is inaccessible from 1F. Must be a drop zone.
- **Entei Marker:** Marker at (12,12) appears to be ghost data (Entei is not currently there).
- **Plan:** Explore suspicious nooks in Top-Left area: (3,9) and (2,7).
- **Hypothesis:** Hidden stairs or switches might be in these secluded tiles.
- **Action:** Exploring Top-Right corner (Row 1, Col 13-16) for stairs.
- **Hypothesis:** Stairs to 2F are hidden in a corner. (10,2) warp is likely an exit from above.
- **Plan:** Navigate to (16,1) and inspect the area. Then check Bottom-Right if empty.
