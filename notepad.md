# Gem's Strategic Plan

## Primary Goal: Defeat Brock (Pewter City Gym)
*   **Path:** Viridian City -> Route 2 -> Viridian Forest -> Pewter City.

## Secondary Goal: Train Party to Level Cap (12)
*   **Priority PokÃ©mon:** SPROUT (Lv. 11), PIP (Lv. 10), THISTLE (Lv. 4).
*   **Training Location:** Route 2 & Viridian Forest (opportunistic).

## Agent Usage Protocols
*   **`pathfinding_agent`:** Use PROACTIVELY for any non-trivial navigation (especially in cities) to avoid getting lost. It is my responsibility to clear obstacles on the path it provides.
*   **`battle_strategist_agent`:** Use IMMEDIATELY if a battle becomes difficult or unpredictable.
*   **`pre_adventure_checker_agent`:** ALWAYS use before leaving a town to ensure party readiness.

## Failed Hypotheses Log
*   **Manual Navigation in Viridian City:** Highly inefficient. Resulted in getting lost and multiple loops. (Failed >15 times). **Resolution: Use `pathfinding_agent`**.
*   **Route 22 Training Area:** Assumed the main grassy area was accessible from the south. It is blocked by ledges. (Failed >5 attempts to access). **Resolution: Abandoned Route 22, proceeding on main quest path.**
*   **Battle of Attrition (PIP vs. Pidgey):** Attempted to win with PIP despite severe accuracy debuffs. Resulted in near-faint and wasted turns. (Failed >3 attack attempts). **Resolution: Switch to a reliable counter (SPARKY) immediately when a fight goes south.**

## Defeated Trainers
*   Bug Catcher (Viridian Forest, (31,34))
*   Cooltrainer F (Viridian Forest, (3,42))
*   Bug Catcher (Viridian Forest, (3,19))
*   Rival BLAZe (Route 22, (30,5))
