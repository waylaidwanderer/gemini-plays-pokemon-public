## Navigation Log
- **Olivine & Route 40:** Cleared Lighthouse. Surfed West to Route 41.
- **Route 41 (Whirl Islands):** Navigated maze-like buoys. Defeated many Swimmers. Found passage West to Cianwood at Row 45.
- **Cianwood City:** Arrived.
    - **Key Locations:** Pokemon Center (23, 43), Pharmacy (15, 47), Lugia House (15, 37), Mania's House (17, 41), Poke Seer (5, 17).
    - **Events:** Defeated Eusine (Suicune fled). Obtained SecretPotion.
    - **Exploration:** Smashed rocks at (4,25), (4,19), (8,16), (10,27). Surfing North to find Gym.

## Battle Log
- **Gym Trainers:** Defeated Yoshi, Lao, Nob, Lung.
- **Leader Chuck:** Primeape (Defeated), Poliwrath (Incoming).
- **Gym Layout:** Left side has Blackbelts. Right side has boulders (3,7), (4,7), (5,7).
- **Boulder Puzzle Strategy (Corrected):**
  1. Push Left Boulder (3,7) UP. [x]
  2. Push Right Boulder (5,7) UP. [x]
  3. Push Middle Boulder (4,7) RIGHT (to 5,7). [x]
  4. Walk North through (4,7) -> (4,6).
- **Plan:** Defeat trainers and Chuck.
- **Exploration Update:** Surfing East/North from the beach at (13, 16) is blocked by rocks and buoys. The "channel" at Col 18 is a dead end.
- **New Hypothesis:** The Gym is accessible by going North from the smashed rock location at (4, 19), passing to the left of the Poke Seer's house. I previously jumped South from there, but North seems unexplored.
- **Investigation:** (10, 14) (Suicune spot) appears to be a dead end.
- **New Plan:** Heading to the far South-West corner (Row 50+) to check for a path up the western coast. Access via column 11.
- **Strategy vs Chuck:** Muscle (Lv 39) is the lead. Saving the Super Potion for in-battle emergency since Muscle has 66/127 HP and a level advantage.
- **Matchup:** Muscle vs Primeape/Poliwrath. Beware DynamicPunch confusion.
- **Battle Result:** Lost to Chuck. Wiped out by Poliwrath.
- **Current Status:** Respawned at Cianwood Center. Team fully healed. Money: 8923.
- **Immediate Goal:** Buy supplies at Pharmacy.
- **Shopping List:**
  - **Hyper Potions:** Better value/slot efficiency for Muscle (127 HP). Aim for 4-5.
  - **Full Heals:** Essential for DynamicPunch Confusion. Aim for 4-5.
- **Rematch Strategy:**
  - Muscle (Lv 39) must be full HP for Poliwrath.
  - Use Full Heals to cure Confusion immediately. Do not rely on switching (free hits for Poliwrath).
  - Use Hyper Potions to stay out of crit range.
  - Muscle's Strength is the main damage source.
- **Gym Trainers:** Defeated Yoshi, Lao, Nob, Lung.
