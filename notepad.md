# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Cross the whirlpool to reach the Dragon Shrine.

# Key Mechanics & Lessons
- **Field Moves:** If 'A' interaction fails (even when facing correctly), ALWAYS fallback to Menu -> Pokemon -> [Mon] -> [Move].
- **Whirlpool:** Requires facing the whirlpool tile directly. 'A' button might be unreliable; Menu is safer.

- Status: Navigating Party Menu for Whirlpool.
- Reason: Menu is open. Cursor on 'POKEMON'. Using slow_press to navigate to Lapis efficiently.
- Step 1: 'A' (Enter Party) -> 'Down' x2 (Select Lapis) -> 'A' (Open Lapis Options).
- Step 2: In next turn, select 'WHIRLPOOL' from the list.
