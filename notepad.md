# 2. S.S. Anne - Current Objective
- **Primary Goal:** Find the Captain to get HM CUT.
- **Secondary Goal:** Defeat BLAZe to reach the Captain.
- **Key Discoveries:**
    - The path to the Captain is on the S.S. Anne Bow, after defeating trainers and the rival.
    - The kitchen 'odd ball' hint was a red herring for a GREAT BALL, not a switch.
    - The S.S. Anne 2F is split into two disconnected corridors.
    - HM STRENGTH: A Super Nerd on B1F mentioned his Machoke has STRENGTH. This is likely the HM.

# 3. Item & TM Usage
- **TM44 (Rest):** Taught to PARCH. (COMPLETE)
- **TM08 (Body Slam):** Plan to teach to THISTLE, replacing Tackle.

# 4. General Gameplay Insights
- **Systematic Exploration:** Clear areas methodically. Trust agents, but verify and adapt if they fail.
- **NPC Interaction:** Non-battling/defeated trainers are impassable walls. Some event NPCs offer gifts or block paths.
- **Game Mechanics:**
    - Poison deals 1 HP damage every 4 steps.
    - Level-capped Pokémon show fake EXP gain.
    - Non-volatile status conditions are cured after trainer battles.
    - PC System: 'SOMEONE's PC' is for Pokémon, 'Gem's PC' is for Items.
- **Unverified Assumptions:**
    - The S.S. Anne might leave after I get HM Cut. I should be efficient.
