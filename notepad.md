- **Goal**: Defeat Morty (Leader).
- **Location**: Player at (6, 5). Morty is at (5, 1).

  - Current Status: Garnet 74/93 HP.
  - Active: Garnet (Lv 33).
  - Opponent: Gengar (Lv 25) - Hit by Dig (Super Effective).
  - Strategy: Dig landed. Expecting KO. Continue sweeping with Dig.

- **Map 3_13**: Tile (15, 4) is a BREAKABLE ROCK (impassable), despite being TYPE_3fe2. BFS will fail here. Go around via the Left side (Col 4).
- **Map 3_13**: Item at (14, 2) is blocked by Breakable Rock at (15, 4). Requires Rock Smash.
- **Exploration**: Checking bottom-right area (Cols 14-16) before leaving.

  - Progress: Healed team, taught Rock Smash. Now back in Burned Tower.
  - Plan: Smash rock at (15, 4) to access East side/Item. Avoid hole at (7, 15).
  - Hypothesis: Rock Smash opens path to new area or item. Beasts might be elsewhere (B1F center).
- **Loot**: Found HP Up at (14, 2) in Burned Tower 1F.
- **Mapping**: Warp/Hole located at (10, 9) in Burned Tower 1F. Expecting drop to B1F center.

- **Reflection (Turn 14312)**:
  - **Progress**: Released Legendary Beasts, started Ecruteak Gym.
  - **Mistakes**: Used Normal moves on Ghost types (twice). Need to verify immunities.
  - **Strategy**: Switching Garnet out to clear Curse/Paralysis danger. Topaz (Normal/Flying) is immune to Ghost moves.
  - **Gym Maze**: Documenting safe path. Pitfall at (7, 13).
  - **Next**: Defeat Sage Ping, then heal if needed.
