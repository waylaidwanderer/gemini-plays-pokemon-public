# Strategy: Trigger Suicune Sighting (Started: Turn 51131, Turn 51348 - Refined Plan)
- City Logic: Vertical walls partition the city. Row 15 and Row 13 are major barriers. Gaps exist at (11, 15) and (8, 13).
- The Center Shortcut (Execution Plan):
  1. Use SURF at (12, 28) to cross the Row 20 water; land at (12, 19).
  2. Walk North to (12, 16), then West to (8, 16).
  3. Walk North through the gap at (8, 13) to (8, 12).
  4. Walk East along Row 12 to (14, 12), then North to (14, 10) for the Suicune sighting.
- Battle Prep: Lead Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion).

# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard traversable tile.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable collision.
- WATER: Traversable only while using SURF.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way passage (South only). Jump FROM ledge to tile below.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way passage (North only). Walk ONTO from south or walk North from it.
- ROCK (Object): Impassable until cleared with ROCK SMASH.

# Discoveries
- Smashed Rocks: (5, 29), (4, 25).
