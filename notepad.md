# Gem's Playbook (Post-Critique)

## Core Strategy & Goals
- **Primary Goal:** Defeat Brock and earn the Boulder Badge.
- **Secondary Goal:** Train the party for the Pewter Gym battle.
- **Tertiary Goal:** Catch a new Pokémon species for the Pokédex.

## Strategic Learnings & Hypotheses
- **Progression Trigger Hypothesis:** Defeating Brock is the trigger to open the path to Route 3. This is my current operating theory after failing to find any other trigger in Pewter City.
- **Efficient Training:** I must switch out Pokémon when their HP is low, not critical. This will prolong training sessions and prevent forced retreats. My training area is Route 2.
- **Tool Usage:** I will use the `pathfinder_agent` for all non-trivial navigation. I will use the `progression_advisor_agent` when I am unsure of my next steps.
