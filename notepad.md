# Current Strategy
## Travel to Kanto
- **Goal:** Reach Magnet Train Station.
- **Location:** Goldenrod Dept. Store (Elevator -> 1F).
- **Status:** Exiting Elevator.
- **Action:** Pressing Down to warp to 1F.
- **Next:** Exit Store -> Magnet Train to Saffron.
- **Lesson (Turn 31721):** HALLUCINATION CHECK. I pressed 'A' thinking I was on 1F, but the screen showed B1F. Always cross-reference "Current Screen Text" with my assumption. Visual confirmation is mandatory before confirming selections.
- **Menu Strategy:** For critical menus (Elevator, Shops), use `press_buttons` exclusively and verify state after EVERY button press. Do not chain inputs.
