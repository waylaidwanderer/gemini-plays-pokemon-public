# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Investigate Mahogany Town (Radio Signal).
- **Secondary Goal:** Find Lance in Mahogany Town.
- **Navigation:** Route 43 -> Mahogany Town (South).

## Quest Log
- **Lake of Rage:**
    - Caught Red Gyarados (QAAGMAQNJW).
    - Met Lance. He revealed a radio broadcast from Mahogany Town is forcing Magikarp to evolve.
    - Lance is heading to Mahogany to investigate.
- **Goldenrod:**
    - Basement of Dept Store is accessible? Need to check Underground.
- **Deliveries:**
    - Kenya (Spearow) with Mail -> Route 31 Fisher (Failed).

## Team Management
- **Party:** Muscle (42), Garnet (28), Lapis (12), Mistral (13), Kenya (11), Belladonna (5).
- **Box 1:** Red Gyarados (30).
- **Idea:** Swap a weak member (Belladonna/Kenya) for Red Gyarados (Water/Flying) for better power?

## World Knowledge
- **Mahogany Town:** Suspicious Mart with locked stairs. Lance's destination.
- **Lake of Rage:** Red Scale obtained.
- **Route 43:** Connects Lake of Rage (North) to Mahogany Town (South). Gatehouse avoids toll.

## Mechanics
- **Fly:** Cycles towns (Up/Down).
- **Hidden Items:** Check suspicious tiles.
- **Menu Navigation:** Cursor remembers position. Verify before pressing A.

## Global Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WARP_CARPET: Map transition.
- STAIRS: Change floor.
- **Mahogany Mart:** Entered. Met Lance (6, 3). He confirmed the radio signal source is here.
    - Suspicious hidden stairs likely at (7, 3).
    - Plan: Talk to Lance to proceed.
- **Security:** Triggered 'Intruder Alert' at (24, 3). Persian Statues at (24, 1) and (24, 5) are sensors. Infinite Rocket Grunt battles will occur until a secret switch is tripped.
- **Hypothesis:** The switch might be on one of the statues or a computer terminal. Testing statue at (24, 1).
- Muscle grew to Lv 43. Replacing Karate Chop with Cross Chop (Power upgrade).
- Observation: Row 4 appears to be a solid wall of blocks (Tiles 20-29).
- Hypothesis: The Warp at (25, 2) is the only way to proceed past the security wall.
