# Current Strategy: Return to Red
- **Timestamp:** Turn 26399 (Jan 7, 2026) [Silver Cave Item Rooms]
- **Status:** Exploring the upper ledge of Item Rooms (3_77).
- **Immediate Goal:** Determine if the ledge at y=4 is jumpable or if this is a dead end.
- **Plan:**
  1. Test jumping DOWN at various x-coordinates along the ledge.
  2. If jumpable, explore lower area.
  3. If not, return to Room 2 via warp (13, 3) and look for another path (e.g., Warp 11, 5).
- **Hypothesis:** This ledge must lead somewhere or contain an item.

# Investigation List
- **Ledge (x, 4):** Testing if traversable.
- **Item Rooms (Main):** Likely the lower area (y>4).

# Tile Mechanics
- **WARP_CARPET_DOWN:** Must step DOWN onto this tile to trigger warp.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** South-facing Ledge. Usually blocks North movement, allows South (jump). Failed at (4, 4).
  - **Path Verification:**
    - Ledge jump expected at (6, 3) -> (6, 4) (Based on summary).
    - Return path: Go East to Col 17, North to Row 0 (Crossing via (16, 0)), West to Col 13, South to Warp.
    - Confirmed Row 0 is traversable FLOOR.
