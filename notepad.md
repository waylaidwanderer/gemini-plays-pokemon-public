# Transit Log: Pewter to Saffron
- **Method:** Fly -> Walk -> Train.
- **Current Leg:** Pewter City -> Route 3.
- **Goal:** Reach Saffron City to take Magnet Train to Johto.
- **Reason:** Fly map navigation to Johto failed.
- **Next Steps:** Traverse Mt. Moon -> Cerulean -> Saffron.

# Route 3 Navigation Plan
- **Success:** Found gap at (7, 5) and accessed Upper Lane (Rows 2-4).
- **Current Status:** On Upper Lane at (7, 4).
- **Verification:** Route 3 Row 2 is blocked at x=24. Row 1 is a solid wall from x=5 to x=24.
- **Verification:** Row 0 is the only through-path, but it is inaccessible from the Upper Lane (x>5) due to the wall at Row 1.
- **Verification:** Lower Lane (Row 10) is a dead end at x=32.
- **Conclusion:** I MUST access Route 3 Row 0/1/2 from the "Upper Left Pocket" (x<5).
- **Constraint:** This pocket is blocked by walls at x=5 and y=5.
- **Solution:** The "Upper Left Pocket" MUST be accessed directly from Pewter City.
- **Action:** Return to Pewter City. Systematically map the Northeast corner (Row 0-4) to find the exit. Ignore previous "blocked" assumptions.
