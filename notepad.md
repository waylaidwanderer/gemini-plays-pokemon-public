# Route 3 Navigation Plan
- **Current Position:** Route 3 (Lower Path).
- **Insight:** Route 3 has two distinct paths separated by walls from Pewter City:
    1. **Upper Path** (Enter from Pewter at y=14): Leads to Mt. Moon Entrance (Row 1).
    2. **Lower Path** (Enter from Pewter at y=18): Leads to blocked areas/dead ends.
- **Correction:** I am currently on the Lower Path. I must return to Pewter City and switch to the Upper Path.
- **Plan:**
  1. Return to Pewter City (Walk Left).
  2. Navigate to (33, 9) in Pewter to bypass the vertical wall at x=34 (Gap at y=8-9).
  3. Re-enter Route 3 from the Upper Lane (y=14).
  4. Traverse Route 3 along the top edge to Mt. Moon.
- **Next Action:** Walk Left to Pewter City.
