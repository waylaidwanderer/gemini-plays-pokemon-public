# Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Acts as a South-facing Ledge (verified). Blocks North movement (cannot pass Up through it).
- **Maze Solution:** The path at (8, 18) connects the West and East sections.
- **Navigation Notes:**
    - East Section access via (9, 18).
    - Wall at (15, 13-9) separates the East corridors.
    - Path North found at x=8 (verified gap at 8, 7).
