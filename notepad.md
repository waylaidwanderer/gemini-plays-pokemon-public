# Suicune Quest
- Status: 16 Badges, Clear Bell in inventory.
- Start Turn (Route 42 Grove): 47288.
- Sighting Progress (Sequential):
    1. Burned Tower (DONE)
    2. Cianwood City (DONE - Confirmed Turn 47347)
    3. Route 42 (Middle Grove) - PENDING (Trigger missed or requires specific approach)
    4. Route 25 (Kanto, near Bill's House) - LOCKED
- Strategy:
    - Sighting order is strictly linear: Burned Tower -> Cianwood -> Route 42 -> Route 25 -> Tin Tower.
    - Suicune stays in the Route 42 grove until approached.
- Backtracking Plan (HOW):
    - Fly to Ecruteak City.
    - Head East through the gatehouse to Route 42.
    - Use Cut on the tree at (24, 13) to enter the grove.
    - Approach the center of the grove (approx. (28, 15)) to trigger Suicune fleeing.
- General Lessons:
    - Route 36 is NOT a Suicune sighting location in Pokemon Crystal.
    - Fly Tool: 'fly_list_navigator_v3_fixed' is now calibrated for Johto (Up increases index).
