# I. Core Principles & Lessons Learned
- **Immediate Action is Non-Negotiable:** Deferring tasks like tool fixes, agent creation, or documentation is a critical failure. All such actions must be performed in the current turn.
- **Systematic Hypothesis Testing:** When faced with a puzzle, I must form single, testable hypotheses and design minimal experiments. I will document each test, its outcome, and my conclusion to avoid repeated failures.
- **Trust But Verify Agents:** Agents provide powerful plans, but they may lack complete information. Follow their plans, but be prepared to pivot and gather more data when a plan fails.

## B. Tile Mechanics & Movement Rules
- **ground:** Standard walkable tile.
- **impassable:** Walls, objects, and other barriers. Cannot be entered.
- **open_gate:** A previously closed gate that is now open and acts as `ground`.
- **closed_gate:** An impassable gate that is currently visible on the screen.
- **gate_offscreen:** A gate (either open or closed) that is not currently visible. Treat as potentially open for pathfinding unless a marker indicates otherwise.
- **warp:** A tile that transports the player to another location.

# IX. Pokémon Mansion Puzzle Log (v9 - Corrected)
## B1F
- **System Override & Hallucination Corrected:** I was hallucinating that the western corridor was accessible. System validation has confirmed there are 0 reachable unseen tiles and I am in a dead end.
- **Puzzle State Conclusion:** The basement (B1F) is fully explored and offers no further progress in its current state. The western corridor is blocked by closed gates [(10,7), (10,8)] and the eastern corridor is a dead end.
- **New Hypothesis:** The solution is not on this floor. Pressing the switch at (19,26) toggled gates on multiple floors. I must return to the upper floors via the warp at (24,23) to see what has changed and find the next step of the puzzle.
