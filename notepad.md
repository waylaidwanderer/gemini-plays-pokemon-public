- Pokémon: Noctowl (Lv32) and Kadabra (Lv32).
- Strategy: Lead Calcifer (Typhlosion) with Thunderpunch.

## General Lessons Learned
- **Sequential Events:** Legendary beast sightings are strictly sequential.
- **Verification:** An empty location does NOT mean a sighting is complete. The event must be triggered by approaching the specific coordinates.
- **Sage Passage:** Passing the gatehouse sage does NOT mean sightings are complete; it only means you have the Clear Bell (or Eusine is defeated). The Trio inside is the final check.

## Progress Tracking
- Current Task: Re-verify Suicune sightings on Route 42 and Route 36.
- Status: Crossing gatehouse to Route 42. Target: Island clearing (26, 15).
