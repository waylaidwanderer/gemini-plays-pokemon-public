# Strategy: Suicune Hunt (Crystal)
- Sequence: 1. Burned Tower (Done) -> 2. Cianwood (Done) -> 3. Route 42 (Current) -> 4. Route 38 -> 5. Route 14 -> 6. Tin Tower 1F.
- Objective: Trigger Sighting 3 on Route 42 island.
- Hypothesis: Trigger requires approaching from a specific direction (possibly from the water) or standing on a specific tile not yet hit.
- Lessons Learned:
    - Pokedex Navigation: Alphabetical (A-Z). Suicune is after Sudowoodo.
    - Scripted vs Roaming: Suicune is scripted until Sighting 5. Pokedex AREA is the source of truth.
    - Menu Rule: If a menu check takes more than 3 turns, exit and use a tool or move on.
