# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Timestamp:** Turn 25784 (Jan 6, 2026)
- **Primary Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Immediate Task:** Explore Silver Cave Room 1 (Northern Section).
- **Sequence:**
    1. Navigate North to (8, 4) to bypass the wall at x=6.
    2. Go West to (4, 4), then South to (4, 8).
    3. Retrieve Item Ball at (4, 9).
    4. Resume North exploration (check x=8, y<4).

# Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Acts as a South-facing Ledge (verified). Blocks North movement.
- **Maze Solution:** The path at (8, 18) connects the West and East sections.
- **Navigation Notes:**
    - Wall at x=6 separates the path I am on from the item ball.
    - Crossing point appears to be at Row 4.
