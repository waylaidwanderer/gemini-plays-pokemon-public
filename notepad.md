- **Plan:**
    1. Navigate to the Radio Tower entrance (approx. 3, 20 area or further north).
    2. Attempt to enter or talk to guards.
    3. If blocked, search for the "Director" or a Uniform source (likely in Underground or hidden room).

## Key Information
- **Turn 12001:** Rocket Grunt at (31, 10) is a non-battling blocker.
- **Underground:** "No Entry" door at (18, 6) requires a key or switch.

## Reflections (Turn 12001)
- **Execution:** Good immediate responses.
- **Hygiene:** Notepad cleaned up. Grunt behavior noted.
- **Goals:** Clear outcome-focused goals.
- **Hypothesis:** Uniform is needed. If not on a Grunt, maybe it's in the locked room or with a specific NPC I missed.
