## Mechanics Log
- **Mail:** Prevents deposit. PC Full -> Mail goes to Bag. Must hold nothing to attach.
- **Tiles:** WALL, TREES (Cut), WATER (Surf), WHIRLPOOL, WATERFALL.
- **Inputs:** Pressing Start in Mail menu triggers Printer Error. Use B.
- **Timestamp:** Turn 9714. Attempting "DARK CAVE" delivery.
- **Lesson:** Pressing 'Start' in the Mail menu causes a "Printer Error" loop or crash behavior. Use 'B' to exit or 'END' to finish.
- **Correction:** Turn 9715 - Cursor appeared to reset to 'é' or wasn't on 'END'. Re-navigating to 'END' (Bottom-Right) to confirm.
- **Correction:** Turn 9716 - Accidentally typed 'D' due to cursor misalignment. Pressing 'B' to delete, then manually navigating to 'END' (Bottom-Right).
- **Correction:** Turn 9717 - Removing extra 'D'. Navigating Down to 'DEL', pressing A, then moving to 'END'.
