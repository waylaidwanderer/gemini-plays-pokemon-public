# Mechanics & State
- **Fly Mechanics:** Blocked on door mats. Safe spot: (29,6).
- **Menu State:** Cursor on **Garnet** (Slot 4).
- **Party Navigation:** Mistral (Slot 6) is Down x2 from Garnet.
- **Map Navigation:** Cherrygrove -> Violet (Up).
- **Correction:** Previous failure was due to blind navigation assuming cursor was on Mistral. It was actually on Mistral, but I moved UP.

# Strategy
1. Navigate Party: Down x2 (to Mistral).
2. Select Mistral (A) -> Select Fly (A).
3. Map: Wait 5s -> Up -> Wait 1s -> A.
4. Land in Violet City.
