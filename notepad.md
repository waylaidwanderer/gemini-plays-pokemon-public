### Strategic Reflection (Turn 8719)
- **Status**: Stuck in Goldenrod for ~100 turns.
- **Issue**: Oscillating between East/West without clearing the "fog of war".
- **Insight**: The North-East (Flower Shop) is a cul-de-sac. The Central North Wall seems solid. The only remaining option is the North-West quadrant, which is largely "unseen".
- **Action Plan**: 
    1. Return to Main Street (y=10).
    2. Move West to x=6.
    3.Systematically explore North from there, hugging the West edge.

### Navigation Notes
- **Location**: Goldenrod City (Central).
- **Goal**: Reach South Side (Tracks).
- **Status**: Rerouting around blocking Officer at (18, 10).
- **Plan**: 
    1. Go North to (17, 9) and East to (20, 9) to bypass Officer.
    2. Go South to (20, 14).
    3. Cross Tracks at (18, 14).
    4. Head to Underground Entrance at (11, 29).
- **New Strategy**: The Route 35 Exit is likely accessed via the Underground (finding a North-West exit instead of the East one).

### Quest Chain: SquirtBottle
1. **Defeat Whitney**: Done (Plain Badge obtained).
2. **Find Floria**: Currently seeking at Route 36.
3. **Get Bottle**: Return to Flower Shop after meeting Floria.

### Key Locations
- **Underground Ent**: (11, 29).
- **East Crossing**: (18, 14).
- **Radio Tower**: (5, 15).
