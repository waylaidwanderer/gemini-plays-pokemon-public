# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Cross the whirlpool to reach the Dragon Shrine.

# Key Mechanics & Lessons
- **Field Moves:** If 'A' interaction fails (even when facing correctly), ALWAYS fallback to Menu -> Pokemon -> [Mon] -> [Move].
- **Whirlpool:** Requires facing the whirlpool tile directly. 'A' button might be unreliable; Menu is safer.

- Status: Testing direct interaction ('A') with Whirlpool.
- Reason: Menu text was empty, suggesting menu didn't open or isn't visible. Facing is correct (DOWN). 'A' interaction is the standard method. 'B' ensures menu is closed first.
- Step 1: Press 'B' to ensure menu is closed.
- Step 2: Press 'A' to interact with the whirlpool.
