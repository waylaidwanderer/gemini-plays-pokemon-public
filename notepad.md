# Battle Log
- **Vs Will:** Won (Muscle swept).
- **Vs Koga:**
  - **Ariados:** Defeated (Strength).
  - **Venomoth:** Defeated (Strength).
  - **Crobat:** Current opponent.
    - **Status:** Muscle (Full HP) vs Crobat (Full HP).
    - **Cursor:** On PACK.
    - **Action:** Select FIGHT -> Strength.
    - **Plan:** Strength is neutral. Crobat is fast/flying. Tank hit, hit back.
- **Turn 19217:** Muscle attacked Crobat (Strength).
- **Result:** Hit despite Double Team. Crobat at ~50% HP.
- **Opponent Action:** Crobat used Double Team (Evasion +1).
- **Current State:** Muscle (Full HP) vs Crobat (Yellow HP, +1 Evasion).
- **Action:** Up (Select FIGHT) -> A (Select) -> A (Strength).
- **Plan:** Finish it off. High level difference mitigates evasion luck.
- **Turn 19217 Outcome:** Crobat used Wing Attack (Super Effective). Muscle missed (Evasion).
- **Status:** Muscle 152/205 HP. Crobat ~50% HP (from T19216 hit).
- **Turn 19218:** Muscle uses Strength.
- **Reasoning:** Dig fails vs Flying. Fighting moves resisted. Strength is best option.
- **Risk:** Another miss or Confuse Ray. Muscle has HP to spare.
- **Turn 19219:** Strength is out of PP (0/15)!
- **Crisis:** Main damage source is gone. Dig is useless vs Flying. Cross Chop/Rock Smash are resisted (0.25x).
- **Solution:** Use **Max Ether** on Strength.
- **Action:** B (Exit Move Menu) -> Down (Select Pack) -> A (Open Pack).
- **Next:** Find Max Ether -> Restore Strength PP.
- **Turn 19221:** Using Max Ether.
- **Action:** Up (Select Max Ether) -> A (Select) -> A (Use).
- **Target:** Muscle -> Strength.
- **Reason:** Restore PP to continue sweeping.
- **Turn 19222:** Applying Max Ether to Strength.
- **Action:** A (Select Muscle) -> A (Select Strength).
- **Result:** Strength PP fully restored.
- **Next:** Return to Battle -> Use Strength on Crobat.
- **Turn 19223:** Backing out of menus.
- **Action:** B x4 (Close text -> Exit Move Select -> Exit Party -> Exit Bag).
- **Goal:** Return to Battle Menu.
- **Next:** Select FIGHT -> Strength.
- **Turn 19224:** Strength PP restored.
- **Action:** Up (Select FIGHT) -> A (Select) -> A (Select Strength).
- **Status:** Muscle Poisoned. Crobat Full HP.
- **Strategy:** Strength is the only viable move. Keep attacking.
- **Turn 19225:** Muscle used Strength (Turn 19224).
- **Opponent Action:** Crobat used Double Team (Evasion +2).
- **Status:** Muscle 140/205 (Badly Poisoned). Crobat ~40% HP.
- **Action:** Use Strength again.
- **Reasoning:** Must breakthrough evasion.
- **Risk:** Toxic damage ramping up. Crobat might heal again.
- **Turn 19226:** Crobat defeated. Muscle grew to Lv 63.
- **Incoming:** Forretress (Lv 43).
- **Action:** Decline switch (Down -> A).
- **Matchup:** Muscle (Physical) vs Forretress (High Def).
- **Type Analysis:** Bug/Steel.
  - Fire: 4x (Garnet is underleveled).
  - Fighting: 1x (Neutral).
  - Ground: 1x (Neutral).
  - Normal: 0.5x (Resisted).
- **Plan:** Use Cross Chop or Dig. Muscle is best bet despite high enemy Def.
- **Turn 19228 Analysis:** Forretress used Protect. Muscle used Rock Smash (Input error: assumed cursor reset to 1, but was at 4. 4->Down x3->3 Rock Smash).
- **Correction:** Cursor is now on Slot 3 (Rock Smash).
- **Turn 19229:** Muscle (29/208 HP, Toxic) vs Forretress (Full HP).
- **Strategy:** Use Cross Chop (Slot 4). Strongest neutral move.
- **Action:** Smart Move (Current: 3, Target: 4).
- **Risk:** Miss (80% acc) or survival. Muscle likely faints after this turn due to Poison.
- **Turn 19230:** Muscle fainted (Poison damage).
- **Status:** Forretress at Full HP (Protected last turn).
- **Action:** Switch to Gyarados (Slot 3).
- **Reasoning:** Gyarados (Lv 35) is tankier than Garnet (Lv 29). Surf is special (hits lower SpDef). Fire (Garnet) is 4x effective but too risky due to low level/defense.
- **Plan:** Use Surf. Recover momentum. Revive Muscle later if needed.
- **Turn 19231:** Switched to Gyarados.
- **Turn 19232:** Gyarados active.
- **Action:** Use Surf (Slot 4).
- **Reasoning:** STAB, Special attack vs Forretress (Lower SpDef).
- **Risk:** Explosion. Gyarados is best tank available.
- **Turn 19233:** Forretress defeated. Muk incoming.
- **Action:** Decline Switch (Down -> A).
- **Plan:** Use Revive on Muscle immediately. Gyarados tanks a hit.
- **Reasoning:** Gyarados can survive one hit. Muscle (Dig) is needed to kill Muk efficiently. Mistral sack is risky if Muk attacks on switch-in.
- **Turn 19234:** Opening Pack.
- **Goal:** Revive Muscle.
- **Context:** Muk active. Gyarados active.
- **Next:** Find Revive -> Use on Muscle.
