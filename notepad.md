### Quest Log

- [9544] The 'Back Door' at (20, 29) is locked/inaccessible. Retrying Underground.
- [9542] Discovery: Underground Exit (21, 25) leads to a sealed 'Backyard'.
- [9590] CONFIRMED: Goldenrod Underground has side exits to enclosed 'Backyards'. The main City entrances/exits are at (11, 29) [South] and (9, 5) [North]. To traverse the city, use these.
[9651] Reflection:
- Progress: Good exploration of Goldenrod. Need to find the path North to Route 35. The layout around Row 4/5 is confusing (block of walls).
- Strategy: The direct path North from the West side is blocked. Move East past the Gym (Row 7, Col 24) and navigate through the open area around Col 30-35 to reach the North exit (Route 35).
- Hygiene: Map and Notepad are in good shape.
- Tool Failure: 'bfs_navigate' failed to find a path to (16, 2), confirming the direct path is blocked. Manual exploration required.
