## Core Principles & Strategy
- **Immediate Execution:** Perform tasks the moment they are identified.
- **Scientific Method:** Observe -> Hypothesize -> Test -> Conclude.
- **Efficiency:** Running from wild battles is preferred unless training or catching.

## Menu Mechanics
- **Pokegear:** 3 clicks down from POKEDEX in the Start menu.
- **Radio:** Frequency 20.0 (Poke Flute) is at the very top of the dial in Kanto. Requires EXPN Card upgrade. Set once, stays until changed.

## Party & PC Management
- **Lead Pokémon:** Calcifer (TYPHLOSION Lv58).
- **HM Users:** KIMCHI (FLASH, CUT), GNEISS (STRENGTH), LAPIS (SURF, WHIRLPOOL, WATERFALL), ICARUS (FLY).

## Kanto Progression Tracking
- **Magnet Train:** Operational.
- **EXPN Card:** Obtained from Lavender Radio Tower (Turn 40164).
- **Snorlax Roadblock:** Route 11 west end. Requires Poke Flute to wake. Interaction tile: (35, 8).

## Snorlax Quest Phase

- Interaction tile: (36, 8) facing Left.
- Status: Positioned at (36, 8) facing Left (Turn 40362).
- Method: Use Pokegear Radio (Frequency 20.0 - Poke Flute) to wake him.
- Radio Status: Unverified (Assume tuning required).
- Swap Plan: Lead with XENON (Haunter) for Normal immunity and Hypnosis.
- Menu Sequence (Swap): Start -> Down (PKMN) -> A -> Down x2 (Xenon) -> Select -> Up x2 (Calcifer) -> Select -> B.
- Menu Sequence (Radio): Start -> Down x3 (Gear) -> A -> Right (Radio) -> Up (hold for 20.0) -> B x2.
- Interaction: Face Left from (36, 8) and press A.
- Start Turn: 40317.

## General Lessons & Error Log
