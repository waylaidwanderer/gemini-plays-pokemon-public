# Strategy: Trigger Suicune Sighting (Started: Turn 51131)
- City Logic: The city is divided into vertical corridors. The Western Corridor (X=2) is the primary land path to the north (Row 12). Row 51 is the primary southern connector. Gaps in vertical walls: X=9 (Row 33, Row 44), X=5 (Row 35, Row 51), X=3 (Row 51). X=10/11 is blocked at Row 40.
- Execution Plan:
  1. Walk South to (12, 44) to bypass building at (10, 40).
  2. Continue South to Row 51.
  3. Hike North through X=2 to reach Suicune.
- Battle Prep: Lead Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion).
