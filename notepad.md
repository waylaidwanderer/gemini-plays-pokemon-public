# Ice Path Strategy
- **Current Action:** Reached West Section (Safe Ground).
- **Goal:** Find ladder to B1F.
- **Hypothesis:** Ladder is likely in the North-West area (explored from x=13, y=16).
- **Warp Note:** (4, 19) is marked "To Route 44". If valid, this is the **Entrance**. Do not exit.
- **Items:** Item Balls at (32, 23), (35, 9), (31, 7) [East Side - Unreachable from here].

# Mechanics & Lessons
- **Ice Physics:** Sliding continues until collision.
- **Ledges:** `FLOOR_UP_WALL` tiles are impassable.
- **Map Structure:** 
  - East: Entrance/Start? (Wait, checking map).
  - Center: Ice Maze (Solved).
  - West: Progression to B1F?

# Path History
- Slid: (20,23) -> (18,23) -> (18,20) -> (14,20) -> (14,16).
- Walking Left to (13,16) to exit ice.
