- **Primary Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Immediate Task:** Challenge Red.
- **Sequence:**
    1. Save the game (optional but good practice).
    2. Approach Red at (9, 10).
    3. Interact to start the final battle.
- **Red Found:** He is standing at (9, 10) in Silver Cave Room 3.
- **Preparation:** Muscle (Machoke Lv83) is the primary carry. Support team is weak. Reliance on items (Revives, Potions) will be heavy if Muscle faints.

# Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Acts as a South-facing Ledge (verified). Blocks North movement.
- **Warp Carpet:** Located at Row 29/31. Avoid stepping on them unless exiting.
- **Waterfalls:** Found at Row 28/29. Requires HM07 Waterfall.
- **Waterfall Mechanics:** Walking into a waterfall causes a slide-back, setting facing to DOWN. To ascend, ensure facing UP (move away and back if needed) then press A to interact. Requires HM07.
- **Tile Mechanics Update:** `FLOOR_UP_WALL` at Row 4 blocked South movement. Treating as impassable for now.
- **Map Structure:** Upper Ledge is segmented. Center (13) connects to Left (6), but Right (17) is blocked by Wall at Col 16.
