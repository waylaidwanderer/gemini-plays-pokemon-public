# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Standard ground. Traversable.
- WATER: Surf required. Traversable.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- WALL: Impassable ground/object.
- DOOR: Warp point. Traversable.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable ledge face. Blocks South movement.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).

# Strategy: Reach Suicune (The Northern Sea Approach)
- Start Turn: 48227 (Pursuit began), 48543 (Current strategy)
- Step 1: Walk to (19, 30) and Surf at (20, 30).
- Step 2: Surf East to (27, 30), then North to (27, 10).
- Step 3: West through Gap 1 at (26, 10) to (23, 10).
- Step 4: North to (23, 8), then West through Gap at (22, 8) to (14, 8).
- Step 5: South to (14, 10) and land on the northern plateau.
- Note: This path uses the high-latitude gaps to bypass all buoy barriers and land directly at the sighting spot. Ready for Eusine battle after Suicune flees.

# Area Notes: Cianwood City
- Photo Studio: (9, 31)
- Poke Seer: (5, 17)
- Pharmacy: (15, 47)
- Gym: (8, 43)
- Breakable Rocks: (5, 29), (8, 16), (9, 17), (10, 27), (4, 19), (4, 25)

# General Lessons
- Buoy layouts in water channels often create dead-end pockets (e.g., Row 10 in Cianwood). Always verify the northern/southern exits before committing.
- City layouts with many ledges (like Cianwood) are best navigated by finding a perimeter path rather than cutting through the center.
- `FLOOR_UP_WALL` tiles typically block movement in one direction (usually South in this region). Document verified directions in the Tile Mechanics section.
