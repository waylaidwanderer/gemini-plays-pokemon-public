# Strategic Goals
1. **Wake Snorlax:** Needs Poke Flute (EXPN Card obtained) & Power.
   - *Status:* In Pokedex (accidentally). Resetting to Gear.
   - *Action:* Exit Pokedex -> Open Gear -> Tune Radio (Ch 20) -> Wake Snorlax.
   - *Correction:* Detected accidental Pokedex entry. Exiting and selecting Gear properly.
   - *Next:* Tune Radio.
2. **Collect Badges:** Thunder (Done), Marsh (Done).

# Mechanics & Discoveries
- **EXPN Card:** Hidden upgrade to Pokegear. Validated.
- **Snorlax:** Located at (34, 8) in Vermilion City. Blocks Diglett's Cave.

# Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Blocked from North.
- **WARP_CARPET_DOWN:** Walk off map edge.
- **Ledge:** Jump down (South) only.

# Active Quests
- **Bill's Grandpa:** Wants Lickitung.
- **Repel active:** Turn 22378 (Max Repel)

# Lessons Learned
- **Verification:** Always verify possession of Key Items (like EXPN Card) in the inventory before attempting to use them. Do not assume they were acquired during story events.
- **Troubleshooting:** If a mechanic (like the Radio) fails, check the prerequisites (Key Items) first before blaming the mechanics (tuning).
- **Route 8:** Underground Path is closed (shut down by police). Bikers control the surface road.
- **Radio Tuning:** Must press 'A' to enter the Radio module before tuning works. Cursor position alone is insufficient.
- **Menu Navigation:** Start menu cursor wraps and remembers position. Double check cursor starting point.

# Reflection (Turn 22694)
- **Execution:** No deferred tasks. Fixed EXPN card oversight immediately.
- **Notepad:** Organized. Added "Lessons Learned".
- **Map:** Markers are accurate. Snorlax marked.
- **Tools:** Pathfinding and Battle tools are performing well.
- **Goals:** Clear. Wake Snorlax -> Diglett's Cave.
- **Errors:** Radio tuning failure analyzed and corrected. Inventory assumption corrected.
