# Strategy: The Suicune Pursuit
- **Objective:** Trigger Suicune sighting at (14, 10) in northern Cianwood.
- **Eusine Battle Prep:** Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25). Strategy: Lead with Lv64 Calcifer. Sweep with Flamethrower/Thunderpunch.
- **Current Plan (The Central Path):**
  1. Currently at (11, 47).
  2. Move North to (12, 47) then North to (12, 28) (Bypassing Terrace Climb at (12, 30)).
  3. Option A (Surf): Surf from (12, 28) to (12, 12) then walk to (14, 10).
  4. Option B (Land): Walk (12, 28) -> (11, 28) -> (11, 23) -> (9, 23) -> (9, 21) -> (11, 21) -> (11, 15) -> (10, 14) -> (10, 12) -> (14, 10).
- **Contingency:** If central path fails at (11, 15), use Surf from (12, 28).

# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Standard traversable terrain.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable terrain.
- WATER: Traversable only with Surf.
- DOOR / WARP_CARPET: Map transition points.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump down (South). Blocks North.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL (Terrace Climb): One-way barrier. Allows North movement, blocks South.
- ROCK (Object): Blocks movement; cleared with Rock Smash. Respawns upon map transition.

# Area Notes: Cianwood City
- **Barriers:** (4, 23) is a WALL. (4, 30), (6, 34), (6, 46) are Terrace Climbs (North only).
- **Smashed Rocks:** (5, 29), (4, 25), (4, 19), (9, 17), (8, 16).
- **Dead Ends:** (11, 15) is a pocket blocked by a ledge.

# Lessons Learned
- **Time Check:** Attempting sighting since Turn #50620.
- **Verification:** X=2 corridor confirmed clear of Terrace Climbs in Mental Map.
