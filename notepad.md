# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Standard ground. Traversable.
- WATER: Surf required. Traversable.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- WALL: Impassable ground/object.
- DOOR: Warp point. Traversable.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable ledge face. Blocks South movement.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).

# Strategy: Reach Suicune (The Central Pool Approach)
- Start Turn: 48227 (Pursuit began), 48539 (Current strategy)
- Step 1: Surf at (14, 28) to (14, 27).
- Step 2: Surf North to (15, 24).
- Step 3: East to (17, 24) via gap at (16, 24).
- Step 4: North to Row 11, then West to land at (16, 11).
- Step 5: Walk to Suicune sighting spot at (14, 10).
- Note: This path uses the gap at (16, 24) to move from the central pool to the eastern channel, bypassing the buoy walls at Row 15 and Row 25. Verified (16, 11) as a landing spot.

# Area Notes: Cianwood City
- Photo Studio: (9, 31)
- Poke Seer: (5, 17)
- Pharmacy: (15, 47)
- Gym: (8, 43)
- Breakable Rocks: (5, 29), (8, 16), (9, 17), (10, 27), (4, 19), (4, 25)

# General Lessons
- Buoy layouts in water channels often create dead-end pockets (e.g., Row 10 in Cianwood). Always verify the northern/southern exits before committing.
- City layouts with many ledges (like Cianwood) are best navigated by finding a perimeter path rather than cutting through the center.
- `FLOOR_UP_WALL` tiles typically block movement in one direction (usually South in this region). Document verified directions in the Tile Mechanics section.
