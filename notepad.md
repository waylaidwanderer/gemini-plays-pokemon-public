# Suicune Strategy (Crystal Version)

    1. Burned Tower flee event. (COMPLETED)
    2. Cianwood City overworld encounter. (COMPLETED)
    3. Route 42 middle island encounter. (COMPLETED)
    4. Defeat Wise Trio at Tin Tower Entrance building. (COMPLETED)
    5. Possess Clear Bell. (COMPLETED)
- Current Status: Suicune is in Ecruteak City (Pokedex confirmed). Stationary battle expected.
- Battle Plan: Hypnosis -> weaken. Suicune is level 40. Moves: Rain Dance, Gust, Aurora Beam, Mist.
- Team: XENON (Gastly) for Sleep, GNEISS (Graveler) for tanking.

# Tin Tower Investigation
- Current Status: Suicune is stationary in Tin Tower (Tracker/Pokedex), but 1F trigger is missing.
- Strategy Pivot: Search Ecruteak City for Eusine or missed dialogue triggers.
- Hypothesis: Trigger for Suicune's overworld appearance on 1F is external to the tower (e.g. Wise Trio's final blessing or Eusine's intervention).
- Task 1: Fly to PC, check for Eusine.
- Task 2: Navigate to Tin Tower Entrance (18, 11) and talk to Wise Trio.
- Note: Sages are not vanishing; (10, 2) is a standard FLOOR tile for now.
