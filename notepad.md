# Strategy: Suicune Hunt (Johto)
- Objective: Trigger scripted flee event (Sighting 3) on Route 42 island.
- Status: Sprite missing. Pokedex AREA verification required.
- Strategy: If Pokedex shows Route 42, explore water around the island. If Route 38, move to Moomoo Farm.
- Lessons Learned:
    - Pokedex: Alphabetical (A-Z). Suicune follows Sudowoodo.
    - Scripted: Sighting sequence is fixed. Pokedex AREA map tracks the current scripted location.
    - Animation: Sprite flees with a visible jump. If no jump seen, event is not complete.
