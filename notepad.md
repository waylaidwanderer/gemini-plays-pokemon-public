# Suicune Battle Plan
- Item: QUICK CLAW (Priority: National Park).
- Turn 1: MEAN LOOK.
- Turn 2+: HYPNOSIS.
- Turn 3+: NIGHT SHADE (fixed damage).
- Failsafe 1: Suicune has ROAR. Even with Mean Look, Roar will end the battle. Need to keep it asleep or use a Pokémon with Soundproof (not in Crystal) or Suction Cups (Octillery - not available yet). Strategy: Prioritize Sleep.
