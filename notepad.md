# Current Strategy: Return to Red
- **Timestamp:** Turn 26121 (Jan 7, 2026) [Reflected]
- **Primary Goal:** Defeat Red.
- **Status:** Navigating to Reception Gate via the lower grass path and the gap at (14, 9).
- **Route:** (31, 2) -> South to Row 10 -> West to x=14 -> North through gap at (14, 9) -> Gate at (13, 5).
- **Reasoning:** Validated that the gap at (14, 9) allows Northward movement, bypassing the ledges blocking direct access from the south. The path requires looping south around the water.
- **Money:** ¥3,833.
- **Inventory:** 15 Full Restores, 19 Revives.
- **Immediate Goal:** Walk West to Route 22 -> Reception Gate -> Silver Cave.
- **Plan:**
    1. Walk to Route 22.

# Recent Discoveries
- Found Max Revive at (6, 3) in the isolated Left Section of the Item Room.

# Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Acts as a South-facing Ledge (verified). Blocks North movement.
- **Warp Carpet:** Located at Row 29/31. Avoid stepping on them unless exiting.
- **Waterfall Mechanics:** Walking into a waterfall causes a slide-back, setting facing to DOWN. To ascend, ensure facing UP (move away and back if needed) then press A to interact. Requires HM07.

# Map Structure (Silver Cave)
- Upper Ledge is segmented. Center (13) connects to Left (6), but Right (17) is blocked by Wall at Col 16.
- **Route 2 Navigation:** To head North from the entrance, use the gap in the ledge at (7, 47). The tree at (10, 40) blocks the path further North.
