# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL / WINDOW: Impassable.
- COUNTER: Impassable; interact with NPC behind it from adjacent tile.
- MART_SHELF: Impassable.
- LADDER: Two-way warp.
- PIT: One-way warp to floor below.
- WARP_CARPET_DOWN: Exit warp.
- WATER: Traversable only while using Surf. Requires a Pokémon with the move Surf and the Fog Badge (obtained from Morty).
- BUOY: Impassable water barrier. Verified at (13, 32) in Olivine City and (19, 14-17) on Route 40.

# Lessons Learned
- Ecruteak Gym Path: (3,9)->(3,7)->(6,7)->(6,5)->(7,5)->Martha; (6,5)->(5,5)->(5,1)->Morty.
- Moomoo Farm: Sick Miltank needs 7 standard BERRY items.
- Section Connectivity: 4F sections connected by gaps at y=2/3 (East-Middle) and y=14 (Middle-West).
- Warp Verification: (16, 7) and (17, 7) on 4F are NOT map transitions; (18, 7) is a WALL.
- Descent Strategy: Use pits to quickly reach lower floors. 4F (16, 9)/(17, 9) are PITs to 3F.
- Visuals vs. Collision: Visual appearance of tiles (e.g., ground vs wall) can be misleading. Always verify collision types in the Mental Map (e.g., WALL type) before planning paths. (Turn 5863)
- Olivine Harbor: Enclosed by buoys at Y=32. This is a dead end for reaching Route 40. (Turn 5911)

# Berry Knowledge
- Mint (R39), Bitter (R31), Mystery (R35), Ice (R36).

# Map Notes
