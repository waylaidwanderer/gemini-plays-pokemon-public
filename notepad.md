# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH. Allows NORTH. Verified: Down at (10, 47) failed (Turn 49611).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH. Found at Row 15 (X=3-17).
- ROCK: Smashable rocks act as WALLs. (4, 19), (4, 25), (5, 29), (8, 16), (9, 17), (10, 27).
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 9, 11, 17.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
## Strategy: Western Corridor Ascent
Reach (14, 10) via Western Corridor (X=0-2) to bypass the Row 15 ledge.
1. Move to (12, 44). <- CURRENT TASK
2. Move West to (6, 44) via gap at (9, 44).
3. Move North to (6, 35) and West to (2, 35) via gap at (5, 35).
4. Walk North along X=2 to Row 12.
5. Walk East to (14, 12) and North to (14, 10).

# Progress Notes
- Attempted 'Great Southern Loop' but blocked by FLOOR_UP_WALL ledges.
- Attempted 'Surf Bypass' but blocked by wild encounters and long travel.
- Western Corridor at X=2 remains the most viable land path.
- Dead End Pocket: (12-19, 46-49) blocks South/West exit at Row 49/50. Must exit via Row 46 or Row 45.
