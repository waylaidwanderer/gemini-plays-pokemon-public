# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Cross the whirlpool to reach the Dragon Shrine.

# Key Mechanics & Lessons
- **Field Moves:** If 'A' interaction fails (even when facing correctly), ALWAYS fallback to Menu -> Pokemon -> [Mon] -> [Move].
- **Whirlpool:** Requires facing the whirlpool tile directly. 'A' button might be unreliable; Menu is safer.

- Status: Correcting Party Menu selection to Lapis.
- Reason: Cursor started on Lapis (remembered position) and I moved Down twice to Kunai. Need to go back Up.
- Step 1: Press 'Up' twice to return to Lapis (Slot 3).
- Step 2: Press 'A' to open the sub-menu.
