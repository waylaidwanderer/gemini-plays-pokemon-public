# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Strategy & Pathing
- **Goal:** Reach Azalea Town (West of Route 33).
- **Current Task:** Defeat Hiker Anthony.
- **Battle Status:** Healing Unakite (Potion).
- **Strategy:** Unakite must tank Low Kick (low weight = low dmg). Onix would be one-shot (heavy weight = high dmg + SE).
- **Hope:** Machop uses a non-damaging move (Leer) or Hidden Power is strong.
- **Map Notes:**
    - **Route 32:** North.
    - **Union Cave 1F:** Current. Exit at (17, 31).
    - **Route 33:** South.
- **Mechanics:**
    - `FLOOR_UP_WALL` ledges define the reachable zones.
    - **Gen 2 Battle:** Potion heals 20HP.
    - **Low Kick:** Destroys heavy Pokémon (Onix). Unown takes less damage due to weight.

## Party
- **GARNET (Quilava)** Lv18 (FNT) | **TOPAZ (Sentret)** Lv4 | **EGG** | **UNAKITE (Unown)** Lv5 (9/20 HP -> Will be 20/20) | **ROCKY (Onix)** Lv10 (14/28 HP)

## Quest Log
