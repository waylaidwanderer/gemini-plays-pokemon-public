# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026
- Current Location: Goldenrod Flower Shop (Map 10_14)

### Immediate Goals
1. **Find Floria**: Explore the North-East corner of the National Park.
2. **Find Exit to Route 36**: Likely in the North-East.
3. **Get SquirtBottle**: Return to Flower Shop after finding Floria.

### Quest Log
- **Badges**: Zephyr, Hive, Plain.
- **Party**: All Healthy.
- **Mail Quest**: Active.
- **Contest**: Not entered (lack of Sport Balls/Bug Catching logic).

### Strategic Notes
- **SquirtBottle**: Need to talk to Floria to progress.
- **Current Location**: Route 36 / National Park East (Map 10_3).
- **Goal**: Find Floria.
- **Plan**:
  1. Check "Schoolboy Alan" at (26, 6) -> Checked. Just printing Pokedex.
  2. Scan North-East area of National Park.
  3. Check for any other NPCs in the northern section.
- **Status**: Inside Flower Shop. Attempting to talk to Girl at (6,4)/(6,3).
- **Plan**:
  1. Interact with Girl.
  2. If no SquirtBottle, confirm Floria's location.
  3. Talk to Lady at (3,2) as backup.
  4. If directed, search National Park / Route 36 East for Floria.
- **Note**: Psychic at (5, 11) was unresponsive or silent.
### Tile Types
- **TYPE_3fe2**: Walkable Ground/Grass (Safe)
- **TYPE_2889**: Obstacle (Wall/Tree)
- **TYPE_3f8d**: Tall Grass (Wild Encounters, Safe)
- **TYPE_fed7**: Mixed (Benches/Obstacles & Gaps). Avoid for BFS if possible.
- **TYPE_f871**: Warp/Gatehouse Door
- **Reflection**: East Gate issue was likely poor positioning. Successfully exited to Route 36.
- **Current Task**: Talking to NPC at (14, 4) for info.
- **Dialogue Log**: Girl says "I heard it became wild when someone..." (likely watered it). This confirms the mechanic but I still need the item.
- **Observation**: Exited Flower Shop via back door to Map 10_2 (9, 33). This is likely the East side of Route 35. Heading North to see if I can cross to National Park or Route 36.
