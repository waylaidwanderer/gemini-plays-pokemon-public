4. Silver Cave
5. New Bark Town
6. Cherrygrove City

# Hypothesis: Missing Indigo Plateau
- Indigo Plateau is not appearing in the Johto cycle.
- Potential reasons: Region map switch required, or Fly point not registered.
- Test: Press 'Select' on Fly map to attempt region switch if 'Right' continues to fail.

# Lessons Learned
- Roamers move on map transitions.
- Fly map cursor starts at current location.
- Fly tool: Use Pokemon menu -> FLY move for better reliability.
