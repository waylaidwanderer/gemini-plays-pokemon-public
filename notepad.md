# Strategic Notes
## Objectives
- **Primary:** Reach Indigo Plateau (Money Farming Loop).
- **Secondary:** Defeat Elite Four.
- **Tertiary:** Hunt Roamers (Raikou/Entei) - *Paused*.

## Current Task: Explore Victory Road 1F (East)
- **Location:** Victory Road 1F (Southeast) at (19, 55).
- **Goal:** Reach potential Ladder at (17, 49).
- **Reasoning:**
  - 1F West Ladder at (1, 49) leads to a dead end on 2F.
  - 1F East side likely has a matching ladder.
  - Mental Map shows (17, 49) is accessible.
  - Symmetry with (1, 49) suggests a ladder might be there.
  - Row 47 is a solid wall, so I can't go further North on 1F. The path MUST be a ladder in this area.

## Status
- **Money:** ¥3294.
- **Party:** Gyarados (Lead), Lugia, Machoke, Pidgey, Oddish, Quilava.

## Reflection (Turn 32967)
- **Execution:** No deferred tasks identified in the last 50 turns.
- **Hygiene:** Notepad sections are relevant. Map markers are active and accurate.
- **Tools:** Current navigation challenges are due to map topology (vertical stacking), not tool deficiency. Standard `navigate` is sufficient with manual warp handling.
- **Goals:** Primary goal (Indigo Plateau) remains valid. Strategy shifted from 2F West (blocked/bugged ledge) to 1F Southeast (exploration).
- **Lesson:** Victory Road (3_91) is a single map with stacked floors. Navigation tools see it as one continuous area but cannot pathfind through warps automatically. I must manually step off and onto ladders to transition between floors.
- **Plan:** Trigger warp at (1, 35) to return to 1F, then traverse the southern corridor to the East section.
