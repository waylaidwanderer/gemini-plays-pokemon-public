# Suicune Quest Strategy: 'The Triple Gap Loop'
- Goal: Reach Suicune sighting area at (7, 4).
- Fact: Row 15 is a solid land barrier (walls/ledges). Northern water is isolated by interlocking buoy walls.
- Solution: Use the three specific gaps in the buoy walls to reach the north beach.
- Route:
    1. Surf at (19, 30).
    2. Sail to (27, 30) -> (27, 10).
    3. Cross X=26 wall through gap at (26, 10).
    4. Sail to (23, 10) -> (23, 8).
    5. Cross X=22 wall through gap at (22, 8).
    6. Sail to (18, 8) -> (7, 8).
    7. Land and walk to (7, 4).
- Preparation: Lead with XENON (Haunter) for Hypnosis. Be ready for Eusine.
- Status: Closing Tully's call, then starting the loop.
- Attempt 1 (Turn 47669): Tried to Surf and move Right. Failed, stayed at (19, 30).
- Hypothesis 1: Dialogue delay or facing issue.
- Test 2: Face Up (already facing), press A twice to Surf into (19, 29), then move Right.
