# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement. Passable from SOUTH to NORTH. Found at (4, 20), (16, 10), (8, 34).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at (10, 15).
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- Start Turn: 49771
- Start Time: 3:29 PM

## Strategy: The Sea Route Bypass (Final)
The northern plateau (Row 10-14) is protected by a maze of land walls, but accessible via the northern sea.
1. Face Up and Surf at (12, 28) -> (12, 27). (In Progress)
2. Surf North to Row 21.
3. Surf East through the (19, 21) buoy gap.
4. Surf North to Row 15.
5. Surf East through the (23, 15) buoy gap.
6. Surf North to Row 9.
7. Surf East through the (27, 9) buoy gap.
8. Surf North to Row 8, then West to (16, 8).
9. Surf South to (16, 12) to land.
10. Walk to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

## Hypotheses
- H1: (19, 21), (23, 15), and (27, 9) are confirmed gaps in the buoy walls.
- H2: (16, 12) is a valid landing point for the northern plateau.
- H3: (14, 10) is the trigger point for the Suicune sighting.

# Progress Notes
- Reached (12, 28) on Turn 49791.
- Note: SUPER REPEL is active.
- Note: Rock at (4, 25) and Wall at (4, 23) block land access to the Western Corridor from the central pool landing.
- Note: (10, 27) Rock blocks westward movement from (11, 27).
- Note: Sea route avoids all land-based maze obstacles.
