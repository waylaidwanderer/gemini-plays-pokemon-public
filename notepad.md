# Current Objectives
*   **Primary Goal:** Obtain the Boulder Badge from the Pewter City Gym Leader, Brock.
*   **Secondary Goal:** Acquire sufficient funds to heal FLAREE (6/26 HP) and purchase essential supplies. Money: ¥156.
*   **Tertiary Goal:** Reach Route 3 (East Pewter Exit at (40,19)) to battle trainers for funds.

# Pewter City Strategy & Current Plan
*   **Current Location:** (17,19) in Pewter City.
*   **Immediate Goal:** Reach Pewter Pokecenter at (14,26) to heal FLAREE (6/26 HP). See 'Pewter Pokecenter Access' plan below.
*   **Youngster (ID 5) Status:** Currently at (36,17). He triggers an escort event if approached in eastern Pewter City (e.g., from (37,19), (38,19), (30,19)), moving player to (12,19).
*   **Post-Healing Plan for Route 3 (East Pewter Exit at (40,19) - Revised Turn 5596)**:
    *   Current position: (35,30) facing Up. Pikachu at (35,31).
    *   Blockage Update: Tile (35,18) confirmed impassable by `move_validator_agent` despite XML indicating 'ground'. This blocks previous northern approach via Y=18.
    *   The X=36 column is impassable from Y=21 down to Y=32.
    *   **Current Plan (HIGH RISK of Youngster escort):**
        1.  From (35,30), move North to (35,19). (11 steps Up)
        2.  From (35,19), move East to (40,19) (Route 3 exit). Path: (35,19)->(36,19)->(37,19)->(38,19)->(39,19)->(40,19).
        3.  This path directly crosses (36,19), which is adjacent to Youngster (36,17) and likely a trigger zone.
        4.  Consider using `scripted_event_tracker_agent` for the segment from (35,19) eastward if this direct approach fails or to pre-check.
*   **Known Pathing Obstacles in Western/Central Pewter (near Pokecenter/Gym):**
    *   (19,19) - Impassable (blocks eastward movement from Gym area pocket).
    *   (17,18) - Gym Warp.
    *   (17,17) through (17,15) - Impassable (blocks northward movement from (17,19)).
    *   (12,22), (13,22), (14,22), (15,22), (16,22), (17,22) - Impassable (blocks southward movement in X=12-17 range at Y=21).

# Game Mechanics & Strategy Notes
*   **Ledge Mechanics:** One-way (downwards only).
*   **Movement:** 1st press TURNS if not facing, 2nd press MOVES. Pikachu: 1st press turns, 2nd moves if moving *into* his tile and not facing him.
*   **Level Cap:** 0 badges = Lv12.
*   **Map Marker Usage:** 💥 (Confirmed Event Trigger), 🎯 (Drop-off/Key Nav Point), ❗ (Risky Zone/Obstacle), 💁 (Event NPCs), ☠️ (Defeated Trainers), 🏛️ (Building Entrance), 📍 (Key Navigation Point / Start of a new route attempt), 🧱 (Confirmed Impassable Blocker).
*   **Tile Navigability:** The `navigable` property has been removed from map tiles. Navigability must now be inferred from tile `type` (e.g., 'ground' is generally traversable, 'impassable' is not, 'ledge' has specific one-way rules) and the presence of blocking objects/NPCs.

# Party Status
*   SPBARKY (PIKACHU): Lv12 (38/39 HP) (Capped)
*   FLAREE (VULPIX): Lv8 (6/26 HP) - CRITICAL HP.
*   SPROUT (ODDISH): Lv12 (33/37 HP) (Capped)

# Agent Usage Plan (Post-Reflection)
*   **`scripted_event_tracker_agent`:** Use to vet *path segments* (3-5 steps) in eastern Pewter (X > 25) or when near Youngster's current coordinates. Always input Youngster's current sprite coordinates as a dynamic trigger (e.g., radius 3).
*   **`move_validator_agent`:** Use for short, complex pathing segments, especially in western Pewter or when navigating near known obstacles/impassable tiles. Also to validate initial steps of `exploration_planner_agent` paths if used.
*   **`exploration_planner_agent`:** Use for navigating complex/obstructed areas like western Pewter if manual pathing fails repeatedly. Validate its output for initial steps or risky areas.
*   **`potion_purchase_optimizer_agent`:** Use once sufficient funds ( > ¥200) are acquired to heal FLAREE.

# Agent Ideas (Post-Reflection - Turn 5560)
*   **Youngster Event Predictor Agent:** Input: player_pos, player_facing, youngster_pos, youngster_facing, recent_player_path, map_xml. Output: trigger_likelihood (low/medium/high), reasoning, suggested safe_tile to move to next if likelihood is high.
*   **Path Refinement Agent:** Input: A high-level path (sequence of a few key coordinates from `exploration_planner_agent` or manual plan), current player pos/facing, Pikachu pos. Output: Detailed button presses for that segment, considering Pikachu turning rules, and basic obstacle avoidance for 1-2 steps using map_xml.
*   **Money Management/Shopping Agent:** Input: Current money, shopping list (potions, pokeballs), item prices, party status (for potion needs). Output: Optimal purchase plan.

# Hindsight & Lessons Learned (Critique Incorporated)
*   **Pewter City Pathing (General):** Manual pathing has been highly inefficient, especially in western Pewter and for avoiding the Youngster. Must be more systematic:
    1.  Clearly define a multi-step path segment.
    2.  Verify segment against map XML for known impassable tiles.
    3.  If complex/risky, use `move_validator_agent` for the segment.
    4.  If near Youngster, use `scripted_event_tracker_agent` for the segment.
*   **Youngster Event Avoidance:** Repeatedly trying the same approach vectors was ineffective. Must try significantly different routes or approach patterns.
*   **Agent Path Execution:** Must be more careful translating `exploration_planner_agent` coordinate paths to button presses. Validate initial steps. Agent paths can lead to unintended warps.
*   **Notepad Precision:** Ensure `old_text` for `replace` actions is exact. Overwriting is safer for large changes.
*   **Trust Game State:** Always prioritize current Game State Information (NPC positions, map data) over memory or potentially outdated critiques.
*   **`map_analyzer_agent` Error (Turn 5563):** The agent suggested a path through impassable tiles (16,22) and (14,25)-(16,25) to reach Pokecenter. This highlights the need for careful review of agent output, especially regarding pathing and tile interpretation. The Pokecenter entrance seems to be at (14,26), entered by moving Up from (14,27).

# Pewter Pokecenter Access (Revised Plan - Turn 5564)
*   Currently stuck in a pocket (X=5-18, Y=19-21) near the Gym. The Y=22 wall blocks southward movement in this X-range.
*   Plan to reach Pokecenter (14,26) by entering from (14,27):
    1.  Enter Gym warp at (17,18) to escape current pocket.
    2.  Exit Gym (will arrive at (17,19) in Pewter City).
    3.  Navigate from (17,19) to (20,19) (east, past X=19 wall).
    4.  Navigate from (20,19) to (20,27) (south, past Y=22 wall).
    5.  Navigate from (20,27) to (14,27) (west).
    6.  Move Up from (14,27) into Pokecenter warp at (14,26).

# Hindsight & Lessons Learned (Critique Incorporated)
*   `map_analyzer_agent` path provided on turn 5571 was partially misinterpreted. My attempt to move Right from (12,16) to (13,16) on turn 5574 failed, as (13,16) is impassable. The agent's path actually suggested moving Up from (12,16) to (12,15), then to (12,14). I will proceed with this upward movement. This highlights the need to very carefully translate agent coordinate paths into button presses and to verify segments. The agent's path segment was: ... -> (12,16) -> (12,15) -> (12,14) -> (13,14) -> ... . My current plan is to follow this segment.
