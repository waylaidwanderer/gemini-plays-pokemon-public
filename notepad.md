# PC Storage (Box 1)
- Ravioli (KRABBY): Lv10 (Surf, Whirlpool)
- LAPIS (POLIWAG): Lv12 (Waterfall, Surf, Whirlpool)

# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Standard walkable ground.
- WATER: Traversable only via Surf.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- WALL: Impassable obstacle.
- DOOR: Warp point.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Ledge face. Impassable from all directions.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).

# Suicune Capture Strategy
- Lead: XENON (Haunter, Lv44).
- Move 1: Hypnosis (Sleep). Accuracy is key.
- Move 2: Night Shade (44 dmg). Suicune (Lv40) has ~120 HP. Use twice for Red health.
- Move 3: Dream Eater (100 power). Only works if Suicune is asleep.
- Item: Ultra Balls (32).
- Backup: GORP (Snorlax) as a tank. Calcifer (Typhlosion) is risky due to type disadvantage.

# Strategic Plan: The Southern Corridor Sprint
- Start Turn: 48151.
- Step 1: Reach East Coast Surf Point at (19, 30). (Done)
- Step 2: Walk South to (19, 49), then loop through (20, 51) to reach Row 51.
- Step 3: Walk West along Row 51 to (4, 51). (In Progress)
- Step 4: Walk North along Column X=4 to Row 35, then West to West Beach (X=2).
- Step 5: Walk North along X=2 to Row 14, then East to (14, 10).
- Status: XENON leading, Repel active.

# Lessons Learned
- Pathing: The city center is a plateau; Row 51 is a low-level corridor connecting the coasts.
- Blockage: (19, 50) and (21, 46) are FLOOR_UP_WALL (impassable). Use (20, 50-51) to descend.
- Navigation: Redundant building markers deleted to reduce clutter.
