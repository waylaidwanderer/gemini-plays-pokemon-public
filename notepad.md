# Suicune Quest
- Objective: Trigger sighting in Cianwood City at the northern shore.
- Strategy: The Southern promenade (Verified Path)
    1. Surf South to (20, 51) and land at (19, 51).
    2. Walk West along Row 51 to the West Coast corridor at X=2.
    3. Walk North along X=2 to Y=4.
    4. Walk East to (7, 4) to trigger the sighting.
- Note: Internal city walls at X=5, 7, 9, 11, 12 and buoy walls at X=16, 18, 19, 22 block most routes. Row 51 is a confirmed horizontal thoroughfare.
- Suicune sighting count = 1.

# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard walkable ground.
- WATER: Traversable only while Surfing (requires HM03).
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- WALL: Impassable obstacle.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL / LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: In Cianwood, these function as standard WALL tiles from the north (cannot jump down).
- Interaction: To Surf, face WATER from an adjacent FLOOR tile and press A. Stepping onto FLOOR from WATER automatically ends Surfing.

# Lessons Learned
- Cianwood's ledges are impassable from the north.
- Internal walls divide the city into vertical strips. Row 51 is the only clear path between them.
- Zig-zag buoy lines block the eastern sea. Surf south to bypass them.
- Always reveal 'unseen' tiles manually before planning long routes.
