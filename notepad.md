# I. Game World Rules

## A. Traversal & Tile Mechanics
- `ground` / `grass`: Standard walkable tiles.
- `impassable` / `unknown`: Cannot be entered.
- `ledge`: A one-way drop. Can be jumped down from an adjacent higher tile, but not climbed up.
- `steps`: Allows vertical movement between `ground` and `elevated_ground`.
- `elevated_ground`: Walkable ground at a different elevation. Movement to/from `ground` is ONLY possible via `steps` tiles. (Hypothesis confirmed by engine block at (6,10) on Victory Road 1F).
- `ladder_up` / `ladder_down` / `warp`: Warps between maps or floors.

## B. Puzzle Mechanics
- **Boulder Pushing:** The player's position does NOT change when pushing a boulder. (Hypothesis confirmed on Victory Road 1F).
- **Boulder/Item Interaction:** Pushing a boulder onto an item collects the item and moves the boulder into that space.
- **Reset Condition:** Boulder puzzles reset upon leaving and re-entering a map or using ladders between floors.
- **`boulder_switch`:** A floor switch that must have a boulder pushed onto it.
- **`boulder_barrier`:** An impassable wall that is removed when a corresponding `boulder_switch` is activated. State does not update until visible on-screen.
- **`cleared_boulder_barrier`:** Acts as ground. Can sometimes function as a one-way ramp up from `ground` to `elevated_ground`.
- **Remote Push:** It is possible to push a boulder when standing one tile away from it. The player's position does not change.

## C. General Mechanics
- **Poison Damage:** Poisoned Pokémon in the party lose 1 HP every four steps taken outside of battle.
- **Fainted Pokémon can use HMs:** A fainted Pokémon can be selected to use a field move like Strength.
- **Pikachu Interaction:** When moving onto a tile occupied by Pikachu, the player and Pikachu appear to swap positions. The first button press turns to face, the second moves.
- **Dig Field Move:** Can be used to escape caves, acting as an Escape Rope.
- **Surf Mechanic:** To use Surf, the player must be standing on a tile adjacent to the water AND be facing the water tile.

# II. Battle Intelligence

## A. Type Effectiveness Chart (Verified)
- **Super Effective (2x damage):**
  - Water > Rock, Ground, Fire
  - Ground > Fire, Electric, Rock, Ground
  - Ice > Ground, Grass, Flying, Dragon
  - Flying > Fighting, Grass, Bug
  - Fighting > Normal, Rock, Ice
  - Electric > Water, Flying
- **Not Very Effective (0.5x damage):**
  - Normal !> Rock
- **Immune (0x damage):**
  - Ground immune to Electric
  - Flying immune to Ground

## B. Strategic Notes
- **"No Will to Fight" Message:** A party menu cursor error on a fainted Pokémon, not a refusal to battle.
- **Body Slam:** Can cause paralysis.

# III. My Methodology

## A. Core Principles
- **IMMEDIATE ACTION IS PARAMOUNT:** A broken tool is a critical failure. I MUST fix it immediately with `define_tool` instead of deferring the task or attempting workarounds. Fixing tools is my highest priority, above any gameplay objective.
- **Hypothesis-Driven Approach:** I must form a single, testable hypothesis, document it, test it, and record the conclusion. I must actively try to disprove my own conclusions to avoid confirmation bias.
- **Trust Direct Observation:** System hints can be misleading. Direct, in-game observation (e.g., walking into a wall) is the ultimate source of truth.

## B. System Interaction Notes
- **Validation Check Discrepancy:** The system's validation for reachable warps appears to ignore movable obstacles like boulders. This can create a false positive, indicating a path is clear when it is actually blocked. My own tools (`landmass_analyzer`, `generate_path_plan`) provide a more accurate ground truth in these situations.

# IV. Active Strategy: Road to Victory

- **Current State:** On Route 22, heading back to Victory Road after using Dig to escape a self-inflicted softlock on Victory Road 1F.
- **Immediate Plan:** 
    1. Traverse Route 22 and Route 23 to reach the Victory Road entrance.
    2. Re-attempt the Victory Road 1F puzzle, being careful not to block the path with the first boulder.

# V. Tool Development & Testing Ideas
- **Hypothesis to Test:** The `cleared_boulder_barrier` tile acts as a one-way ramp. Test by attempting to move DOWN from an `elevated_ground` tile onto a `cleared_boulder_barrier` tile.
- **Data Management Note:** I will begin using the '✅' emoji to mark items I have picked up to avoid confusion.
