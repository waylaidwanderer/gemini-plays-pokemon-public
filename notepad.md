# Strategy: Trigger Suicune Sighting
- Plan: The Eastern Surf Route.
- Steps:
  1. Surf East to Column 24.
  2. Surf North along Column 24 to Row 8.
  3. Surf West along Row 8 to (17, 8).
  4. Surf South to (17, 10) and land on the coast.
  5. Walk West to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.
- Battle Prep: Lead Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion).
- Note: This route bypasses the complex city walls and one-way slopes. Row 31 is a clear path to the water. Row 10/11/12 are clear paths to the sighting spot.

# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard traversable tile.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable collision.
- WATER: Requires SURF.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (South). Blocks North.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way climb slope. Approach from South (Up move) to climb. Impassable from North (Acts as WALL).
- BREAKABLE ROCK: Requires ROCK SMASH.
