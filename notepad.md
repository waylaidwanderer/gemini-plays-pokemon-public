- Roamers move between adjacent maps whenever the player crosses a map boundary.
- Interception: Identify roamer's map via Pokédex. Stay on that map and pace in grass/water.
- Battle Strategy: XENON (Gastly) uses Mean Look immediately to trap. Hypnosis to sleep.
- Repel Trick: Lead PKMN level must be > local wild PKMN but < Roamer level (Lv40). XENON is Lv17. Raticate was Lv16. This should work if other wild PKMN are <= 17.
