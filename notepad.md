### Reflection (Turn 8681)
- **Execution:** Addressed "Cursor Memory" issues by resetting via Start Menu. Debugged Fly Map navigation step-by-step.
- **Notepad:** Cleaned up obsolete typing logs. Recorded Fly Map list logic.
- **Lesson:** When blind inputs fail, STOP and verify with screen text. Do not assume standard grid navigation.
