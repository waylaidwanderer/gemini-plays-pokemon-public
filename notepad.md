# Strategic Notes
## Objectives
- **Primary:** Reach Indigo Plateau (Money Farming Loop).
- **Secondary:** Defeat Elite Four.
- **Tertiary:** Hunt Roamers (Raikou/Entei) - *Paused*.

## Current Task: Traverse Route 26
- **Location:** Route 26 (North of Healer House).
- **Goal:** Reach Victory Road Gate at (7, 5).
- **Route:** North past Gaven -> Cross to East side at Row 27 -> Cross back near Gate.

## Status
- **Money:** ¥3294 (Gaven Defeated).
- **Repels:** 0.
- **Party:** Gyarados (Lead), Lugia, Machoke, Pidgey, Oddish, Quilava.

## Tile Mechanics
- **LADDER (Route 27/26):** Functions as walkable bridge.
- **Lesson (Turn 32915):** The system strictly enforces the "no mixing directional and action buttons" rule by truncating inputs. When navigating menus, split directional moves (e.g., "Down") and confirmations (e.g., "A") into separate turns to ensure reliability.
