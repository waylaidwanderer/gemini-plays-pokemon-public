# Strategy: Trigger Suicune Sighting
- Plan: The Eastern Surf Route.
- Steps:
  1. Walk Up to (12, 31).
  2. Walk Right to (20, 31).
  3. Use Surf on the water at (20, 31).
  4. Surf East to Column 24.
  5. Surf North along Column 24 to Row 10.
  6. Surf West and land at (15, 10).
  7. Walk to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.
- Battle Prep: Lead Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion).
- Note: This route bypasses the complex city walls and one-way slopes. Row 31 is a clear path to the water. Row 10/11/12 are clear paths to the sighting spot.

# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard traversable tile.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable collision.
- WATER: Requires SURF.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (South). Blocks North.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way climb slope. Approach from South (Up move) to climb. Impassable from North (Acts as WALL).
- BREAKABLE ROCK: Requires ROCK SMASH.
