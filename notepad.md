# Tile Mechanics
- **WATERFALL:** Requires HM Waterfall. Face UP and press A.
- **Observation:** Verified x=6, 7, 8, 9, 10 at Row 29 are "Currents" (they push the player back to Row 30).
- **Conclusion:** x=11 is the ONLY climbable waterfall tile.
- **Plan:**
  1. Ascend Waterfall at x=11 (Right side).
  2. **Crucial:** Once at the top (Row 27), Surf LEFT to reach the western channel. The water at the top connects!
  3. Follow the western channel North to Warp (11, 5).
