# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) in Cianwood City to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The Great Northern Buoy Loop (Confirmed Path)
- Plan:
  1. Use Super Repel. [DONE]
  2. Surf at (27, 44). [IN PROGRESS]
  3. Navigate to (14, 16) via (27, 6) and (19, 6).
  4. Land at (13, 16).
  5. Walk to (14, 10) via (2, 16), (2, 12), and (14, 12).
- Status: At (27, 44) on land. Repel active.
- Reasoning: Land access to the northern plateau is blocked by the Row 15 wall/ledge barrier (X=3 to X=17). The only land gap is the West Beach (X=2). To reach the West Beach, one must land at (13, 16) from the water. The water route requires bypassing buoy walls at X=26 and X=22 via gaps at Row 6, then passing the X=18 buoy wall via the gap at Row 16.

# Blocked Routes (Verified)
- Land Access: Row 15 wall (3-9, 15) and ledge (10, 15) and wall (12-17, 15).
- Water Access (South): Row 15 buoy wall (18-22, 15).
- Water Access (East): X=26 buoy wall (0-9, 26).

# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard ground. Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Surf required. Traversable.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable cliff face.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
