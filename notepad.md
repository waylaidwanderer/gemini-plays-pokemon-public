## Strategy: Inner Channel Route to Suicune
**Start Turn:** 48900 (Quest: Trigger Suicune Overworld Sighting)

Cianwood is a maze of 'FLOOR_UP_WALL' barriers. I will navigate the buoy gaps to enter the 'Inner Channel' (X=13-15) and land on the northern plateau.

### Step-by-Step Execution Plan
1. Surf South to (25, 16). <- CURRENT TASK
2. Surf West to (21, 16) via the gap in the X=22 buoy wall at Row 16.
3. Surf South to (21, 26), then West to (17, 26) via the gap in the X=19/18 buoy wall at Row 26.
4. Surf North to (17, 21), then West to (13, 21) via the gap in the X=16 buoy wall.
5. Surf North to the landing at (13, 16).
6. Walk to (11, 14) to reach the plateau level.
7. Walk to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune sighting.

## Navigation: Buoy Gaps (X-Wall at Row)
- X=26 Wall: Gap at Row 10-14.
- X=22 Wall: Gap at Row 16-21.
- X=19/18 Wall: Gap at Row 26-29.
- X=16 Wall: Gap at Row 16-21.

## Failed Hypotheses & Lessons
- Great Sea Bypass (Route 40): Dead end on the West.
- Southern Crossing (Row 48/51): Blocked by multiple 'FLOOR_UP_WALL' lines at Rows 46 and 50.
- Inner Channel North (X=13-17): Blocked at Row 15 by a solid wall of WALL tiles.

## Inventory Check
- Super Repel: 5 remaining. Last applied turn 49278. (~195 steps remaining).

## Battle Strategy: Eusine
- Lead: Calcifer (Lv 64 Typhlosion).
- Strategy: Sweep with Flamethrower. OHKO potential on most targets.
