## Suicune Trigger Hypothesis Testing (Route 42)
- Hypothesis 28: Trigger is proximity to the three Apricorn trees on the island. FAILED.
- Step 3: Sweep remaining island floor tiles. [DONE]
- Result: Full sweep of island clearing (Rows 14-17) failed to trigger Suicune.
- Step 4: Explore western mainland path at (1, 8)-(3, 10). [In Progress]
- Result: (4, 14)-(7, 14) is WALL, not a path.
- Step 5: Follow tracker advice - Surf to southern tip of island (X=26, Y=16) and walk perimeter.
- Hypothesis 30: Trigger is on a high ledge reachable only via Mt. Mortar (10, 5).

# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL / HEADBUTT_TREE / ROCK / VOID / FLOOR_UP_WALL / WATER_ROCKS: Impassable.
- CUT_TREE: Impassable until CUT.
- WATER: Traversable with SURF.
- TALL_GRASS / LONG_GRASS: Traversable; triggers encounters.
- LEDGE: One-way traversable (usually South).
- WARP / DOOR / WARP_CARPET / CAVE: Map transition.
- FRUIT_TREE: Impassable; interact for fruit/apricorn.
