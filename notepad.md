# Strategy: Trigger Suicune Sighting (Started: Turn 51131, Turn 51341 - Refined Plan)
- City Logic: Vertical walls partition the city. Row 51 is the only continuous horizontal highway. Gaps in the Row 50 terraces exist at X=11 and X=20.
- The Long Trek (Execution Plan):
  1. Walk West to (12, 32), then South to (12, 49).
  2. Walk West to (10, 49), then South to (10, 50).
  3. Walk East to (11, 50), then South to (11, 51) (Southern Highway).
  4. Walk West along Row 51 to (2, 51) (Western Corridor).
  5. Walk North along X=2 to (2, 14).
  6. Walk East to (8, 14), then North to (8, 10).
  7. Walk East to (14, 10) for the Suicune sighting.
