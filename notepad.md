1. Cancel the shop menu and exit the Ecruteak Mart.
2. Check Suicune's location in the Pokedex AREA map.
3. Use suicune_tracker_v2 with the discovered location.
4. If Suicune is roaming, decide on a boundary-cycling location (like Route 36/37).
5. If Suicune is at a specific milestone (like the Route 42 island), head there.
