# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Active Strategy: The Rock Smash Solution
The northern plateau (14, 10) is blocked by rocks. I need TM08 Rock Smash to proceed.

### Action Plan
1. Search Cianwood houses for the Rock Smash NPC.
2. Teach Rock Smash to a party member (GNEISS or GORP).
3. Clear the rocks at (8,16) or (10,27) to reach Suicune.

## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Acts as an impassable wall from the North. (Verified at 8,48 and 12,50).
- Smashable Rocks: Blocking paths at (8,16), (9,17), (4,19), (4,25), (10,27), (5,29).
- NPC Mania: In house at (17,41). Requesting Shuckle back.

## Battle Plan: Eusine
- Lead: Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion).
- Strategy: Flamethrower/Thunderpunch sweep.
- Status: Fully healed.

- **Rock Smash Search Start:** Turn 49951.
- Searched Houses:
  - Manias House (17,41): Mania (Rocker) - Does NOT give Rock Smash.
- Next: Scout northern rocks (Row 16-27) for the TM NPC.
- Note: Advisor says NPC is typically outside near the rocks.
