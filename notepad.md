# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement (acting as a ledge). Passable from SOUTH to NORTH.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at Row 15 (X=3-17).
- ROCK: Smashable rocks act as WALLs.
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- Started: Turn 49630
## Strategy: The Secret Gap Bypass
Reach (14, 10) by using the gap at (11, 15) to bypass the Row 15 ledge.
1. Move North along X=12 to (12, 28).
2. Surf from (12, 28) to (12, 16) and land.
3. Move West to (11, 16) and North through gap at (11, 15) to (11, 14).
4. Move East to (14, 14) and North to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

# Progress Notes
- Verified: (11, 15) is FLOOR, providing a gap in the Row 15 ledge/wall.
- Verified: Row 12 is a clear horizontal path from X=2 to X=14.
- Blocked: All other land routes (X=4, 6, 9) are blocked by walls or NORTH-blocking ledges at Row 15.
- Blocked: Sea Route is restricted by complex buoy walls and landing point barriers.
