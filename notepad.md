# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Timestamp:** Turn 25602 (Jan 6, 2026)
- **Primary Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Immediate Task:** Reach the Northwest area of Silver Cave Outside.
- **Current Location:** Victory Road Gate (0, 7).
- **Observation:** Walking "Left" moved me off the warp tile.
- **Hypothesis:** Stepping back ONTO the warp tile at (1, 7) should trigger the exit to Route 28.
- **Plan:**
    1. Walk Right to (1, 7).
    2. Exit to Route 28.
    3. Head West along the top edge to find the NW House.
- **Note:** If this exits me back to the East side (Sign), I will need to look for a different exit in this room or re-evaluate the Route 28 map.

# Tile Mechanics & Observations
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT:** Standard one-way jumpable tiles.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Inconsistent behavior observed.
    - **Confirmed Ledge:** (39, 32) allowed jumping South.
    - **Confirmed Wall:** (6, 30) and (28, 34) blocked movement South.
    - **Strategy:** Treat as WALL unless verified otherwise.
- **Navigation Notes:**
    - The "Central" area (x=5) connects to the West path via Row 22 (re-verified via Mental Map).
    - Row 30 acts as a hard barrier across most of the map, separating the North and South sections.

# Key Locations
- **Mt. Silver Cave Entrance:** (18, 11)
- **Pokemon Center:** (23, 19)
- **Route 28 Exit:** (39, 31)
