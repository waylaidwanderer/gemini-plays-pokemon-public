# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Reach the Dragon Shrine via the East Whirlpool.

# Reflection (Turn 18229)
- **Execution:** No tasks deferred. Active correction of pathing errors.
- **Notepad:** Consolidated navigation notes. Removed stale "West Whirlpool" plans.
- **Map:** Markers are accurate.
- **Errors:** Major delay caused by false belief that I lacked the Whirlpool badge. Lesson: Verify Game State > Memory.
- **Strategy:** Validated that West Whirlpool path is a dead end. East Whirlpool is the primary path.
