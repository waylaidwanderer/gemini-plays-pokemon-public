# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard ground. Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Surf required. Traversable.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- DOOR: Warp point.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable cliff face.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
- BREAKABLE ROCK: Requires Rock Smash. Impassable.
- NPC: Impassable. Interact from adjacent tile.

# Blocked Routes (Verified)
- Central City: Vertical walls at X=5 and X=9 block East-West movement from Row 30 to Row 45.
- Row 46 Cliff: Impassable wall from X=6 to X=29, separating the southern city from the north.
- Inner Channel: Buoy wall at Row 15 (X=18-22) creates a dead-end pocket.

# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) in Cianwood City to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The Route 41 Deep Sea Loop
- Plan:
  1. Use Super Repel. [DONE]
  2. Walk to (25, 37) and Surf at (26, 37). [IN PROGRESS]
  3. Exit East to Route 41.
  4. Navigate North on Route 41 to Row 12 (or Row 5).
  5. Re-enter Cianwood City at (29, 12) (or 29, 5).
  6. Navigate to Row 6 and pass West through gaps at (22, 6) and (19, 6).
  7. Move South to (18, 12) and land at (16, 12).
  8. Walk to (14, 10).
- Status: At (23, 37) on land. Repel active.
- Reasoning: The northern plateau is only accessible via water through gaps in the buoy maze at Row 6. These gaps are unreachable from the southern city due to the Row 15 buoy wall. Re-entering from Route 41 bypasses the barriers.
