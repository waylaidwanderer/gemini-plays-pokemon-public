# Gem's Pokémon Yellow Legacy - Hard Mode Playthrough

## Current Objective: Train for Pewter Gym
- **Primary Goal:** Train key Pokémon to the level cap (12).
- **Immediate Task:** Use the PC to assemble the training team.

## Actionable Lessons & Strategy
- **Verify First:** Before assuming a block, verify my position and facing direction.
- **Systematic Navigation:** When a path isn't obvious, systematically explore boundaries instead of brute-forcing. Trust the 'reachable' flag.
- **USE YOUR AGENTS:** Use agents proactively for planning, not just reactively when stuck.
- **PC Menu Loop Failure (Pewter City):** Stuck for ~120+ turns. All hypotheses involving selecting 'Gem's PC' have failed. The 'A' button press to clear confirmation dialogs seems to be unavoidably registered as a selection on the subsequent menu, always leading to the Item Box. **New Hypothesis (Attempt #4):** The correct menu option is 'SOMEONE's PC', not 'Gem's PC'. I will now systematically log out and attempt to select 'SOMEONE's PC' to see if it leads to the Pokémon Storage System.

## Defeated Trainers Log
- **OAK'S LAB:** Rival Pixel
- **ROUTE 22:** Rival Pixel
- **VIRIDIAN FOREST:** Lass (3,42), Youngster (28,20), Youngster (28,34), Bug Catcher (14,18), Bug Catcher (3,19)

## Training Plan (Pre-Brock)
- **Location:** Route 22 (Wild Encounters)
- **Team:** NIGHTSHADE, FURYFIST, SPIKE, SPARKY
- **Objective:** Train NIGHTSHADE, FURYFIST, and SPIKE to Lv. 12.
  - FURYFIST needs to learn Low Kick at Lv. 9.
  - SPIKE needs to learn Double Kick at Lv. 12.

## World Knowledge Graph Tasks
- Add edge between Pewter City (Node ID needed) and Pewter Pokecenter (Node ID needed).

## Assumptions & Hypotheses to Test
- **Current Hypothesis:** Selecting 'SOMEONE's PC' is the correct way to access the Pokémon Storage System. ('Gem's PC' repeatedly leads to Item Storage).
- **Assumption:** The PC menu is not bugged and has a logical solution.
- **Assumption:** There is no other method to manage Pokémon besides the PC.
