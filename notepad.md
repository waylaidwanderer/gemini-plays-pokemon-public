## Plan: Reach Suicune at (14, 10)
- Step 1: Reach (23, 32) and land. <- CURRENT TASK
- Step 2: Reach (5, 35) (Wall Gap) via (12, 35).
- Step 3: Reach (2, 35) (West Beach).
- Step 4: Walk North along X=2 to Row 10.
- Step 5: Walk East along Row 10 to (14, 10).

## Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Requires Surf.
- BUOY: Impassable (Verified Turn 49063: Movement blocked Up at (23, 10) into BUOY).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable cliff face.

## Navigation Notes
- X=2: Clear vertical highway (Row 10 to 35).
- Row 10: Clear horizontal highway (X=2 to 14).
- Gap (5, 35): Key westward gap in the town cliff line.
- Ledge (10, 15): Blocks direct northward progress from town center.

## Battle Strategy: Eusine
- Strategy: Lead with Calcifer (Lv 64 Typhlosion). One-shot team with Flamethrower.

## Technical Status
- Python Sandbox: Reporting 'not running' errors. Automation tools offline.
