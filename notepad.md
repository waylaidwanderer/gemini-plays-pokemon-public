# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Active Strategy: The Great Southern Sea Loop
The city's internal walls and one-way ledges (FLOOR_UP_WALL) block direct land access to the northern plateau. Row 51 is the only clear East-West passage, and it's only reachable by sea.

1. Surf South from (23, 32) to (24, 51). (In Progress)
2. Land at (23, 51).
3. Walk West along Row 51 to (2, 51) to enter the Western Corridor.
4. Walk North through the corridor (X=0-2) to Row 10.
5. Walk East along Row 10 to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune sighting.

## Verified Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement (Confirmed at (10, 47) -> (10, 48)).
- Western Corridor: X=0-2 is clear of ledges from Row 51 to Row 10.
- Central Pool: Enclosed by buoys; no exit to the north or west.
