# Suicune Capture Strategy
- Lead: XENON (Haunter, Lv44).
- Move 1: Hypnosis (Sleep). Accuracy is key.
- Move 2: Night Shade (44 dmg). Suicune (Lv40) has ~120 HP. Use twice for Red health.
- Move 3: Dream Eater (100 power). Only works if Suicune is asleep.
- Item: Ultra Balls (32).
- Backup: GORP (Snorlax) as a tank. Calcifer (Typhlosion) is risky due to type disadvantage.

# Strategic Plan: The West Beach Sprint
- Start Turn: 48151.
- Step 1: Reach East Coast Surf Point and land at (27, 45). (Done)
- Step 2: Walk to Gym Area at (6, 45). (Done)
- Step 3: Navigate to Row 35 gap: (6, 45) -> (6, 44) -> (12, 44) -> (12, 35) -> (5, 35). (Next)
- Step 4: Walk West to the beach corridor at X=2.
- Step 5: Walk North along X=2 to Row 12.
- Step 6: Walk East along Row 12 to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.
- Status: XENON leading, Repel active.

# Lessons Learned
- Pathing: The city center is a plateau; the X=5 wall has a clear gap at (5, 35).
- Navigation: Row 51 is also a clear corridor, but Row 35 is faster from the city center.
- Blockage: (7, 45) is a Gym Sign (WALL). Must go around.
