# Lessons Learned
- Menu Navigation: Cursor memory is persistent. Split deep navigation into chunks < 50 buttons.
- Fly: Outdoors only.
- Roamers: Move only on map transitions. Shorter pacing sessions (10 steps) are more efficient.
- Repel Step Counting: Log summary only to avoid bloat and errors. Reset count when Repel wears off.
