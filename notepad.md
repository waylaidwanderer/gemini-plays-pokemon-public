## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Cure Jasmine's Ampharos (Lighthouse).
- **Secondary Goal:** Travel to Cianwood City to get the SecretPotion.
- **Immediate Plan:** Exit Poke Seer's House, continue North to find the Gym, then challenge Chuck.

## Party Status
- **Muscle (Machoke):** Lv 37.
- **Garnet (Quilava):** Lv 28.
- **Hematite (Pinsir):** Lv 15.
- **Azurite (Heracross):** Lv 13.
- **Lapis (Poliwag):** Lv 10. (Surf carrier)
- **Shuckie (Shuckle):** Lv 15. (Moves: Constrict, Withdraw, Wrap, Encore)
- **Rocky (Onix):** Deposited in Box 3.

## Quests
- **Webster:** Deliver mail to Route 31 (KENYA is in Box 1).
- **Jasmine:** Needs medicine for Ampharos (Amphy).

## Navigation Log
- **Olivine Lighthouse:** Cleared 1F-5F. Reached 6F via Center Column.
- **Route 40:** Reached western edge (Buoys). Heading South to enter Route 41.
- **Route 41:** Navigating the Whirl Islands maze.
    - Found gap in buoys at Column 24.
    - Defeated Swimmers Charlie, Susie, Berke, and Denise.
    - Moving South towards Cianwood.
    - Defeated Swimmer Mathew. South blocked by buoys at Row 53. Found passage West to Cianwood at Row 45.

## Hints & Lore
- **Whirl Islands:**
    - Swimmer Berke mentioned a secret about the islands blocked by whirlpools.
    - Teacher in Cianwood house mentioned a "mythical sea creature" hiding in the four islands (Lugia).
    - Lass in Cianwood house says you need a **SILVER WING** to see the creature.

## Tile Mechanics
- **Lighthouse Pits:** Gaps on 4F/5F drop to the floor below. Jumping into the pit on 4F North (Cols 8-9) is the solution to reach the central column.
- **WATER:** Traversable with SURF. Encounters wild Pokémon.
- **BUOY:** Impassable wall.
- **WARP_CARPET_DOWN:** Triggers a map transition when stepped on.

## Reminders
- **Move Tutor:** Teach Strength to Muscle (replace Leer/Focus Energy) when possible.
- **HM Requirements:** Might need Rock Smash (TM08) to access certain areas. Check if Gym is blocked.
- **Route 41:** Blockage at (24, 39). Detouring West to Column 23 to continue South.
- **Observation:** Potential land (FLOOR tiles) spotted at (28, 42). Possibly one of the Whirl Islands.
- **Navigation:** Taking the Western channel (Cols 22-23) to bypass the buoy blockage and continue South/West towards Cianwood.
- **Route 41:** Defeated Swimmer Wendy at (9, 50). Continuing West towards Cianwood.
- **Cianwood City:** Arrived.
    - **Pokemon Center:** Located at (23, 43).
    - **Pharmacy:** Located at (15, 47).
    - **Lugia Speech House:** Located at (15, 37).
    - **Mania's House:** Located at (17, 41). Mania gave Shuckie (Lv 15).
    - **Poke Seer's House:** Located at (5, 17).
    - **Suicune Event:** Encountered Suicune at (10, 14). It ran away. Eusine appeared and challenged me to a battle to earn Suicune's respect.
    - **Gym:** Leader Chuck is here. Location still unconfirmed, likely North.
- **Eusine Battle:**
    - Drowzee (Lv 23). Used Hypnosis.
    - Haunter (Lv 23).
    - Electrode (Lv 25).
- **Inventory Note:** The Game State inventory list is sorted alphabetically and does NOT reflect in-game bag order. Must inspect bag visually to find item indices.
- **Battle Log:** Drowzee's Dream Eater deals ~14 damage to Muscle (Lv 37 vs Lv 23). Very manageable.
- **Mechanics:** In Gen 2, Pokemon wake up at the start of the turn and can attack immediately. Mash Fight/Dig.
- **Battle Update:** Muscle still asleep. Drowzee spamming Dream Eater. Muscle HP: 59/121. Continuing to select DIG to wake up and attack.
- **Battle Critical:** Muscle HP 24/121 (Sleep). Must wake up or risk fainting. Next in line: Garnet.
- **Battle Update:** Muscle defeated Drowzee but is at critical HP (24/121). Eusine sending out Haunter (Ghost/Poison).
- **Strategy:** Switching to Garnet (Quilava) to handle Haunter with Fire moves (Ember). Muscle's Normal/Fighting moves are useless, and Dig is risky at low HP.
- **Battle Update:** Switched to Garnet (Lv 28) vs Haunter (Lv 23). Using Ember (Slot 4) to deal neutral special damage.
- **Battle Update:** Garnet hit Haunter with Ember. Haunter used Curse, cutting its HP in half and Cursing Garnet. Garnet will take residual damage.
- **Strategy:** Haunter is low HP (Ember + Curse cost). Finishing it with another Ember.
- **Battle Update:** Garnet is Cursed and Asleep (40/78 HP). Haunter is low HP. Trying to wake up and use Ember.
- **Inventory:** Have 2 Awakenings if needed.
- **Strategy:** Mash Fight/Ember. If HP gets critical, will use Item or Switch.
- **Battle Strategy:** Switching to Shuckie (Shuckle) to tank hits. Normal moves (Pinsir/Heracross) are useless against Ghost. Shuckle has high Sp. Def.
- **Next Steps:** Use Shuckle to stall while healing Muscle with Super Potion. Then sweep with Muscle's Dig.
- **Battle Log:** Used Super Potion on Muscle (Slot 1). Healed +50 HP.
- **Current State:** Shuckie is active. Haunter (Low HP) vs Shuckie.
- **Next Plan:** Switch Muscle in to finish Haunter with Dig.
- **Battle Log:** Muscle healed (+50 HP). Waiting for turn to end (Haunter attacks Shuckie).
- **Next Turn:** Switch Muscle (Slot 1) in.
- **Risk:** Hypnosis on switch.
- **Battle Strategy:** Shuckie successfully tanked Lick. Muscle healed.
- **Action:** Switching Muscle back in (Slot 1) to replace Shuckie.
- **Goal:** Defeat Haunter with Dig.
