- Evidence: Summary Turn 18350-19055 confirms Tin Tower battle and tracking across routes.

# Capture Prep (Roaming)
- Strategy: Mean Look (XENON) -> Hypnosis (XENON).
- Level Gap: Suicune (Lv40) vs XENON (Lv21). XENON needs levels or a sturdier lead.
- Resources: 1 Ultra Ball, 23 Great Balls. Need ¥12,000 for 10+ Ultra Balls.
- Funding: Sell Fire/Water stones at Ecruteak Mart (¥2100). Battle remaining trainers on Route 42/44.

# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN/RIGHT: One-way movement.
- HEADBUTT_TREE/CUT_TREE: Impassable; Cut removes Cut Trees.
- COUNTER: Interact from adjacent tile.

# Lessons Learned
- Suicune sequence: Burned Tower -> Cianwood -> Route 42 island -> Tin Tower battle -> Roaming.
- Map transitions (like entering Mt. Mortar) relocate roaming Pokemon.

# Lessons Learned (Turn 19160)
- Suicune Sequence: Scripted events (Burned Tower -> Cianwood -> Route 42 Island -> Tin Tower) must be finished before roaming starts. Check Summary for "Tin Tower battle" to confirm phase.
- Pokedex Sensitivity: Scrolling is fast; use small chunks of "Down" presses and verify ID #245 before clicking.
- False Constraints: Don't spend 50 turns on a tile trigger if the summary says you've already passed that event. Verify milestones with specialized agents.
- Menu Recovery: If a button sequence fails, reset to the overworld before trying again.
