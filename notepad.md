# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Active Strategy: The North-West Passage
The northern plateau (14, 10) is accessible via the Western Corridor (X=0-2). I have found a clear path through the city's internal walls by heading North to Row 29, which is clear of ledges and walls between X=2 and X=15.

1. Walk North to Row 30 at (19, 30). (In Progress)
2. Walk West to (15, 30).
3. Walk North to Row 29 at (15, 29).
4. Walk West along Row 29 to the Western Corridor at (2, 29).
5. Walk North along X=2 to the plateau entry at (2, 12).
6. Walk East along Row 12 to (14, 12), then North to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.
