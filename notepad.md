# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Navigate to the Dragon Shrine (Go around the whirlpool).

# Critical Discovery (Turn 18192)
- **Whirlpool:** Fails because I DO NOT HAVE THE RISING BADGE. Clair hasn't given it to me yet.
- **Implication:** The path to the shrine MUST NOT require Whirlpool.
- **Map Analysis:** I am at (15, 22). To my East is a wall (16, 22). But North of the wall (Row 21) is clear WATER.
- **Solution:** I can Surf North to (15, 21), then East to (18, 21), then South to land on the island at (18, 22).
- **Correction:** Stop trying to brute force the Whirlpool. Go around.
