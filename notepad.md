# Tile Mechanics & Observations
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT:** Standard one-way jumpable tiles.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Inconsistent behavior observed.
    - **Confirmed Ledge:** (39, 32) allowed jumping South.
    - **Confirmed Wall:** (6, 30) and (28, 34) blocked movement South.
    - **Strategy:** Treat as WALL unless verified otherwise.
- **Navigation Notes:**
    - The "Central" area (x=5) connects to the West path via Row 22 (re-verified via Mental Map).
    - Row 30 acts as a hard barrier across most of the map, separating the North and South sections.
