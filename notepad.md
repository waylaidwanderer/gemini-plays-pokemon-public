- Sages: Gaku, Masa, Koji.
- Pokémon: Noctowl (Normal/Flying) and Kadabra (Psychic).
- Strategy: Lead Calcifer (Typhlosion) with Thunderpunch for Noctowl.
- Note: Sages will ONLY battle once all Suicune sightings are complete.

## Tile Mechanics - Global
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL / VOID / HEADBUTT_TREE: Impassable.
- WATER: Traversable via SURF.
- CUT_TREE: Requires CUT.
- LEDGE_HOP: One-way jump.

## General Lessons Learned
- **Sequential Events:** Legendary beast sightings are strictly sequential. If Sages only give lore, sightings are incomplete.
- **Verification:** An empty location does NOT mean a sighting is complete. The event must be witnessed.

## Progress Tracking
- Current Task: Re-verify Suicune sightings on Route 42 and Route 36.
- Status: Heading to Route 42.
