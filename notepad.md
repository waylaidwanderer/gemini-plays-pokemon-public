  - **Plan**: Return to Gatehouse -> Accept Spearow -> Proceed to Route 36.

### Tile Mechanics
- TYPE_3fe2: Floor (Walkable)
- TYPE_63e2: Wall/Planter (Blocked)
- TYPE_ffbb: Warp/Door (Walkable)
- TYPE_989e: Door Mat (Likely Blocked/Collision)

### Notes
- **Sudowoodo Strategy**: Interact with the tree on Route 36 to 'activate' the need for the SquirtBottle, then return to Goldenrod Flower Shop.
- **Navigation**: West side of Goldenrod is accessed via the South path near Radio Tower. Alley west of Game Corner is a dead end.
- Navigation: West Edge (X=5) confirmed blocked/wall.
- Navigation: Building at (15, 7) confirmed as Name Rater (Dead End).
- Navigation: Building at (29, 5) confirmed as Flower Sister's House (Dead End).
- Navigation: Main Avenue (X=13-16) blocked by building at Row 5.
- Hypothesis: This building IS the Gatehouse to Route 35.
- Plan: Go to Main Avenue (X=15, Y=6). Enter the building at (15, 5) or adjacent tiles (14, 5), (13, 5).
- Correction: Previous "Wall" assessment likely mistook the Gatehouse for a solid obstacle.
- System: Python sandbox tools are down. Using manual navigation.
