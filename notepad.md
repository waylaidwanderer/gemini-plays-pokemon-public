## Strategy: Crossing Cianwood to Suicune
The city walls (X=5 and X=7) have gaps that align at Row 48.

### Step-by-Step Execution Plan
1. Return to Route 41 via the warp at (12, 35). <- CURRENT TASK
2. Return to Cianwood City at (29, 44).
3. Walk to the X=12 corridor and move Down to Row 48.
4. Walk West through the gaps at (7, 48) and (5, 48) to reach the West Beach.
5. Walk North along the beach to the plateau at (14, 10).
6. Trigger Suicune sighting.

## Tile Mechanics: Cianwood City
- FLOOR: Standard traversable ground.
- WALL: Standard impassable barrier.
- WATER: Traversable only with Surf HM.
- BUOY: Impassable water barrier.
- DOOR: Warp point to building interior.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump South. Impassable from the North side (cannot jump back up).
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable from the North. Behaves like a wall when moving Down into it.

## Failed Hypotheses & Lessons
- Great Sea Bypass: Route 40 is a dead end on the West. Surfing around the island via Route 41 is blocked by buoys at Row 49 and Row 5.
- City Corridor North: Blocked by recurring 'FLOOR_UP_WALL' barriers at Rows 46, 48, and 50.
- X=12 Corridor: Blocked at (12, 50) by 'FLOOR_UP_WALL'.
- X=20 Corridor: Blocked by 'WALL' at (20, 46-49).

## Inventory Check
- Super Repel: 6 remaining. Last applied turn 49248. (~75 steps remaining).

## Battle Strategy: Eusine
- Lead: Calcifer (Lv 64 Typhlosion).
- Strategy: Sweep with Flamethrower. OHKO potential on most targets.
