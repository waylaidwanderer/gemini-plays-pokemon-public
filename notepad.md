# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Deliver Kenya to Route 31.
- **Secondary Goal:** Travel to Mahogany Town (Route 42).
- **Tertiary Goal:** Train Party to Level 30+.
- **Current Action:** Fix Kenya's Mail (Removing Old Mail - Retry).
  1. **Observation:** "Mailbox full" error prevented removing mail. Kenya still holds it (icon visible).
  2. **Step 1:** Enter Party Menu (Current).
  3. **Step 2:** Select Kenya -> `TAKE`.
  4. **Step 3:** Select `NO` when asked "Send to PC?" (This should put it in the Bag).
  5. **Step 4:** Verify mail is removed.
  6. **Step 5:** Give fresh `FLOWER MAIL` and write message.

## Strategy & Lessons
- **Quest Item Logic:** Do not alter quest items (e.g., mail messages) unless necessary. Original attributes often matter.
- **Fly Map:** List-based `Up`/`Down`. Order: New Bark -> Cherrygrove -> Violet -> Azalea -> Goldenrod.
- **Menu Cursor:** Always verify position.
- **Negative Results:** Mark NPCs with "Generic Text" or "Wrong Recipient" to avoid re-checking.
