# Suicune Quest Strategy: 'The Western Land Corridor'
- Observation: The western side of Cianwood City (X=0-2) is a clear, continuous corridor of FLOOR tiles from the south beach to the north plateau.
- Route:
    1. Fly to Cianwood City (Arrive at 23, 44).
    2. Walk West to X=2 (e.g., 2, 44).
    3. Walk North along X=2 to Row 14 (e.g., 2, 14).
    4. Walk East to (7, 14).
    5. Walk North to Suicune sighting at (7, 4).
- Preparation: Lead with XENON (Haunter) for Hypnosis. Use SUPER REPEL after landing.
- Start Turn: 47680 (Suicune North Beach Quest)
- Start Time: Wednesday, Jan 14, 2026, 4:00 AM PST

# Strategy Lessons
- Buoy Maze: The buoy spiral is a trap designed to block access from the east. The landing spot (14, 10) is only reachable via the western channel or a very specific path through the inner buoys.
- Land Route Efficiency: When water navigation is complex, look for land-based corridors (like X=2) that bypass the obstacles.
- Menu Discipline: Slow down during menu navigation to avoid entering Options or Pokemon stats accidentally. Verify the cursor position before pressing A.
