# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The West Beach Corridor (Verified)
- Plan:
  1. Clear SURF message at (12, 27). [IN PROGRESS]
  2. Use Super Repel to avoid wild encounters.
  3. Land at (12, 28).
  4. Walk West to (2, 28).
  5. Walk North along the X=2 corridor to (2, 12).
  6. Walk East to (14, 12), then North to (14, 10).
- Status: At (12, 27) on water, clearing message.
- Reasoning: X=2 is a clear corridor that bypasses all city obstacles (rocks, ledges) and the buoy maze. Access is confirmed via Row 28.
