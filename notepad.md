# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Active Strategy: The Central Corridor Descent
The city is a maze of one-way ledges and buoy walls. The only path to the northern plateau (14, 10) is via the Western Corridor (X=0-2), which is only accessible from the southern edge (Row 51).

1. Run from the current battle at (28, 37). (In Progress)
2. Surf West to (12, 37), then North to (12, 27).
3. Land at (12, 28).
4. Walk South along X=12 to (12, 49).
5. Walk West to (11, 49), then South through the Row 50 gap to (11, 51).
6. Walk West along Row 51 to (2, 51) to enter the Western Corridor.
7. Walk North through the corridor to (2, 10).
8. Walk East along Row 10 to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

## Verified Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement (Confirmed at Row 46, X=28 and Row 50, X=12).
- Row 50 Gap: (11, 50) is FLOOR, allowing passage to Row 51.
- Western Corridor: X=0-2 is clear of ledges from Row 51 to Row 10.
