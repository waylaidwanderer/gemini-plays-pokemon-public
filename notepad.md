# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026
- Current Location: Goldenrod Flower Shop (Map 10_14)

### Immediate Goals
1. **Find Floria**: Explore the North-East corner of the National Park.
2. **Find Exit to Route 36**: Likely in the North-East.
3. **Get SquirtBottle**: Return to Flower Shop after finding Floria.

### Quest Log
- **Badges**: Zephyr, Hive, Plain.
- **Party**: All Healthy.
- **Mail Quest**: Active.
- **Contest**: Not entered (lack of Sport Balls/Bug Catching logic).

### Strategic Notes
- **SquirtBottle**: Inspected Sudowoodo. Returning to Flower Shop. If refused, must locate Floria (likely near Sudowoodo or Route 36).
- **Map Intel**: Sudowoodo (Route 36/National Park junction) needs to be cleared.
- **Quest**: Talk to Flower Shop sister (current), then find Floria (likely Route 36 or near Sudowoodo).

### Reflection (Turn 11820)
- **Progress**: Returned to Route 35, navigated to the building at the south end.
- **Correction**: The "Flower Shop Back Door" at (9, 33) needs verification. If it's not a door, I might need to go around to the main gatehouse entrance.
- **Hygiene**: Cleaned up markers. Navigation tool requires precise targets.
- **Plan**: Enter building -> Goldenrod -> Flower Shop -> SquirtBottle.
