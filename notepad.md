- **Elm's Lab PC (3, 5):** Research notes only; no storage access.
- **Menu Verification:** Always cross-reference "Current Screen Text" and "Text History".
- **Rising Badge:** Allows use of HM07 Waterfall outside battle (Johto Badge 8).

## Contest Scoring Criteria
- Formula: Level + (Remaining HP / Max HP) * 100 + Base Stat Total factor.
- Tiers: Scyther and Pinsir are top tier. Higher level and full HP are best.
- Winning: 1st place typically requires 300-350+ points.

## Battle Strategies
- Wild Battles: Running is prioritized for efficiency.
- Bug-Catching Contest: Use Hypnosis. Avoid damaging low-level targets with Night Shade. Catching at full HP is prioritized.
