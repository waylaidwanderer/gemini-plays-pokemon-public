# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Current Task
- **Status**: Eusine departed. Path unlocked.
- **Observation**: Eusine walked to (7, 15). The tile changed type to `TYPE_8564` (Ladder/Hole?).
- **Action**: Clear text -> Follow Eusine's path.
- **Route**: South to (10, 13) -> Left to (7, 13) -> South to (7, 15).
- **Party**: Garnet (77/90).
- **Goal**: Fall to B1F -> Find Legendary Beasts.

### Party Status
- Garnet (32) [Critical], Basil (9), Amethyst (10) [Fainted], Spinarak (14), Topaz (15) [Fainted], Harrz (14) [Fainted].

### Reflection & Plan
- **Reflection**: I've been hallucinating exits. `find_reachable_exits` confirmed I am trapped. I must rely on game mechanics (triggers/holes) rather than hoping for walls to disappear.
- **Eusine**: He ran away to the SE. Following his path might reveal the way.
- **Plan**: Move South to (10, 10). Search adjacent tiles.
- **Route**: (10, 5) -> South to (10, 10).
