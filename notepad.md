## Suicune Quest (Started Turn 49107)
- Goal: Trigger Suicune sighting at (14, 10).
- Strategy: Test the "Inner Channel Landing" at (17, 11). If blocked, use the "West Beach Highway" (X=2).

## Plan: Reach Suicune at (14, 10)
- Step 1: Walk to (12, 28) and Surf North. <- CURRENT TASK
- Step 2: Test landing at (16, 11) via hypothesized water at (17, 11).
- Step 3: If Step 2 fails, return to (12, 28) and use Land Route:
  (12, 28) -> (12, 44) -> (5, 44) -> (5, 35) -> (2, 35) -> (2, 14) -> (8, 14) -> (8, 12) -> (14, 12) -> (14, 10).

## Verified Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Requires Surf.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable cliff face.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
- BUOY: Impassable hard wall.

## Navigation Insights
- Row 32 Highway: Clear from X=9 to X=23. Sign at (8, 32) requires detour via Row 33.
- X=12 Corridor: Clear from Row 28 to Row 44.
- X=9 Wall: Blockade from Row 34 to Row 43. Gap at Row 44.
- X=5 Wall: Blockade from Row 30 to Row 33. Gap at Row 35.
- West Beach Highway (X=2): Clear vertical path from Row 53 to Row 14.
- Plateau Entrance: Only accessible from Row 14, X=2-8. Ledge at (10, 15) blocks northern entry from Inner Channel.
