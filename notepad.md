# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Stop Team Rocket.
- **Secondary Goal:** Investigate Radio Tower (Team Rocket takeover).
- **Navigation:** Searching Goldenrod City for the Radio Tower. Checking the building at (33, 9) next.
- **Status:** Clearing Goldenrod Underground before returning to Radio Tower.
- **Info:** QUEST KNOWLEDGE AGENT CONFIRMED: No Rocket Uniform in Crystal.
- **Plan:**
    1. Battle Super Nerd Teru at (6, 9).
    2. Battle PokéManiac Donald at (2, 6).
    3. Exit Underground.
    4. Return to Radio Tower and force/battle past the Grunt at the stairs.
- **Observations:**
    - The "True Terror" text is likely just flavor or a pre-battle line. I likely just need to push through.
    - Locked door at (18, 6) likely requires a key from the Radio Tower (Basement Key?).
