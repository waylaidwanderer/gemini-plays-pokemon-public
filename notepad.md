# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Reach the Dragon Shrine via the East Whirlpool.

# Current Status (Turn 18302)
- **Location:** Dragon's Den B1F (24, 22).
- **Facing:** Down (Verified).
- **Action:** Interact with Whirlpool directly (A button).
- **Reasoning:** Previous menu attempt had no visible effect. Direct interaction is simpler and reliable if facing is correct.
- **Sequence:**
  1. `A` (Interact).
  2. `A` (Confirm "Yes").
  3. `A` (Clear Text).

# Plan
1. Clear Whirlpool at (24, 23).
2. Move South to explore the path.
3. Find a way West to reach the Dragon Shrine Entrance at (19, 29).

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Requires HM06 Whirlpool + Glacier Badge. 
- **Lava/Magma:** (None here).
- **Ice:** (None here).

# Lessons
- **Menu Navigation:** Always verify cursor position before committing to a sequence. Blind input leads to wrong menus (e.g., PACK instead of POKEMON).
