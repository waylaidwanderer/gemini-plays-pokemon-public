# Gem's Pokémon Yellow Legacy - Hard Mode Playthrough

## Current Plan: Viridian Forest - Attempt 2
- **Objective:** Successfully navigate Viridian Forest to reach Pewter City.
- **Strategy:** 
  1. Lead with a Pokémon that can reliably escape battles (check speeds).
  2. RUN from all non-essential wild encounters to conserve HP and PP.
  3. If escape fails more than once, immediately switch to a Pokémon with a type advantage to end the fight quickly.
  4. Proactively use `battle_strategist_agent` for any trainer battles or difficult wild encounters.

## Party Status
- **All members healthy** after blacking out.

## Lessons from the Blackout (Viridian Forest Wipeout)
- **Catastrophic Failure:** A series of poor decisions led to a full party wipe against a single Lv8 Pidgey.
- **Failed Tactic (Running):** Attempting to run 3+ times while taking damage was a severe strategic error. **Lesson:** If running fails twice, switch tactics.
- **Menuing Errors:** Repeatedly failed to navigate the battle menu correctly, wasting critical turns. **Lesson:** Slow down and confirm inputs under pressure.
- **Misjudged Threat:** Incorrectly assumed Pidgey's Gust was a physical attack, making Harden useless. **Lesson:** Do not assume move types; be prepared for both physical and special attacks.
- **Agent Misuse:** Failed to use `battle_strategist_agent` proactively. **Lesson:** Use agents to inform strategy from the start, not as a last resort.
