## Map: Team Rocket Base B2F (3_50)
- **Path to West:** Column 23 wall is bypassed via Row 16 (FLOOR).

  - (3, 14): Ladder to B1F.
  - (27, 14): Ladder to B3F (Eastern section).
- **Objects:**
  - (14, 12), (15, 12): Locked Doors to Transmitter Room.
  - (14, 9): Radio Transmitter.
  - (21, 14): Rocket Grunt (Defeated).

- **Strategy (How):**
  1. Move West along Row 16 to reach the western half of B2F.

  3. Enter B3F West to confront the Boss.

## Map: Team Rocket Base B3F (3_51)
- **Observations:**
  - Row 11: WALL from (1, 11) to (13, 11) isolates the Boss Room (10, 9).
  - Eastern section (reachable via ladder at 27, 14) is a dead end for reaching the Boss.
  - Western section items: X Special (3, 12), Protein (1, 12). Both collected.

# Lessons Learned
- Item sprites and COUNTER tiles have collision; interact from adjacent FLOOR.
- Map sections can be completely isolated; look for alternative floor transitions.
