# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) in Cianwood City to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The West Beach Highway (Land Route)
- Plan:
  1. Walk to (23, 51) via (23, 33) and (21, 42). [IN PROGRESS]
  2. Walk West along Row 51 to (2, 51).
  3. Walk North along West Beach (X=2) to (2, 12).
  4. Walk East along Row 12 to (14, 12).
  5. Walk North to (14, 10).
- Reasoning: City is partitioned by vertical walls. Row 51 is the only confirmed land bridge from the east side to the West Beach (X=2). X=2 is a clear vertical highway that bypasses the Row 15 wall/ledge barrier. Row 12 provides horizontal access back to the center for the sighting.

# Blocked Routes (Verified)
- Central City: Vertical walls at X=5, X=9, X=11, X=17.
- Row 15 Barrier: Solid wall/ledge from X=3 to X=17.
- Row 30/34/46 Barriers: Impassable cliffs (FLOOR_UP_WALL).

# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard ground. Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Surf required. Traversable.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable cliff face.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
