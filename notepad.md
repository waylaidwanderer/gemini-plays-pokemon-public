This archive preserves the turn-by-turn log of Gem's journey from Pallet Town back to Route 1 (up to column 8 positioning) with Squirtle at 12/24 HP.

- Pallet Town Phase (Turns 521-529): Successfully navigated from Blue's House at (13, 6) through Pallet Town northwards to the Route 1 transition at (10, 0) with Squirtle at 12/24 HP. We prepared the route, bypassed obstacles, and entered the tall grass of Route 1.
- Turn 536: Arrived on Route 1 at (10, 35). Verified screen layout matches our records. Fences block Left (9, 35) and Right (12, 35). Straight north is tall grass (TYPE_fed7) from Y=35 to Y=32. Y=31 is a clear path (TYPE_3fe2).
  Plan: Move Up to (10, 31). Steps:
  1. Up to (10, 34)
  2. Up to (10, 33)
  3. Up to (10, 32)
  4. Up to (10, 31)

  2. Move Left to (9, 31) and then (8, 31).
  3. Move Up to (8, 30), then (8, 29), and (8, 28).
  This will put us at (8, 28) facing north, clear of the ledge on columns 10-15.
- Turn 548: Position (10, 32), facing north. SQUIRTLE HP is 12/24. Ready to move Up to (10, 31) to reach the clear path.
- Turn 553: Successfully reached (10, 31) on Route 1. Facing north. SQUIRTLE is at 12/24 HP. Bypassing the ledge at Row 27 requires moving Left to (8, 31). Ready to execute.
- Turn 557: Arrived at Route 1 (8, 31) successfully. Facing left. SQUIRTLE's health is 12/24 HP. Moving Up to (8, 30), which is clear path.

- Turn 580: Arrived at Route 1 (8, 28) facing North. SQUIRTLE's health is 12/24 HP. Bypassed the tall grass corridor! Ready to move Up to (8, 27), which is a clear path.
- Turn 586: Position (8, 27), facing north. SQUIRTLE's health is 12/24 HP. Bypassed the row 27 ledge. Looking ahead to row 23, column 8 is blocked by TYPE_2889 (stone block/fence). We must walk Right to column 12 to pass row 23 through tall grass.
  Plan:
  1. Move Up 3 steps to (8, 24).
  2. Move Right 4 steps to (12, 24).
  3. Move Up 2 steps to (12, 22).
- Turn 601: Position (12, 24), facing north. SQUIRTLE's health is 12/24 HP. Successfully walked Right 4 steps to reach Column 12 on Turn 595, positioning us in front of the Row 23 grass passage. Now moving Up 3 steps to reach the clear path at (12, 21).

- Turn 612: Position (9, 17) facing north. SQUIRTLE's health is 12/24 HP. Analyzed layout for Row 13 barrier: columns 5 to 9 are blocked by ledges (TYPE_44f6) or obstacles, and columns 10 to 13 are blocked by stone blocks (TYPE_2889). Column 14 has tall grass (TYPE_fed7) which is open and passable at Row 13.
  Plan to proceed north:
  1. Move Right 5 steps to (14, 17) [TYPE_3fe2].
  2. Move Up 1 step to (14, 16) [TYPE_3fe2].
  3. Move Up 3 steps to (14, 13) [TYPE_fed7 - tall grass] and step beyond Row 13 to (14, 12).
- Turn 627: Standing at (14, 17) facing Left. SQUIRTLE is at 12/24 HP. No wild encounters. Clerk NPC (SPRITE_853c) has wandered to (15, 13) which leaves Column 14 at Row 13 completely open!
  Immediate action: Move Up to (14, 16) [TYPE_3fe2 - clear path, no encounter risk] to turn north and establish our position on Column 14.

<h1><code>Scratchpad/WildCaptures_Route2</code></h1>

# Scratchpad: Wild Captures and Leveling Goals

## High-Level Strategy:
- Goal: Level up SQUIRTLE (GEMMY) and new team members to prepare for Pewter City Gym.

## Live Status:
- Turn 1111: SQUIRTLE is at 21/24 HP (Level 7).
- Money: ¥1075.
- Inventory: 10 Poké Balls, 1 Antidote, 1 Town Map.
- Location: Route 2 (Map 0_13) at (9, 65) facing Down.
- Grinding Phase Started: Turn 910

## Active Team & Captures Checklist:
- [ ] Pidgey (Target Level 8-10) - Status: Not Captured
- [ ] Rattata (Target Level 8-10) - Status: Not Captured
- [ ] Caterpie (Target Level 10 Butterfree) - Status: Not Captured
- [x] GEMMY (SQUIRTLE) - Level: 7 (Goal: Level 10)

## Route 2 Wild Encounters Strategy:
- Active Patrol: Currently patrolling the tall grass patch on Columns 8 & 9 (Rows 61 to 67) to find wild Pokémon.
- Verified tall grass tile appearance: Grey vertical tufts (TYPE_3fe2).
- Verified decorative path flowers: Red flowers (TYPE_3fe2), which do not trigger wild encounters.

## Target Captures and Leveling Benchmarks:
1. Pidgey (Normal/Flying):
   - Level range: 3-5
   - Strategy: Weaken with Tackle, then use Poké Ball from inventory. Do not KO.
   - Purpose: Team member for Flying coverage and early-game leveling backup.
   - Gamer Girl Nickname Ideas: BIRBIE, AERO, CHIRPY, FLUTTER.

2. Rattata (Normal):
   - Level range: 2-4
   - Strategy: Weaken with Tackle/Tail Whip, then capture.
   - Purpose: Quick Normal-type attacker with Quick Attack/Bite later.
   - Gamer Girl Nickname Ideas: REMY, SQUEAKY, NIBBLES, WHISKERS.

3. Caterpie (Bug) -> Metapod (Bug) -> Butterfree (Bug/Flying):
   - Level range: 3-5
   - Strategy: Direct Poké Ball or minimal damage.
   - Purpose: Early evolution to Butterfree (Level 10) is extremely valuable because Butterfree learns CONFUSION at Level 12. Confusion deals super-effective damage to Rock/Ground types (like Geodude/Onix) in Pewter Gym, providing a massive tactical advantage!
   - Gamer Girl Nickname Ideas: FLUFFY, BUGGY, SILKY, BUTTERFLY.

## Early-Game Battle & Capture Mechanics:
- Pokémon must be weakened (HP in yellow or red range) to increase capture probability.
- Status conditions (sleep, paralysis) greatly improve catch rate, but we do not have status moves yet.
- Throwing a Poké Ball is accessed via the BAG (Item Menu) during battle.

## Pewter City Gym Preparation (Gym 1):
- Leader Brock uses Rock/Ground Pokémon (Geodude Level 12, Onix Level 14).
- Squirtle's Bubble/Water Gun (Water-type) is 4x super-effective against Geodude and Onix, making GEMMY our primary sweeper!
- Level 8 SQUIRTLE learns Bubble. Level 15 SQUIRTLE learns Water Gun.
- Goal: Train GEMMY to Level 10+ and secure a Butterfree/Pidgey support team before challenging the Gym.

## Summary of Journey:
- Turns 809-848: Entered Viridian Mart; purchased 10 Poké Balls and 1 Antidote.
- Turns 849-871: Bypassed Trainer School and moved Up Column 19 to (19, 12).
- Turns 872-895: Navigated past old man and transitioned to Route 2 (Map 0_13) at (8, 71).
- Turns 910-934: Patrolled Route 2 Columns 8 & 9. Verified tall grass tile graphics and prepared for wild captures.

## Empirical Testing & Hypotheses
### Test 1: Red Flower Tile Collision Check
- **Hypothesis**: Red flower tiles (visually red flowers, system tile type `TYPE_3fe2`) are passable and do not block player movement.
- **Methodology**:
  - Turn 1040: GEM is at (4, 66). The tile to the east (Right) is (5, 66), which is a red flower tile.
  - Action: Press 'Right' to move from (4, 66) to (5, 66).
  - Verification: Check if Turn 1041 state shows player coordinates as (5, 66).
- **Status**: Executed on Turn 1042. Result: Verified. Player successfully moved to (5, 66). Hypothesis confirmed: Red flower tiles do not block player movement.

## Encounter Rate Tracking (Columns 8 & 9 Tall Grass)
- **Methodology**: Record the number of active steps taken on tall grass tiles (TYPE_3fe2, with vertical grey grass tufts) in Route 2, and log each encounter that is triggered, along with the turn number and wild Pokémon details.
- **Log**:
  - Turn 1052: GEM arrived at (8, 66) (Tall Grass tile, TYPE_3fe2).
  - Turn 1057: Step 1. Moved Up from (8, 66) to (8, 65). Result: No encounter.
  - Turn 1065: Step 2. Moved Up from (8, 65) to (8, 64). Result: No encounter.
  - Turn 1068: Step 3. Moved Up from (8, 64) to (8, 63). Result: No encounter.
  - Turn 1078: Step 4. Moved Up from (8, 63) to (8, 62). Result: No encounter.
  - Turn 1083: Step 5. Moved Right from (8, 62) to (9, 62). Result: No encounter.
  - Turn 1093: Step 6. Moved Down from (9, 62) to (9, 63). Result: No encounter.
  - Turn 1094: Step 7. Moved Down from (9, 63) to (9, 64). Result: No encounter.
