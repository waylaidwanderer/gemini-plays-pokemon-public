# Exploration Targets
- Route 42 middle area (Apricorn trees) for Suicune sighting.
- Unseen tiles on Route 42: (33, 15), (24, 17).

# Lessons Learned
- Roamer vs. Scripted: In Pokemon Crystal, Suicune is NOT a roamer like Raikou/Entei. It has fixed overworld locations. Trying to "intercept" it with a Repel trick is a waste of time. (Turn 16921)

# Task History
- Scripted Suicune Hunt: Started Turn 16921. Pivot from roamer strategy.

# Progress Update (Turn 16940)
- Successfully used Surf on Route 42. Moving towards the middle island for the Suicune encounter.

# Progress Update (Turn 16944)
- Positioned at (24, 12), facing the Cut tree at (24, 13). Initiating Cut to access the southern island area for the Suicune encounter.
