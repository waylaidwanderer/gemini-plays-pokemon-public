### Strategic Reflection (Turn 8719)
- **Status**: Stuck in Goldenrod for ~100 turns.
- **Issue**: Oscillating between East/West without clearing the "fog of war".
- **Insight**: The North-East (Flower Shop) is a cul-de-sac. The Central North Wall seems solid. The only remaining option is the North-West quadrant, which is largely "unseen".
- **Action Plan**: 
    1. Return to Main Street (y=10).
    2. Move West to x=6.
    3.Systematically explore North from there, hugging the West edge.

### Navigation Notes
- **Location**: Goldenrod City (Central -> South).
- **Goal**: Reach Far West Side (North of Tracks).
- **Status**: Heading to East Crossing (18, 14) to cross to the South Side.
- **Reasoning**: The North-Central area is walled off. The West side (x=6) was a dead end. I must loop South to the Radio Tower area and check for a Far West crossing or path (x=0-4).
- **Plan**:
    1. Cross Tracks at (18, 14).
    2. Travel West to Radio Tower (5, 15).
    3. Search for a path North along the extreme West edge (x=0).

### Quest Chain: SquirtBottle
1. **Defeat Whitney**: Done (Plain Badge obtained).
2. **Find Floria**: Currently seeking at Route 36.
3. **Get Bottle**: Return to Flower Shop after meeting Floria.

### Key Locations
- **East Crossing**: (18, 14).
- **Radio Tower**: (5, 15).
- **Target Area**: Far West (x=0, y<10).
