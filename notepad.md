# Suicune Capture Strategy
## The Repel Trick
- **Lead:** KIMCHI (Lv 21 Gloom).
- **Setup:** Super Repel filters wild Pokemon (Lv 13-16). Suicune (Lv 40) is the only possible encounter.
- **Status:** Super Repel active (Used Turn #13578). ~160 steps remaining.
- **Inventory:** Super Repel x6 (Item 15 in PACK).

## Battle Strategy (vs Suicune Lv 40)
- **Mechanics:** Suicune (Base Speed 85) flees on its first turn. KIMCHI (Base Speed 40) is slower.
- **Flee Logic:** Roamers flee on their first active turn if not asleep or trapped.
- **Strategy:** Chipping HP and inflicting status (Sleep) is persistent across encounters. Use Sleep Powder every encounter.
- **Catch Rate:** ~0.39% (Full HP, Great Ball). Increases to ~4.3% when asleep. Verified by suicune_capture_analyst_v2.
- **Contingency:** If progress stalls (5 encounters), catch a faster trapper (e.g., Haunter for Mean Look).

## Route 38 Navigation
- **Roamer Logic:** Suicune moves routes ONLY when crossing map boundaries (Route 38/39 edge), using Fly, or after a battle.
- **Boundary:** Route 38 (0, 10) <-> Route 39 (19, 10).
- **Observation:** Suicune confirmed on Route 38 (Turn #13572). Tully call (Turn #13584) did not move it.
