# Current Objectives
*   **Primary Goal:** Obtain the Boulder Badge from the Pewter City Gym Leader, Brock.
*   **Secondary Goal:** Secure funds by exploring Route 3 to heal FLAREE.
*   **Tertiary Goal:** Explore Route 3 for resources and experience.

# Game Mechanics & Strategy
*   **Ledge Mechanics:** One-way (downwards only). Cannot move UP onto a ledge from a lower Y.
*   **Movement Mechanic:** 1st press TURNS if not facing, 2nd press MOVES. **Pikachu Movement:** Pikachu does not block movement. If not facing Pikachu and attempting to move onto Pikachu's tile, the first directional input *towards* Pikachu causes the player to turn and face Pikachu. A *second* directional input towards Pikachu is then required to step onto Pikachu's tile. This applies only when moving *into* Pikachu's current tile; normal movement applies otherwise. If already facing Pikachu, one press moves onto the tile.
*   **Level Cap:** 0 badges = Lv12. EXP gain stops at cap. Wild battles give no money.
*   **Data Trust:** Game State Information is absolute truth.
*   **Pathing:** Validate agent paths with `move_validator_agent` or use short, verifiable segments.
*   **Map Marker Usage:** üö´ (dead ends/impassable), üìç (nav points), üö™ (used warps), ‚ò†Ô∏è (defeated trainers), ‚ùó/üíÅ (event NPCs/blockers), üöß (ledges).
*   **Battle Strategy:** Use `select_battle_option` tool for main battle menu. Remember to switch Pok√©mon for EXP distribution (e.g., lead with lower level Pok√©mon like FLAREE).

# Party Updates (Viridian Forest - Turn 4818)
*   FLAREE (VULPIX): Lv8 (6/26 HP, EXP: 704) | Moves: EMBER (12 PP), TAIL WHIP (30 PP), QUICK ATTACK (30 PP) - Critically low HP. Training is too risky. Must be kept benched and safe until healed. Prioritize earning money for healing.
*   SPBARKY (PIKACHU): Lv12 (38/39 HP, EXP: 1728) | Moves: THUNDERSHOCK (29 PP), TAIL WHIP (30 PP), QUICK ATTACK (30 PP), THUNDER WAVE (20 PP) (Level Cap Reached)
*   SPROUT (ODDISH): Lv12 (33/37 HP, EXP: 973) | Moves: TACKLE (30 PP), POISONPOWDER (35 PP), LEECH SEED (10 PP) (Level Cap Reached)

# Post-Viridian Forest Plan Notes
*   Party reordered to lead with FLAREE (Complete).
*   Solidify plan for acquiring funds on Route 2/Pewter City: identify specific trainers to battle or item sale strategy.

# Key Journey Events & Map Discoveries
*   **Viridian Forest Training (Current):** SPROUT reached Lv12 cap. FLAREE gaining EXP from wild battles. Navigating towards northern exit.
*   **Pewter City Navigation:** Repeatedly blocked by Youngster escort event and dynamic tile changes. Learned to use `map_analyzer_agent` and validate paths. Pewter PC non-functional.
*   **Route 2:** Caught FLAREE (Vulpix). Navigated ledges.
*   **Viridian Forest (Previous):** Trained SPROUT to Lv12. Defeated Bug Catchers & Youngsters. Encountered several non-battling NPC blockers. Noted impassable tiles: (9,27), (11,27), (13,31), (19,21), (25,17), (27,18 sign), (28,45), (29,21), (15,47), (17,33 sign), (16,32), (20,36), Youngster (ID1) at (17,44) is a blocker.
*   **Viridian City Pokecenter Navigation:** Multiple attempts to reach Pokecenter due to ledges and impassable walls. Eventually succeeded.

# Agent & Pathing Notes
*   **`map_analyzer_agent` Issues:** Provided flawed paths multiple times. Paths need strict validation (use `move_validator_agent`) or execution in smaller, verifiable segments. Prompt needs update (navigability, warps).
*   **`exploration_planner_agent` Limitation:** Failed to path to known exit when no unseen tiles. Prompt needs update for direct pathing scenarios.

# Agent Management (Pewter Pokecenter - Turn 4933)
*   **High Priority Agents Defined/Updated:** `scripted_event_tracker_agent`, `route_progress_analyzer_agent`, `battle_log_analyzer_agent`, `map_analyzer_agent` (prompt updated), `exploration_planner_agent` (prompt updated).
*   **Agents Deleted to Make Space:** `item_finder_agent`, `pokedex_completer_agent`.
*   **Remaining Agent Ideas/TODOs:**
    *   `notepad_query_agent`: Defined.
    *   `rom_hack_mechanics_discoverer_agent`: Hypothesizes game mechanics from observed anomalies. (Define/Discard)
    *   `potion_purchase_optimizer_agent`: Optimizes healing item purchases based on funds and needs. (Define/Discard)
    *   `battle_strategy_advisor_agent`: Suggests moves in battle based on type matchups, PP, HP, etc. (LOWER PRIORITY - Define after funds secured and party healed). (Define/Discard)
    *   Review prompts for `team_builder_agent` for Hard Mode relevance or delete if space is needed.
*   **Agents Defined/Deleted (Recent):** `notepad_query_agent` (Defined Turn 5004), `leveling_training_advisor_agent` (Deleted Turn 5003), `exploration_planner` (old version) (Deleted Turn 5002).

# Inventory & Finances
*   POK√© BALL x1
*   Money: ¬•156 (Critically Low)

# Pokedex Status
*   Caught: 3/151 (PIKACHU, ODDISH, VULPIX)

# Viridian Forest Notes
*   Blocked at (19,21) (impassable) when trying to move South from (19,20). Tile (20,20) also confirmed impassable.
*   Blocked at (11,20) (impassable) when trying to move Left from (12,20).
*   Blocked at (6,2) (impassable) when trying to move Left from (7,2).

# Party & Gameplay Notes (Post-Turn 4994)
*   Current Party Order: SPARKY (lead), FLAREE, SPROUT.
*   Menu Navigation: Investigate issues with Pok√©mon switching menu sequence. Game seems to process only one button press at a time if it changes menu state. Be methodical with single button presses in complex menus.

# Route 2 Exploration (Turn 5047)
*   Explored northern section of Route 2 (south of Pewter City connection). No trainers found.
*   Explored southern section of Route 2 (north of Viridian City connection, up to VF North Gate). No trainers found.

# Pewter City Navigation & Events
*   **Youngster Gym Escort Event:** Youngster NPC (ID 5), typically found near eastern side of city (e.g., (36,17), (35,17), (38,19)), triggers an escort to the Gym entrance at (12,19) or other nearby locations. Dialogue: "If you have the right stuff, go take on BROCK!". This NPC does not battle. Known trigger zones include (38,19), (35,17), (30,19), (34,19), (36,18). Strategy: Use a more southerly route (e.g., row 21) to head east and use `scripted_event_tracker_agent` frequently.
    *   Turn 5222: `stun_npc` on Youngster (ID 5) did NOT prevent his scripted escort event from triggering at (34,19) on Turn 5223. `stun_npc` may not work on all scripted events.
    *   Turn 5241: `scripted_event_tracker_agent` warned at (31,20) of proximity to trigger 'Youngster_Escort_Pewter' at (30,19) (radius 2).
    *   Turn 5246-5247: Youngster (ID 5) escort event triggered at (36,18). Player moved from (36,18) to (12,19) in front of Gym.
*   **Dynamic Tile Changes (Summary):** Certain tiles in Pewter City change between ground and impassable states. Notable areas:
    *   Column 35 (Rows 15, 16, 20, 21, 22, 23).
    *   (34,20) (Police Notice Sign, often impassable).
    *   Column 27 (Rows 15, 16, 17, 18).
*   **Known Impassable Areas/Blockers:**
    *   Column X=22: (22,22), (22,25), (22,26), (22,27).
    *   Police Notice Sign at (34,20).
    *   Pewter PC non-functional.
*   **Pewter City Trainers (All Non-Battling for Funds / Already Defeated):**
    *   JR.TRAINER‚ôÇ (Cool Trainer M) in Gym: Defeated (Turn 4004), ¬•180.
    *   Gym Leader Brock: Lost (Turn 4016).
    *   Cool Trainer M (ID 2) at (18,26): Non-battling.
    *   Super Nerd (ID 4, PEWTERCITY_SUPER_NERD2) at (24,26): Non-battling.
    *   Super Nerd (ID 3, PEWTERCITY_SUPER_NERD1) at (28,18): Non-battling.

# Hindsight & Lessons Learned (Consolidated)
*   **Data Integrity:** Prioritize XML map data over screen annotations for tile properties.
*   **NPCs & Interaction:** Verify NPC locations using `Map Sprites` data *each turn*. Use `npc_interaction_planner_agent` proactively.
*   **Pathing & Navigation:** For long/complex paths, use `move_validator_agent` or break into smaller, verifiable segments. Prioritize exploring closer alternatives before extensive backtracking. Be extremely cautious around known scripted event triggers; use `scripted_event_tracker_agent` frequently or plan significantly wider detours.
*   **Agent Strategy:** Act on planned agent definitions/updates promptly. Proactively use query agents. Trust agent pathing logic more; refine prompts if outputs are problematic.
*   **Risk Management:** Avoid multiple risky battles with critically low HP Pok√©mon. Prioritize healing.
*   **Notepad Edits:** Ensure `old_text` for "replace" actions is exact.

# Reflection & Action Plan (Turn 5253)
*   **Agent Decisions:**
    *   Define `potion_purchase_optimizer_agent` (next priority action).
    *   Keep `rom_hack_mechanics_discoverer_agent` as a low-priority idea.
    *   Keep `battle_strategy_advisor_agent` as a low-priority idea (for after funds/healing).
    *   `team_builder_agent` prompt reviewed, seems adequate for Hard Mode considerations for now.
*   **Agent Usage Reminders:**
    *   Use `route_progress_analyzer_agent` upon reaching Route 3.
    *   Use `battle_log_analyzer_agent` after the next significant trainer battle.
    *   Use `move_validator_agent` for complex/risky pathing segments, especially in areas with dynamic elements or known events.
    *   Be more diligent with `scripted_event_tracker_agent` around Youngster (ID 5) in Pewter City; consider more frequent checks or wider detours if warned.
*   **Map Marker Tasks (Pewter City, Map ID 2 unless specified):**
    *   **Add ‚ùó (Event Trigger/Obstacle):**
        *   (36,17) - Youngster (ID 5) Escort Trigger
        *   (35,17) - Youngster (ID 5) Escort Trigger
        *   (30,19) - Youngster (ID 5) Escort Trigger
        *   (34,19) - Youngster (ID 5) Escort Trigger
        *   (36,18) - Youngster (ID 5) Escort Trigger
        *   (34,20) - Police Notice Sign (Dynamic Obstacle)
    *   **Add ‚ò†Ô∏è (Defeated Trainer):**
        *   PEWTER_GYM (Map ID 3), (4,7) - JR.TRAINER‚ôÇ (Cool Trainer M)
    *   **Delete Redundant üö´ Markers (where tile type is already 'impassable' in XML and marker adds no new info):**
        *   (32,13), (18,15), (23,18), (19,20), (12,22), (14,22), (23,24), (31,25), (13,26), (15,26), (20,30), (30,24), (31,28), (19,19), (26,18), (35,26), (23,17)
*   **Strategic Notes:**
    *   Prioritize avoiding Youngster (ID 5) escort event. Current strategy: use southern route (row 21) to head east in Pewter City.
    *   Clear dialogue prompts fully before attempting multi-step movements.
*   **Goal Revisions (Reflected in current JSON output):**
    *   Secondary Goal: Acquire sufficient funds to heal FLAREE and purchase essential supplies.
    *   Tertiary Goal: Gain EXP for non-capped Pok√©mon and find useful items on Route 3.
