## Strategy: Reaching Suicune Overworld Sighting
**Start Turn:** 48900 (Quest: Trigger Suicune Overworld Sighting)

Cianwood's geography is a maze of buoy walls and one-way ledges. I am using the Inner Channel gaps to reach the northern plateau.

### Step-by-Step Execution Plan
1. Use Super Repel and Surf North from (27, 38).
2. Surf North to (28, 15), then West to (23, 15) (Row 15 gap).
3. Surf South to (23, 16), then West to (21, 16) (X=22 gap).
4. Surf South to (21, 26), then West to (17, 26) (X=18 gap).
5. Surf North in the Inner Channel to (17, 16), then West to land at (13, 16).
6. Walk to the plateau: (13, 16) -> (11, 16) -> (11, 14) -> (8, 14) -> (8, 12) -> (14, 12) -> (14, 10).
7. Trigger Suicune sighting at (14, 10).

## Tile Mechanics: Cianwood City
- FLOOR: Standard ground.
- WALL: Impassable barrier.
- WATER: Surf required.
- BUOY: Impassable water barrier.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way ledge. Blocks DOWN movement. Allows UP and East-West movement. (Verified at (6, 46)).

## Navigation: Verified Gaps
- X=26 Wall: Gap at Row 10-15.
- X=22 Wall: Gap at Row 16-24.
- X=18 Wall: Gap at Row 26.
- Row 15 Wall: Gap at (23, 15) and (11, 14).

## Failed Hypotheses & Lessons
- Row 8 Bypass: Blocked by BUOY at (26, 8).
- Terrestrial Row 52: Blocked by WATER at (23, 32).
- Row 21/18 Gaps (X=18): Blocked by BUOY at (18, 21) and (18, 18).

## Inventory Check
- Super Repel: 5 remaining. Last applied turn 49342.
- Party: Calcifer (Lv 64) leads. Ready for Eusine.
