# Quest Log
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Status:** Exploring Mt. Silver Cave 1F.
- **Next:** Traverse Cave to Red.

# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Location:** Silver Cave Room 1.
- **Status:** Executing Grand Loop.
- **Start Time:** Turn 25238 (Jan 6, 2026).
- **Action:** Navigate to (15, 35), then West to (0, 35).
- **Reasoning:** Northward progress is blocked on all columns (0, 3, 8, 15) by one-way ledges (Row 14, 20, 25). The only viable path to the North appears to be Column 0, which connects to the bottom corridor (Row 35). To reach (0, 35), I must loop through the East side (Col 15) via the gap at Row 26, then head South to Row 35.
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.

# Tile Mechanics

- **LEDGE_HOP_LEFT:** One-way Left.
- **WARP_CARPET:** Step on to exit map.
- **CUT_TREE:** Obstacle unless Cut is used.

- **LADDER:** Transitions between floors.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Walkable from South/Sides. Northbound exit is BLOCKED (Verified at 8,14). Acts as a one-way ledge preventing Northward movement.
- **BUOY:** Water boundary/Wall.
