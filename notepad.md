# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Timestamp:** Turn 25602 (Jan 6, 2026)
- **Primary Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Immediate Task:** Reach the Northwest area of Silver Cave Outside.
- Current Location: Silver Cave Outside (35, 33). Bottom Area.
- Observation: Successfully navigated from the SE corner.
- Goal: Reach Pokemon Center at (23, 19).
- Obstacle: Row 30 appears to be a line of ledges/walls. I need to find a gap or a path North.
- Plan:
    1. Travel West to (23, 33).
    2. Check if I can walk North at x=23 or adjacent columns.
    3. If blocked, check further West or East for a gap in the Row 30 barrier.

# Tile Mechanics & Observations
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT:** Standard one-way jumpable tiles.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Inconsistent behavior observed.
    - **Confirmed Ledge:** (39, 32) allowed jumping South.
    - **Confirmed Wall:** (6, 30) and (28, 34) blocked movement South.
    - **Strategy:** Treat as WALL unless verified otherwise.
- **Navigation Notes:**
    - The "Central" area (x=5) connects to the West path via Row 22 (re-verified via Mental Map).
    - Row 30 acts as a hard barrier across most of the map, separating the North and South sections.
