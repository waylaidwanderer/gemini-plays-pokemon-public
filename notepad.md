# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Standard walkable tile.
- WALL: Impassable collision (pillars, statues, rocks, NPCs).
- LADDER: Two-way warp between floors. (1, 7) and (7, 9).
- PIT: A hole that leads to 1F. Boulders fall through to fill gaps on 1F. Empty pits are impassable/warp for player on 2F.
- BOULDER: Pushable object. Requires STRENGTH. Pushing moves it one tile. Player STAYS in original tile. (Verified Turn 34566)

- Boulder 6: (3, 3) starting position.
- Boulder 7: (6, 1) starting position.
- Boulder 8: (8, 14) starting position.
- Pit 1: (8, 3)
- Pit 2: (2, 5)
