# Lessons Learned
- **Tool Insight:** `navigate_menu` sends multiple inputs per command (simulating hold). DO NOT use for responsive menus like the Start Menu; it causes over-scrolling. Use `slow_press` for precise menu navigation.
- **Automation vs. Interruptions:** Phone calls/events freeze the game, desyncing fixed-input sequences. Monitor and manually reset.
- **Efficiency:** "Checking with your face" (running into grass) is faster than checking the Pokedex for Roamers.
