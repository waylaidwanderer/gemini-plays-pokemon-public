# I. Game Mechanics & Traversal
## A. Core Rules
- **Level Cap:** 8 badges = Level 65.
- **PC Interaction:** Stand directly below the PC, face up, and press 'A'.
- **HM Usage:** HMs are used from the party menu. Fainted Pokémon can use field moves.
- **Surfing:** Not all `ground` tiles adjacent to `water` are valid starting points.
- **Puzzle Resets:** Leaving and re-entering a map (e.g., by using a ladder to another floor) resets all boulders on that map to their original positions. This was confirmed when the solved southern boulder puzzle on Victory Road 2F was reset after traveling to 3F and back.
- **Off-Screen State Changes:** An object's state will not update in the map data until it is visible on-screen.
- **Boulder Pushing:** A boulder can be pushed from an adjacent tile by facing it and pressing the corresponding direction. The game's behavior regarding player movement is highly inconsistent. Pushing a boulder usually moves the player into the boulder's vacated space, but this is not guaranteed (e.g., pushing the boulder at (5,16) left from (6,16) did not move the player). The game may also move the player to an unexpected adjacent tile (e.g., pushing a boulder at (5,15) down from (5,14) resulted in the player moving to (6,15)). This mechanic requires careful, turn-by-turn observation.

## B. Tile Glossary & Movement Rules
- `ground`: Standard walkable tile.
- `grass`: Wild Pokémon encounters.
- `water`: Requires SURF.
- `impassable`: Wall. Defeated trainers on Victory Road 1F & 2F are impassable obstacles.
- `ledge`: One-way traversal. Can only be jumped DOWN from the tile directly above. Acts as a wall from all other directions.
- `elevated_ground`: Walkable, different elevation. It is NOT possible to step down from an `elevated_ground` tile to an adjacent `ground` tile.
- `steps`: Allows movement between `ground` and `elevated_ground` in both directions.
- `boulder_switch`: Floor switch for boulders.
- `boulder_barrier`: Impassable barrier linked to a boulder switch.
- `cleared_boulder_barrier`: A former barrier that acts as a one-way ramp. It is possible to move from it onto `elevated_ground` (elevation 2), but it is NOT possible to move from it directly back down to `ground` or to enter it from ANY adjacent `ground` tile.
- `hole`: Drops to a lower floor. Pushing a boulder into one causes it to appear on the floor below.
- `spinner`: Forces movement.
- `cuttable`: A tree that can be removed with the HM Cut.
- `ladder_up`: Warps to a higher floor.
- `ladder_down`: Warps to a lower floor.

# II. Battle Intel
## A. Type Effectiveness Chart (Verified)
- **Super Effective (2x):** Psychic > Ghost, Poison; Ghost > Psychic; Electric > Rock, Water; Flying > Grass, Poison, Fighting; Ice > Ground, Grass, Flying, Dragon; Ground > Poison, Fire, Electric, Rock, Ground; Rock > Fire, Ice, Flying, Bug; Fighting > Normal, Rock, Ice; Water > Fire, Ground, Rock; Grass > Water, Ground, Rock; Bug > Grass, Poison, Psychic; Poison > Grass, Bug
- **Not Very Effective (0.5x):** Normal !> Rock; Electric !> Grass, Electric, Dragon; Rock !> Psychic; Psychic !> Psychic; Poison !> Poison, Ground, Rock, Ghost; Ice !> Water, Ice, Fire; Fighting > Poison, Flying, Psychic, Bug; Water !> Water, Grass, Dragon; Grass !> Fire, Grass, Poison, Flying, Bug, Dragon
- **Immune (0x):** Flying immune to Ground; Ground immune to Electric; Ghost immune to Normal, Fighting
- **Correction:** Psychic-type moves deal NEUTRAL (1x) damage to Rock-type Pokémon.

## B. Strategic Notes
- **"No Will to Fight" Message:** A party menu cursor error on a fainted Pokémon, not a refusal to battle.
- **Struggle Mechanic:** Struggle is only used automatically when a Pokémon is out of PP for ALL of its moves.
- **Full Heal Mechanic:** This item ONLY cures status conditions. It does NOT restore HP. This was verified by attempting to use it on multiple injured Pokémon with no status effects, which resulted in the message 'It won't have any effect.'

# III. Current Strategy: Escape Victory Road
- **Status:** Party is heavily injured. NEPTUNE has fainted.
- **High-Level Goal:** Navigate through Victory Road to reach the Indigo Plateau Pokémon Center to heal.
- **Immediate Obstacle:** The path is blocked by a boulder barrier at (8, 9). I have realized that traveling between floors resets the boulder puzzles. I am currently re-solving the southern boulder puzzle. I have pushed the boulder from (5, 15) down to (5, 16).

# IV. Tool & Agent Principles
- **Scientific Method:** Use a scientific approach: form a hypothesis, test it, and document the conclusion. Do not modify tools to test hypotheses; test them with in-game actions first.
- **Trust System Feedback:** System feedback (like validation warnings or tool errors) is the source of truth and MUST be trusted over personal assumptions or agent outputs.
- **IMMEDIATE ACTION:** Flaws in tools or data management (notepad, markers) must be addressed immediately, not deferred as goals.

# V. Archived Lessons
- **Victory Road 1F Puzzle:** Solved.
- **Victory Road 2F Puzzle (Southern Boulder):** Solved. The southern boulder was pushed to its switch, opening the barrier at (8, 9).

# VI. Future Development Ideas
- **`pathfinder_test_harness` tool:** Create a dedicated tool to run the pathfinder with specific inputs in a controlled environment for more efficient debugging.
- **`meta-debugging_agent`:** Create an agent to orchestrate the debugging cycle: run tool, get log, call debugger agent, and suggest a fix. This would automate the repetitive process I just went through.
