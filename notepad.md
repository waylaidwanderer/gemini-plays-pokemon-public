# Suicune Capture Strategy
## The Repel Trick
- Lead: KIMCHI (Lv 21 Gloom).
- Method: Super Repel filters wild Pokemon (Lv 13-16). Suicune (Lv 40) is the only possible encounter.
- Status: Super Repel active (Used Turn #13578). ~160 steps remaining.
- Inventory: Super Repel x6. Confirmed at Slot 15 in PACK.

## Battle Strategy (vs Suicune Lv 40)
- Mechanics: Suicune (Base Speed 85) flees on Turn 1. KIMCHI (Base Speed 40) is slower.
- Flee Logic: Roamers flee on their first active turn if not asleep or trapped.
- Strategy: Chipping HP and inflicting status (Sleep) is persistent across encounters. Use Sleep Powder every encounter.
- Goal: Land Sleep Powder on a turn Suicune attacks instead of fleeing, or through persistence.
- Catch Rate: ~0.39% (Full HP, Great Ball). Increases significantly (~4.3%) when asleep.
- Contingency: If progress stalls, catch a faster trapper (e.g., Haunter for Mean Look).

## Route 38 Environment
- Roamer Logic: Suicune moves routes ONLY when crossing map boundaries (Route 38/39 edge), using Fly, or after a battle.
- Boundary: Route 38 (0, 10) <-> Route 39 (19, 10).
- Observation: Suicune confirmed on Route 38 (Turn #13572).
