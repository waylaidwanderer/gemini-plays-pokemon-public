### Current Status
- **Location**: Flower Shop (Goldenrod City).
- **Badge**: Plain Badge (Obtained).
- **Key Items**: Radio Card, Bicycle, Coin Case, Plain Badge.

### Objectives
1. Get SquirtBottle.
2. Go to Route 34 (Daycare).
3. Defeat Sudowoodo (Route 36).

### Tile Mechanics
- TYPE_3fe2: Floor (Walkable)
- TYPE_63e2: Wall/Planter (Blocked)
- TYPE_ffbb: Warp/Door (Walkable)
- Plan: Exit house. This was NOT the gatehouse. Search for the real Gatehouse. It must be a large building on the North edge, likely central (x=10 to x=20). The Flower Shop blocked x=17, so try slightly West (x=10-15) or check if the 'Station' acts as a pass-through.
