# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Investigate Mahogany Town (Radio Signal).
- **Secondary Goal:** Find Lance in Mahogany Town.
- **Navigation:** Team Rocket Hideout B1F - Bypass Security.

## Quest Log
- **Lake of Rage:**
    - Caught Red Gyarados (QAAGMAQNJW).
    - Met Lance. He revealed a radio broadcast from Mahogany Town is forcing Magikarp to evolve.
    - Lance is heading to Mahogany to investigate.
- **Goldenrod:**
    - Basement of Dept Store is accessible? Need to check Underground.
- **Deliveries:**
    - Kenya (Spearow) with Mail -> Route 31 Fisher (Failed).

## Team Management
- **Party:** Muscle (42), Garnet (28), Lapis (12), Mistral (13), Kenya (11), Belladonna (5).
- **Box 1:** Red Gyarados (30).
- **Idea:** Swap a weak member (Belladonna/Kenya) for Red Gyarados (Water/Flying) for better power?

## World Knowledge
- **Mahogany Town:** Suspicious Mart with locked stairs. Lance's destination.
- **Lake of Rage:** Red Scale obtained.
- **Route 43:** Connects Lake of Rage (North) to Mahogany Town (South). Gatehouse avoids toll.

## Mechanics
- **Fly:** Cycles towns (Up/Down).
- **Hidden Items:** Check suspicious tiles.
- **Menu Navigation:** Cursor remembers position. Verify before pressing A.

## Global Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WARP_CARPET: Map transition.
- STAIRS: Change floor.
- **Mahogany Mart:** Entered. Met Lance (6, 3). He confirmed the radio signal source is here.
    - Suspicious hidden stairs likely at (7, 3).
    - Plan: Talk to Lance to proceed.
- **Security:** Triggered 'Intruder Alert' at (24, 3). Persian Statues at (24, 1) and (24, 5) are sensors. Infinite Rocket Grunt battles will occur until a secret switch is tripped.
- **Hypothesis:** The switch might be on one of the statues or a computer terminal. Testing statue at (24, 1).
- Muscle grew to Lv 43. Replacing Karate Chop with Cross Chop (Power upgrade).
- Observation: Row 4 appears to be a solid wall of blocks (Tiles 20-29).
- Observation: Warp at (25, 2) did not trigger when stepped on. Likely an arrival point or inactive.
- Observation: Tile (24, 2) appears safe from sensors (no encounter triggered while standing there).
- Plan: Traverse West through (24, 2) to bypass security and explore the rest of the floor.
- Observation: Room layout spans y=1 to y=5, divided by a wall at y=4 with a potential gap at (9, 4).
- Plan: Investigate the gap at (9, 4) to access the southern section.
Mechanic: Persian Statues (e.g., at 6,1) are security cameras. Walking in their line of sight triggers an alarm and infinite Rocket Grunt battles. Must find a **SECRET SWITCH** to disable them.
- Plan: Go South through gap at (9,4) to search for the switch in the unexplored area.
- Potentially Reachable Unseen Tiles (Turn 10466): (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (16, 7), (17, 7), (18, 7), (19, 7), (2, 8), (1, 7), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (7, 8), (14, 8), (15, 8), (20, 8), (21, 8), (22, 8), (23, 8), (24, 8), (25, 8), (26, 8), (27, 8), (28, 8).
- Plan: Investigate reachable tiles after battle.
- Checked (9, 6): No reaction. All statues in Row 6 (8-13) are cleared.
- Plan: Head East via Row 7 to avoid the camera at (24, 5) on Row 5.
- Goal: Reach the Item Ball at (27, 6) and explore the East side for the switch.
