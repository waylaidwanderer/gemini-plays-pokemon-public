# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement. Passable from SOUTH to NORTH. Found at (4, 20), (16, 10), (8, 34).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at (10, 15).
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- Start Turn: 49771
- Start Time: 3:29 PM

## Strategy: Western Corridor Land Route
The northern plateau (Row 10-15) is accessible via the Western Corridor (X=0-2).
1. Land at (19, 30) (Completed).
2. Walk to (9, 44) to bypass the X=11 wall.
3. Walk to (8, 35) to bypass the X=9 and X=5 walls.
4. Walk West to (2, 35) to enter the Western Corridor.
5. Walk North to (2, 10).
6. Walk East along Row 10 to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

## Hypotheses
- H1: The Western Corridor (X=0-2) is a continuous path from Row 44 to Row 10. (Partially verified by Mental Map up to Row 14).
- H2: (14, 10) is the trigger point for the Suicune sighting. (Marked in Mental Map).

# Progress Notes
- Verified: Row 15, X=0-2 is FLOOR.
- Verified: Row 35 is clear from X=8 to X=2.
- SUPER REPEL is active.
