## Strategy for Rising Badge (Gym Leader Clair)
- Status: Gym trainers defeated. Boulders pushed into pits.
- Opponent: Clair uses Dragon-type Pokemon (Dragonair, Kingdra).
- Strategy:
  - GNEISS (Lv48): Earthquake/Strength for high physical damage. (Dragonair is pure Dragon, vulnerable to Ground).
  - XENON (Lv36): Night Shade for fixed damage and Hypnosis for control (critical for Kingdra).
  - CALCIFER (Lv49): Thunderpunch (Electric) for coverage vs Kingdra (Water/Dragon) and Return for general damage.
  - KIMCHI (Lv33): Sleep Powder for secondary status control.

# Lessons Learned
- **Menu/Item Loop:** Direct verification via Stats/battle XP is more reliable than repeated menu navigation if cursor memory causes misclicks.
- **Ghost Immunity:** Haunter immune to Normal moves like Selfdestruct.
- **Gligar Typing:** Ground/Flying. Immune to Ground.
- **Gen 2 Haunter Weakness:** No Levitate. Vulnerable to Ground.
- **Menu Cursor Memory:** Menus like the Pack and Party remember the last cursor position. Verify the cursor location before executing long button sequences.
