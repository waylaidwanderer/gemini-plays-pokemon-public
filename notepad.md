# Current Strategy: Ascend Western Waterfall
- **Location:** Silver Cave Room 2 (3_75)
- **Status:** At the bottom lake (Row 31). Moving to (7, 30) to ascend the left waterfall.
- **Goal:** Reach Warp (11, 5) to access Southern Item Rooms.
- **Plan:**
  1. Move to (7, 30).
  2. Face UP and use Waterfall on (7, 29).
  3. Follow the river North to the warp at (11, 5).

# Key Findings
- **Item Rooms (3_77):**
  - **North Area:** Dead end / Exit loop.
  - **South Area:** Destination. Accessed via Room 2 Warp (11, 5).
- **Silver Cave Room 2 (3_75):**
  - **Waterfall:** Left side (x=7) leads to upper area. Right side (x=11) leads to exit loop.
  - **Warp (13, 21):** Exit loop return point.

# Tile Mechanics
- **WATERFALL:** Requires HM Waterfall. Face UP and press A.
- **Observation:** Verified x=6, 7, 8, 9 at Row 29 are "Currents" (they push the player back to Row 30).
- **Test:** Testing x=10.
- **Hypothesis:** x=11 is known to be the descent point. It is likely the ONLY ascent point.
- **Plan:**
  1. Test x=10.
  2. If x=10 fails, ascend x=11.
  3. **Crucial:** Once at the top (Row 27), Surf LEFT to reach the western channel. The water at the top connects!
- **Goal:** Reach Warp (11, 5).
