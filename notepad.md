# Mechanics
- **Battle Cursor:** Remembers last move used.
- **Fly Map:** Visual Map (Cursor based). Use D-pad to select city. **Cursor persists:** Verify destination text.
- **Pokegear Map:** Visual. Roaming Beasts appear as icon.
- **Menu Memory:** Start Menu and Pokegear cursors remember their last position. Always verify state.
- **Repel Safety:** Always re-apply Repel IMMEDIATELY upon expiration, even before short travel to avoid unwanted encounters.
- **Tile Mechanics:**
    - **Route 38 Gatehouse (35,8) & (35,9):** Sticky warps.
    - **Solution:** "Double Tap" technique (press direction into warp, then press again into wall) works reliably.
