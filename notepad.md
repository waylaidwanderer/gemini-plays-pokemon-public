# Suicune Capture Strategy
## The Repel Trick (Active)
- **Lead:** KIMCHI (Lv 21 Gloom).
- **Setup:** Super Repel active (Confirmed Turn #13509). Filters out wild Pokémon (Lv 13-16). Suicune (Lv 40) is the only possible encounter.
- **Pacing Area:** Route 38 tall grass (e.g., (26, 7)).
- **Roamer Logic:** Suicune moves routes ONLY when crossing map boundaries (e.g., Route 38/39 edge), using Fly, or after a battle.

## Battle Plan (vs Suicune Lv 40)
- **Strategy:**
  1. Chip damage and status are persistent across encounters.
  2. Use Sleep Powder (KIMCHI) immediately. Note: Suicune is faster (Base Speed 85 vs Gloom 40).
  3. Catching probability (Base HP, No Status, Great Ball): 0.39%.
  4. Contingency: Catch a faster trapper (e.g., Haunter for Mean Look) if progress stalls.

## Route 38 Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR:** Traversable. Standard ground.
- **WALL / HEADBUTT_TREE:** Impassable.
- **TALL_GRASS:** Traversable. Triggers wild encounters.
- **LEDGE_HOP (DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT):** One-way traversable (downwards/leftwards/rightwards). Confirmed by observation.
- **WARP_CARPET:** Traversable. Triggers map transition.
