# Suicune Quest (Crystal) - FIXED SIGHTINGS
- Milestone 1: Burned Tower (Seen).
- Milestone 2: Cianwood City (Seen). Defeated Eusine.
- Milestone 3: Route 42 (In Progress). Pokedex shows Suicune here.
- Milestone 4: Route 36 (Next).
- Milestone 5: Tin Tower (Final). Requirement: Clear Bell (OBTAINED) + all sightings.

## Strategy for Route 42 Sighting:
- Priority 1: Middle Island. Use Surf to reach the center area (X=24-30, Y=14-17).
- Note: Requires CUT to clear trees if approaching from specific angles.
- Priority 2: Western Pocket (Rows 1-2, X=7-11). Reachable via walking north from Mt. Mortar entrance at (10, 5).

# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Traversable with HM03 SURF.
- TALL_GRASS / LONG_GRASS: Traversable; triggers encounters.
- LEDGE: One-way traversable (usually South).
- WARP / DOOR / WARP_CARPET / CAVE: Map transition. Step triggers warp.
- FRUIT_TREE: Impassable; interact for fruit/apricorn.
- HEADBUTT_TREE: Impassable; interact with HM02 HEADBUTT.
- CUT_TREE: Impassable until cleared with HM01 CUT.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way wall; jumpable from North to South.

# Failed Hypotheses
- Suicune Sighting (Route 42): Island center sweep (X=24-30, Y=14-17) failed to trigger sighting multiple times (Turns 17968, 17985, 18002, 18021). Re-confirmed on Route 42 via Pokedex (Turn 18035).
- Hypothesis: Suicune is at the Apricorn trees (28, 16). Status: DENIED (Turn 17968).
- Hypothesis: Northern Plateau (Rows 0-2) is reachable via (48, 3). Status: DENIED (Turn 18061). (48, 3) is a dead end.

# Discoveries
- Suicune is NOT at the Apricorn trees (28, 16) as of Turn 17968.
