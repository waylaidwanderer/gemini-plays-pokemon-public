# PC Storage (Box 1)
- Ravioli (KRABBY): Lv10 (Surf, Whirlpool)
- LAPIS (POLIWAG): Lv12 (Waterfall, Surf, Whirlpool)

# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Standard walkable ground.
- WATER: Traversable only via Surf.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- WALL: Impassable obstacle.
- DOOR: Warp point.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Ledge face. Impassable from all directions.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).

# Suicune Capture Strategy
- Lead: XENON (Haunter, Lv44).
- Move 1: Hypnosis (Sleep). Accuracy is key.
- Move 2: Night Shade (44 dmg). Suicune (Lv40) has ~120 HP. Use twice for Red health.
- Move 3: Dream Eater (100 power). Only works if Suicune is asleep.
- Item: Ultra Balls (32).
- Backup: GORP (Snorlax) as a tank. Calcifer (Typhlosion) is risky due to type disadvantage.

# Strategic Plan: Southern Crossing
- Observation: The Great Spiral is a dead end. The North Plateau sighting spot (14, 10) is only reachable via the West Beach (X=2).
- Step 1: Use Super Repel. (In Progress)
- Step 2: Surf South to (27, 44) and land at (27, 45).
- Step 3: Walk West along Row 51. This is the only clear corridor to the West Beach.
- Step 4: Walk North along X=2 to Row 14.
- Step 5: Walk East to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.
- Status: XENON leading, Repel being used.

# Lessons Learned
- Pathing: The city center is a plateau, but Row 51 is a low-level corridor that connects the east and west coasts.
- Hallucination Correction: (11, 50) and (10, 50) are NOT blocked; they are FLOOR tiles that allow passage from the city center to Row 51.
- Turn 48170: At (26, 10). Starting Southern Crossing trek.
