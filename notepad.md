# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Active Strategy: The Great Southern Sea Loop (Final)
The city is a maze of one-way ledges. Row 51 is the only clear path to the Western Corridor (X=0-2), which leads to the northern plateau.

1. Surf South along column X=28 to Row 51. (In Progress)
2. Land at (24, 51).
3. Walk West along Row 51 to (2, 51).
4. Walk North through the Western Corridor (X=2) to Row 10.
5. Walk East along Row 10 to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

## Verified Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement (Confirmed at (10, 47) -> (10, 48)).
- Western Corridor: X=0-2 is a clear path from Row 51 to the northern plateau.
- Row 51: Clear horizontal passage across the southern edge of the city.
