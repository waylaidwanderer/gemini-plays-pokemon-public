## Strategy: Reaching Suicune Overworld Sighting
**Start Turn:** 48900 (Quest: Trigger Suicune Overworld Sighting)

Cianwood is a maze of vertical walls and one-way ledges. The most efficient path is via the Inner Channel, bypassing buoy walls at Row 10, 16, and 26.

### Step-by-Step Execution Plan
1. Walk to the Eastern Shore at (27, 44) and Surf. <- CURRENT TASK
2. Apply Super Repel and head North to Row 10.
3. Navigate buoy gaps: (26, 10) -> (22, 16) -> (18, 26) -> (16, 24).
4. Surf to (15, 16), then West to land at (13, 16).
5. Walk to the plateau: (13, 16) -> (11, 16) -> (11, 10) -> (14, 10).
6. Trigger Suicune sighting.

## Tile Mechanics: Cianwood City
- FLOOR: Standard traversable ground.
- WALL: Impassable barrier.
- WATER: Surf required.
- BUOY: Impassable water barrier.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way ledge. Blocks DOWN movement (Y to Y+1). Allows UP and East-West movement. (Verified at (6, 46)).

## Navigation: Buoy Gaps
- X=26 Wall: Gap at Row 10-15.
- X=22 Wall: Gap at Row 16-24.
- X=18 Wall: Gap at Row 26.
- X=16 Wall: Gap at Row 16-24.

## Inventory Check
- Super Repel: 5 remaining. Last applied turn 49278. (Re-apply after starting Surf).
- Party: Calcifer (Lv 64) leads. Ready for Eusine.
