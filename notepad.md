# Current Objectives
*   **Primary Goal:** Obtain the Boulder Badge from the Pewter City Gym Leader, Brock.
*   **Secondary Goal:** Acquire sufficient funds to heal FLAREE and purchase essential supplies.
*   **Tertiary Goal:** Reach Route 3 to identify trainers for battling.

# Game Mechanics & Strategy
*   **Ledge Mechanics:** One-way (downwards only). Cannot move UP onto a ledge from a lower Y.
*   **Movement Mechanic:** 1st press TURNS if not facing, 2nd press MOVES. **Pikachu Movement:** If not facing Pikachu and attempting to move onto Pikachu's tile, first press turns, second press moves. Applies only when moving *into* Pikachu's tile.
*   **Level Cap:** 0 badges = Lv12. EXP gain stops at cap.
*   **Data Trust:** Game State Information is absolute truth.
*   **Map Marker Usage:** ❗ (Event Trigger/Obstacle), 💁 (Event NPCs/blockers), ☠️ (Defeated Trainers), 📍 (Nav Point), 🏛️ (Building Entrance).

# Party Status (Turn 5490)
*   SPBARKY (PIKACHU): Lv12 (38/39 HP) (Level Cap Reached)
*   FLAREE (VULPIX): Lv8 (6/26 HP) - Critically low HP. Must be healed.
*   SPROUT (ODDISH): Lv12 (33/37 HP) (Level Cap Reached)

# Pewter City Navigation Challenge: Reaching Route 3 (East Exit)
*   **Current Location:** (12,19), facing Right. Pikachu at (11,19).
*   **Youngster (ID 5) Position:** Game State confirms Youngster is at (36,17). Previous critique about him being at (18,19) was incorrect.
*   **Youngster (ID 5) Escort Event (Info based on (36,17)):**
    *   NPC Location: (36,17).
    *   Behavior: Triggers an escort to the Gym entrance. Proximity, facing, and movement vector likely play a role. Event triggered when moving from (37,19) to (38,19) while Youngster was at (36,17).
    *   Marked potential trigger zones (worth caution): (36,17), (35,17), (30,19), (34,19), (36,18), (38,19), (38,20). (30,19) is also a drop-off point.
*   **Strategy to reach Route 3:**
    1.  Agent path to (30,19) failed. Current: (29,18) facing Left. New manual path to (30,19): (29,18) -> Right to (30,18) (Pikachu's tile) -> Up to (30,19).
    2.  Reached (30,16), then (34,16). Agent warned about (30,19) trigger if moving South from (30,16). Tile (35,16) is impassable. Reached (34,19) [TRIGGER].
    3.  Plan to move east from (34,19) along Y=19 to (40,19) (Route 3 exit). Will use `scripted_event_tracker_agent` from (34,19) before moving east.
    4.  Use `scripted_event_tracker_agent` when navigating the eastern part of the city (X > 25), especially near known trigger zones and the Youngster at (36,17).

# Agent Usage Plan
*   **`scripted_event_tracker_agent`:** Use for *every step* when near Youngster (ID 5) at (18,19). Input his current sprite coordinates as the main trigger point with a radius (e.g., r=3).
*   **`move_validator_agent`:** Use for short, complex pathing segments near known obstacles to avoid wasted turns.
*   **`exploration_planner_agent`**: Consider for complex pathing if manual attempts fail.
*   Other agents (route_progress, battle_log, potion_purchase) to be used when conditions are met.

# Inventory & Finances
*   POKé BALL x1
*   Money: ¥156 (Critically Low)

# Hindsight & Lessons Learned
*   **Pewter City West Pathing:** Manual pathing in western Pewter has been very inefficient. Agent-generated paths also failed due to leading into warps or hitting unexpected obstacles. Meticulous checking of map XML for impassable tiles or using `move_validator_agent` for short, complex segments is crucial.
*   **Youngster Event Dynamics:** The trigger is NOT solely fixed tiles. His *current location* is paramount. The escort seems to happen when player is on certain tiles and Youngster is at specific nearby coordinates, possibly involving line of sight or approach vector. My understanding of his trigger mechanism requires a complete overhaul.
*   **Notepad Updates:** Need to be more precise with `old_text` for `replace` actions.
*   **Critique Reliance:** While critiques are helpful, I must always prioritize and verify Game State Information. The critique stating Youngster was at (18,19) in turn 5489 was correct, and I mistakenly trusted my older memory over checking the *current* Game State. I will ensure to always check current Game State for NPC positions before finalizing plans.
