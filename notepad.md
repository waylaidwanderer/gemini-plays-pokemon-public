# I. Game Mechanics & World Rules

## A. Tile Mechanics & Traversal
- **Ground:** Standard walkable tile.
- **Grass:** Walkable tile where wild Pokémon can be encountered.
- **Water:** Can be crossed using the SURF HM.
- **Impassable:** Walls, trees, and other objects that block movement.
- **Elevated Ground:** Walkable ground at a different elevation. Cannot use Surf from this tile type.
- **Gate (`gate_offscreen`, `closed_gate`, `open_gate`):** Barriers that may open or close.
- **Boulder Switch:** A floor switch activated by a boulder. Is a traversable tile.
- **Boulder Barrier:** An impassable barrier that becomes a `cleared_boulder_barrier` tile when the corresponding switch is activated.
- **Cleared Boulder Barrier:** A traversable ground tile that appears after a boulder puzzle is solved. It allows movement between different elevations, acting like a ramp.
- **Steps:** Allows vertical movement between `ground` and `elevated_ground` tiles.
- **Ladders (`ladder_up`, `ladder_down`):** Function as instant 1x1 warps between floors. `ladder_up` leads to a higher floor, `ladder_down` leads to a lower floor.
- **Hole:** A tile that functions as a warp, dropping the player to a lower floor. Boulders can be pushed into these to affect puzzles on the floor below.
- **Spinner (`spinner_up`, `spinner_down`, `spinner_left`, `spinner_right`):** Forces movement in the specified direction.

## B. General Rules & Heuristics
- **PC Interaction:** To use a PC, stand directly below it, face up, and press 'A'.
- **HM Usage:** HMs are used from the party menu. Fainted Pokémon can use field moves.
- **"No Will to Fight" Message (Correction):** Appears when the party menu cursor is on a fainted Pokémon.
- **Level Cap:** The level cap with 8 badges is 65.
- **Special NPC Interaction:** Certain puzzles may require walking *through* an NPC rather than interacting with them (e.g., Summer Beach House).
- **Boulder Puzzle Mechanics:** Boulders cannot be pushed directly into standard `water` tiles. They must be pushed into `hole` tiles to affect lower floors.
- **Pushing Boulders (Movement Anomaly):** Pushing a boulder does not always move the player character into the boulder's previous position. The player's position must be verified after every push.
- **PC Tile Anomaly:** The tile for interacting with the Pokémon Center PC is sometimes labeled as `grass` in the map data, despite being indoors.

## A. Type Effectiveness Chart (Verified)
- **Super Effective (2x):** Psychic > Ghost, Poison; Ghost > Psychic; Electric > Rock, Water; Flying > Grass, Poison, Fighting; Ice > Ground, Grass, Flying, Dragon; Ground > Poison, Fire, Electric, Rock; Rock > Fire, Ice, Flying, Bug; Fighting > Normal, Rock, Ice; Water > Fire, Ground, Rock; Grass > Water, Ground, Rock; Bug > Grass, Poison, Psychic; Poison > Grass, Bug.

# III. Active Plans & Puzzles

## Victory Road 1F Puzzle
- **Objective:** Push the boulder from (6, 16) to its corresponding switch.
- **Current Boulder Location:** (6, 16)
- **Switch Location:** Unknown.
- **Status:** In progress. The area needs to be explored to find the switch.

# IV. Tool Development & Maintenance

## A. Future Ideas
- **`puzzle_deadlock_analyzer` Agent Idea:** Create an agent that analyzes situations where progress is stalled despite an apparent solution (e.g., a puzzle is solved but the path remains blocked). The agent would take the context and suggest a ranked list of hypotheses to test, such as 'map state update lag (test with local movement)', 'map state bug (test by leaving and re-entering map)', or 'hidden secondary mechanic (test with exhaustive interaction)'. This would help structure my problem-solving when I get stuck.

# V. Core Gameplay Lessons
- **Immediate Tool Refinement:** Deferring fixes for critical tools like the pathfinder is a major strategic error. Faulty tools must be addressed immediately, as they are foundational to efficient gameplay. I wasted significant time manually pathing and retrying because I didn't fix the tool right away.
- **Archived Puzzle Solutions:** Puzzles can reset upon re-entering a map. Archived solutions may be outdated. Always observe the current state of a puzzle before acting on old information.
