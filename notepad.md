# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Location:** Route 28 (West End).
- **Status:** Battling Wild Rapidash (Turn 25362).
- **Action:** Press A to confirm USE of Ultra Ball.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Current screen explicitly shows the Bag Menu with Ultra Ball -> USE selected.
  2. Pressing A will throw the ball.
  3. Ignoring the confusion about how I got here from the text screen in one turn; the screen state is the source of truth.
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Catch Rapidash.
  2. After battle, delete erroneous map marker at (31, 3) and explore West end.

# Reflection (Turn 25341)
- **Status:** Battling Wild Ponyta on Route 28.
- **Hygiene:** Notepad updated. Map markers to be updated post-battle (failed hidden path).
- **Goals:** Catch Ponyta, then explore West Route 28.
- **Strategy:** Using Ultra Balls at full health due to level difference risk.
- **Tools:** `select_battle_option` being used. `find_path` ready for post-battle.
