# Suicune Quest
- Objective: Trigger sighting in Cianwood City at northern shore.
- Strategy: The Sea Loop (Surfing Route)
    1. From (27, 6), go South to (27, 10).
    2. Go West to (23, 10).
    3. Go North to (23, 8).
    4. Go West through the gap at (22, 8) to (7, 8).
    5. Go North to (7, 4) area.
- Note: The gap at (22, 8) is the key to bypassing the buoy walls. The land route via Row 51 is a backup.
- Suicune sighting count = 1.

# Tile Mechanics (Cianwood)
- FLOOR: Standard walkable ground.
- WATER: Traversable only while Surfing.
- WALL / FLOOR_UP_WALL / LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: All act as IMPASSABLE obstacles from the north.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- Interaction: Surf from FLOOR adjacent to WATER by pressing A.

# Confirmed Corridors
- X=19: Clear from Row 30 to Row 51.
- Row 51: Clear from X=4 to X=23.
- X=4: Clear from Row 44 to Row 51.
- Row 44: Clear from X=2 to X=23.
- X=2: Clear from Row 4 to Row 49.

# Lessons Learned
- Cianwood ledges are impassable from the north. Do not attempt to jump them.
- Internal walls divide the city into vertical strips; use Row 51 to move between them.
- Always reveal tiles manually before planning long-distance routes.
