### Quest Log
- **Badges**: Zephyr, Hive, Plain.
- **Party**: All Healthy.
- **Mail Quest**: Active.
- **Contest**: Not entered (lack of Sport Balls/Bug Catching logic).

### Strategic Notes
- **SquirtBottle**: Need to talk to Floria to progress.
- **Current Location**: Route 36 / National Park East (Map 10_3).
- **Goal**: Find Floria.
- **Correction**: The "gate" at (21, 7) is a sign/obstacle. The real gatehouse entrance is at (17, 8) (Red Carpet).
- **New Lead**: A sprite appeared at (21, 4). Investigating if this is Floria.
- **Plan**: Talk to sprite at (21, 4). If not Floria, enter Gatehouse at (17, 8).
