# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Active Strategy: House-to-House Search for Rock Smash
The northern plateau (14, 10) is blocked by rocks. I need TM08 Rock Smash to proceed. Advisor says the NPC is typically outside, but I will check all buildings systematically to be sure.

2. X=2 Corridor: Potential bypass via Row 51 and X=2. (Unconfirmed northern exit).
3. Photo Studio (9, 31): Next if X=2 is blocked.
4. Pharmacy (15, 47): Next.
5. Pokefan F (10, 46): Outside.
6. Pokefan M (17, 33): Outside. Mentioned Rock Smash.
7. Lugia Speech House (15, 37).
