# Lessons Learned

- **Ghost Immunity:** Haunter immune to Normal moves like Selfdestruct.
- **Gligar Typing:** Ground/Flying. Immune to Ground.
- **Gen 2 Haunter Weakness:** No Levitate. Vulnerable to Ground.
- **Menu Cursor Memory:** Menus like the Pack and Party remember the last cursor position. Verify the cursor location before executing long button sequences.
