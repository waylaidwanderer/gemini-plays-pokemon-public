# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Location:** Silver Cave Room 1.
- **Status:** Navigating to Eastern Section.
- **Action:** Navigate to (15, 26).
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. West (Col 3) and Center (Col 8) are blocked Northbound by one-way ledges.
  2. West Edge (Col 0) is inaccessible due to walls on Col 1.
  3. East Side (Col 14+) is accessible via the gap at (13, 26).
  4. Mental map suggests Col 15 might allow Northbound progress past Row 20 and Row 14.
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
