# Suicune Capture Strategy
## The Repel Trick
- Lead: KIMCHI (Lv 21 Gloom).
- Method: Super Repel filters wild Pokemon (Lv 13-16). Suicune (Lv 40) is the only possible encounter.
- Status: Repel NOT active (Confirmed by Meowth encounter at Turn #13583).
- Inventory: Super Repel x6 (Item 15 in PACK).
- Confirmed PACK Order:
  1. PSNCUREBERRY, 2. X ATTACK, 3. BITTER BERRY, 4. ICE BERRY, 5. MAX ETHER, 6. FULL HEAL, 7. ICE HEAL, 8. X SPECIAL, 9. GUARD SPEC., 10. LEMONADE, 11. FRESH WATER, 12. SUPER POTION, 13. AMULET COIN, 14. REVIVE, 15. SUPER REPEL

## Battle Strategy
- Target: Suicune (Lv 40, Base Speed 85).
- Lead: KIMCHI (Lv 21, Base Speed 40).
- Mechanics: Suicune flees on Turn 1. It outspeeds Gloom.
- Plan: Inflict Sleep (Sleep Powder) to prevent fleeing in subsequent encounters. HP and status are persistent.
- Catch Rate: ~0.39% (Full HP, No Status, Great Ball). Increases to ~4.3% if asleep.
- Contingency: If progress stalls, catch a faster Pokémon with Sleep/Mean Look (e.g. Haunter/Golbat).

## Route 38 Environment
- Roamer Logic: Suicune moves routes ONLY when crossing map boundaries (Route 38/39 edge), using Fly, or after a battle.
- Boundary: Route 38 (0, 10) <-> Route 39 (19, 10).
- Location: Verified on Route 38 (Turn #13572).
