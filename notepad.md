# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- **Quest Start:** Turn 48900

## Execution Plan (Southern Bypass)
1. Walk to (23, 32) and use Surf. <- CURRENT TASK
2. Surf South to Row 52, then West to (2, 52).
3. Land at (2, 51) and walk North to (2, 14).
4. Walk East to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

## Strategy: Southern Bypass
Terrestrial paths to the western corridor are blocked by multiple ledge lines (Row 34, 46, 48, 50). The only way to reach the plateau is to Surf around the south end of the map. This avoids all city barriers.

## Tile Mechanics (Cianwood)
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL**: One-way ledge. Blocks South movement. (Verified at Row 34, 46, 48, 50).
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN**: One-way ledge. Blocks North movement.

## Failed Hypotheses & Lessons
- Terrestrial Center Path: Blocked by upward ledges at Row 34.
- Inner Channel (X=12): Blocked at Row 15 by buoy wall.
- Island Hop (13, 16): Dead end pocket at (11, 14).

## Progress Summary
- All 16 Badges obtained.
- Current Focus: Suicune tracking.
