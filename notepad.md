- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Current Objectives
1. **Find Floria**: Located at Route 36 (North of Route 35).
2. **Get SquirtBottle**: Return to Flower Shop (19, 1) after finding Floria.
3. **Clear Sudowoodo**: Use SquirtBottle on Route 36.

### Navigation Strategy: Goldenrod City
- **Route 35 Exit**: Located at the North Map Edge (y=0) around x=16 and x=24.
- **Access**: The corridors leading North are separated by buildings.
  - **x=19 Corridor**: Dead End (Flower Shop). Must loop South to Row 8 to exit.
  - **x=16 Corridor**: Connects to Exit. Enter from Row 8.
  - **x=24 Corridor**: Connects to Exit.

### Validated Locations
- **Flower Shop**: (19, 1).
- **Underground Entrance**: (9, 5).
- **Radio Tower**: (5, 15).
- **Gym**: (24, 7).

### Quest Log
- **Badges**: Zephyr, Hive, Plain.
- **Party**: Quilava (27), Bellsprout (6), Togepi (5), Rattata (8), Igglybuff (5).
- **West Narrow Path**: Explored (x=3, y=15). Dead end to the North.
- **Correction**: The East side and Center are dead ends. The Underground path leads South (wrong way).
- **Hypothesis**: The Train Tracks at the far West (x=0-1) might offer a path North.
- **West Side Access**: The path at x=8 is blocked at y=24 by a fence. A continuous vertical barrier (wall/ledge/fence) exists at x=9, separating East and West sides.
- **West Side Access**: The path at x=8 is blocked. The South area (Gatehouse) does not connect to the West side.
- **Plan**: Return to Goldenrod City, then head North to Route 36 to find Floria and the Sudowoodo.
- **Tracks**: Possible path North along the tracks?
