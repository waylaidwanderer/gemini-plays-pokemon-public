### Strategic Reflection (Turn 8719)
- **Status**: Stuck in Goldenrod for ~100 turns.
- **Issue**: Oscillating between East/West without clearing the "fog of war".
- **Insight**: The North-East (Flower Shop) is a cul-de-sac. The Central North Wall seems solid. The only remaining option is the North-West quadrant, which is largely "unseen".
- **Action Plan**: 
    1. Return to Main Street (y=10).
    2. Move West to x=6.
    3.Systematically explore North from there, hugging the West edge.

### Navigation Notes
- **Location**: Goldenrod City (Tracks Crossing).
- **Goal**: Reach North-West Quadrant.
- **Status**: Moving North to cross tracks.
- **Plan**: 
    1. Move to (18, 10) to cross tracks.
    2. Move West to (6, 8).
    3. Verify "Wall" at (5, 8).
    4. If no gap, enter Game Corner (9, 5) to check for a path.

### Quest Chain: SquirtBottle
1. **Defeat Whitney**: Done (Plain Badge obtained).
2. **Find Floria**: Currently seeking at Route 36.
3. **Get Bottle**: Return to Flower Shop after meeting Floria.

### Key Locations
- **Game Corner**: (9, 5).
- **Target**: (6, 8).
