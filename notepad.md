# Hall of Fame Entry
- **Achievement:** **CHAMPION OF THE JOHTO LEAGUE!**
- **Date:** Turn 33314
- **MVP:** Muscle (Machoke) Lv88.

# Reflection (Turn 34888)
- **Execution:** Fly Map navigation has failed for 10+ turns. Horizontal inputs (Left/Right from Ecruteak) are being ignored or dropped. Vertical (Down to Goldenrod) works.
- **Hygiene:** Notepad is clean. Map markers are good.
- **Strategy:** Hard reset required. Closing Fly Map to reset cursor state.
- **Hypothesis:** Rapid inputs or specific axis transitions are bugged/laggy. Will retry with single, verified inputs after reset.
- **Contingency:** If Fly continues to fail, I will walk to Olivine via Route 38 (West Gate).
