- **Tertiary:** Train team.

# Current Status

- **Party:** Healthy. Muscle (Lv61) leading.
- **Inventory:** 6 Hyper Potions, 10 Revives, 2 Full Restores.
- **Money:** Low (¥589).

# Exploration Log
- **Victory Road:** Fully traversed.
- **Indigo Plateau:** Lobby explored. Shopping done.

# Plan
1.  **Battle:** Talk to Will and win.
    - **Strategy:** Muscle (Lv61) spams Strength.
    - **Reasoning:** Strength (Normal) is neutral vs all his dual-Psychic types (Flying, Ice, Grass, Water). Cross Chop (Fighting) is resisted by Psychic and Flying, making it poor vs Xatu, Exeggutor, Slowbro.
    - **Matchup:** Muscle outlevels by ~20 levels. Expect OHKOs.
2.  **Next:** Advance to Koga's room.
- **Battle Update:** Xatu survived first Strength (~45% HP remaining). Confuse Ray is problematic.
- **Action:** Using Full Restore to heal HP and cure Confusion. Priority is keeping Muscle healthy and active.
- **Turn 19091:** Previous attempt to use Full Restore was partially blocked (mixed inputs). Cursor is now on Full Restore. Confirming usage on Muscle.
- **Turn 19094:** Full Restore successful. Muscle at 100% HP and cured.
- **Next:** Opponent's turn (Xatu will attack). Then Muscle attacks with Strength.
- **Turn 19095:** Full Restore healed Muscle to max, but Xatu used Psychic (Crit or High Roll? ~80 dmg). Muscle HP 120/201.
- **Next:** Muscle outspeeds. Strength to finish Xatu.
