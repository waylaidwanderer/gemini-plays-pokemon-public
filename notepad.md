# Active Strategy: The Suicune Pursuit
- **Immediate Goal:** Trigger Suicune sighting at (14, 10) in northern Cianwood.
- **Battle Prep:** Lead with Lv64 Calcifer to sweep Eusine's team (Drowzee, Haunter, Electrode).
- **Plan (The Southern Bypass):**
  1. Land at (27, 45).
  2. Walk West to (18, 45) and South through the gap at (18, 46).
  3. Walk South to (18, 50), West to (7, 50), and South through the gap at (7, 51).
  4. Walk West on Row 51 to (2, 51).
  5. Walk North via X=2 corridor to (2, 10) (Clear of all one-way barriers).
  6. Walk East to (14, 10) for the sighting.
- **Contingency:** If X=2 is blocked, use Surf to (15, 10) from the northern bay (requires finding a buoy gap at Row 5).

# Progress Tracking
- **Sighting Start:** Turn #50620.
- **Acquired:** Rock Smash (GNEISS).
- **Smashed Rocks:** (5, 29), (4, 25), (8, 16), (9, 17). Verified as FLOOR.

# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard traversable terrain.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable terrain.
- WATER: Traversable only with Surf.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump DOWN (South). Blocks North.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL (Terrace Climb): One-way jump UP (North). Blocks South.
- ROCK (Object): Blocks movement; cleared with Rock Smash.

# Area Notes: Cianwood City
- **Dead Ends:** (11, 15) is a pocket blocked by WALL at (11, 13) and (12, 14).
- **Barrier:** Row 46-50 is a wall of cliffs. Gaps at (18, 46) and (7, 51).
- **Navigation:** X=2 and X=4 are the only corridors reaching Row 10 from the south. X=4 is blocked by a wall at (4, 23). X=2 is clear.
