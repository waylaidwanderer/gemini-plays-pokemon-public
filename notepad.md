# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Stop Team Rocket.
- **Secondary Goal:** Investigate Radio Tower (Team Rocket takeover).
- **Navigation:** Flying to Goldenrod City.
- **Status:** In Flight / Arriving in Goldenrod.
- **Reason:** Executed Fly sequence. Heading to PokeCenter to swap Pokemon.
- **Plan:**
    1. Arrive in Goldenrod City.
    2. Enter PokeCenter (15, 27).
    3. Deposit Togepi / Withdraw Gyarados.

# Reflection (Turn 11689)
- **Execution:** Fly attempt failed (landed back in New Bark Town). Likely map navigation error or input drop.
- **Lesson:** Verify Fly destination text BEFORE pressing A. Do not batch navigation and confirmation in one turn.
- **Hygiene:** Map markers for PC types (Storage vs Research) helped avoid confusion at Elm's Lab.
- **Strategy:** Pivot to step-by-step Fly navigation.

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Stop Team Rocket.
- **Secondary Goal:** Investigate Radio Tower (Team Rocket takeover).
- **Navigation:** Flying to Goldenrod City.
- **Status:** Emergency Reset (Exit all menus).
- **Reason:** Map inputs failing consistently. Suspect incorrect menu state (e.g., Pokegear map vs Fly map). Resetting to Overworld to guarantee clean entry.
- **Plan:**
    1. Press B x5 to close everything.
    2. Verify Overworld (No text/overlays).
    3. Next Turn: Open Menu -> Pokemon -> Mistral -> Fly.
