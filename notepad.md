# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Cross the whirlpool to reach the Dragon Shrine.

# Key Mechanics & Lessons
- **Field Moves:** If 'A' interaction fails (even when facing correctly), ALWAYS fallback to Menu -> Pokemon -> [Mon] -> [Move].
- **Whirlpool:** Requires facing the whirlpool tile directly. 'A' button might be unreliable; Menu is safer.

- Status: Correcting Facing for Whirlpool (Retry).
- Reason: Previous attempt failed (still facing UP). Menu is confirmed OPEN.
- Plan: Use 'Start' to Close Menu (toggles it off), then 'Down' to Face Down, then 'Start' to Re-open Menu.
- Sequence: Start -> Down -> Start.
- Tool: slow_press with 2000ms delay to ensure state transitions complete.
