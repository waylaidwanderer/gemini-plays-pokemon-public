# Current Strategy: Defeat Red
- **Start Turn:** 26779 (Jan 7, 2026)
- **Location:** Silver Cave Room 3 (3_76)
- **Status:** In Battle with Red.
- **Active Matchup:** Muscle (Lv 83, 44/280 HP) vs Espeon (Lv 73).
- **Goal:** Defeat Red.
- **Battle Plan:**
  - **TACTIC: PP STALL.**
    - Espeon's Psychic deals ~236 dmg (84%). It's a 2HKO.
    - Muscle survives 1 hit.
    - Espeon has ~10 PP for Psychic.
    - I have 15 Full Restores.
    - **Action:** Use Full Restore on Muscle every turn until Espeon stops using Psychic.
    - **Risk:** Sp. Def drop from Psychic (10% chance) or Crit (6.25%). If that happens, I might need to sacrifice fodder to revive/reset.
  - **After Stall:** Once Psychic is dry, Espeon will likely use Swift. Muscle can tank that easily. Then kill with Strength.
- **Items:** 15 Full Restores, 19 Revives.

# Key Findings
- **Silver Cave:** Room 2 Warp (11, 5) led directly to Room 3 (Red's Chamber), not Item Rooms.
