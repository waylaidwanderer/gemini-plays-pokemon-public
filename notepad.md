  1. Mechanic Test: Walk onto Row 34 terrace at (8, 34) from (8, 35). Try moving West to (7, 34).
  2. If horizontal movement works: Walk West to (5, 34), then North to (5, 12).
  3. If not: Walk to (12, 28) and use SURF to reach the northern section.
  4. Navigate to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune sighting.
