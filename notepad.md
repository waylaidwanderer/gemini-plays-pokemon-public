### Lessons Learned
- Gengar (Ghost): Immune to Normal moves (Return).
- Dragonite (Ghost interaction): XENON is immune to Hyper Beam (Normal).
- Party Sub-menu Order (Battle): SWITCH, STATS, CANCEL.

## Battle with Lance (Cont.)
- Progress: 3/6 defeated.
- Current: Ouroboros vs Charizard. XENON fainted.
- Plan: Use Ouroboros as fodder to safely Revive XENON. GNEISS is the primary counter to Charizard but needs more HP or a Revive if it faints.
- Turn 37542: Misclicked Berry instead of Revive. Backing out to find Revive in the item list.
- Turn 37544: Cursor on BERRY. Scrolling down to find REVIVE to use on XENON.
- Resource Check: Only Berries and Revives left. Revives will be used as 50% HP heals for fainted members.
