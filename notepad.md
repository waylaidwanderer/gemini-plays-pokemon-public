## Tracking Progress and Corrections
### Current Plan
- **Objective:** Reach Cherrygrove City.
- **Strategy:**
    1. The route has an upper and lower path. The lower path led to a dead end.
    2. I need to find the fork that leads to the upper path. I am currently at (39, 15).
    3. The upper path seems to be north of my current position. I will explore north to find it.
    4. Once on the upper path, I will proceed west towards the city entrance at (0, 9).
