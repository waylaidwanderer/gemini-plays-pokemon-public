4. Walk North to (10, 44), then West to (8, 44) (Gap in X=9 wall).
5. Walk South to (8, 48), then West to (6, 48) (Gap in X=7 wall).
6. Walk North to (6, 35), then West to (2, 35) (Gap in X=5 wall).
7. Walk North along the West Beach Highway (X=2) to (2, 14).
8. Walk East along Row 14 to (8, 14).
9. Walk North to (8, 10), then East to (14, 10).
