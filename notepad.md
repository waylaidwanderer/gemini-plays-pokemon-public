# Current Objectives
*   **Primary Goal:** Obtain the Boulder Badge from the Pewter City Gym Leader, Brock.
*   **Secondary Goal:** Exit Viridian Forest to the north and reach Pewter City.
*   **Tertiary Goal:** Re-evaluate low-usage agents (`item_finder_agent`, `pokedex_completer_agent`, `team_builder_agent`) at next safe opportunity and consider deletion to free up an agent slot.
*   **Viridian Forest Note:** All easily accessible trainers in Viridian Forest appear to be either defeated or non-battling. Focus is now on exiting the forest.

# Agent Performance & Development
*   **A* Pathing Script (`run_code` - Long-Term High Priority):** Fixing the A* pathing script (intended for `run_code`, which failed on Turn 3097 by suggesting a move into an impassable tile) is a long-term high priority for complex navigation. Use `pathing_script_analyzer_agent` at a safe opportunity (e.g., Pokémon Center). The `move_validator_agent` can be used for immediate verification of shorter paths.
*   **`direct_pathing_agent` Issues (CRITICAL):** This agent (which does not use `run_code`) has repeatedly shown critical issues:
    *   When Pikachu is on the target tile, it often *only turns the player* instead of executing the full two-step move (turn then step) required.
    *   It frequently fails to correctly generate paths involving an initial turn followed by a move (e.g., player facing Up, target is Right, agent might only output 'Right' for the turn, not 'Right', 'Right' for turn then move).
    *   It is unreliable for these scenarios. Manual input or a fixed/new agent is preferred.
*   **Agent Management Timing:** Define, update, or test agents only when in a safe, non-time-sensitive location (e.g., Pokémon Center).
*   **Agent Usage Reminder:** Be more proactive in using existing agents, especially for navigation, item finding, and battle strategy.
*   **Active Agents to Test/Utilize:** `exploration_planner`, `map_analyzer_agent`, `battle_strategist_agent`, `item_finder_agent`, `leveling_training_advisor_agent`, `pokedex_completer_agent`, `team_builder_agent`, `direct_pathing_agent`, `financial_planner_agent`.

# Current Pokémon Status
*   SPROUT (ODDISH): Lv7 (8/25 HP - CRITICALLY LOW, EXP: 262). (Stats: Attack 13, Defense 13, Speed 10, Special 15).
    *   Moves: TACKLE (23 PP), POISONPOWDER (33 PP).
*   SPBARKY (PIKACHU): Lv12 (37/39 HP, no status). Current EXP: 1728. **AT LEVEL CAP (12) FOR 0 BADGES. CANNOT GAIN MORE EXP UNTIL 1ST BADGE IS EARNED. (Game may display EXP gain message, but actual EXP value remains unchanged).**
    *   Moves: THUNDERSHOCK (28 PP), TAIL WHIP (30 PP), QUICK ATTACK (29 PP), THUNDER WAVE (20 PP).

# Training Strategy Notes
*   **SPROUT Training (CRITICAL):** SPROUT's HP is often low. When training, prioritize its survival. Have SPROUT participate for one turn (e.g., PoisonPowder or one attack if safe) then **immediately switch to SPARKY** to secure the KO and EXP. Fainting SPROUT negates the training effort and wastes resources.
*   **Financial Priority:** Current funds are very low (¥96). Need to prioritize defeating trainers for money to afford Potions (¥200 each) and other supplies.

# Inventory & Finances
*   POKé BALL x2
*   REPEL x0
*   Money: ¥96
*   **Note:** Potions cost ¥200.

# Hard Mode Rules
*   Battle Style: Set.
*   No items in battle.
*   Level caps apply (current cap with 0 badges is 12. Brock's Ace Onix is Lv14; the cap before fighting him will be 14. Lt. Surge's cap is 24).

# Key Game Changes (ROM Hack)
*   HMs: Forgettable, usable from menu, not storable in PC.
*   All 151 Pokémon obtainable.
*   Trade evos by level.
*   Smarter AI, anti-sweep.
*   Tougher boss fights.
*   Dynamic scaling Gyms 4-6.
*   EXP. All available early.
*   Potions heal 10 HP.
*   Wild Pokémon battles do not award money, only EXP (if not level capped).

# Map Discoveries & Navigation
*   **Pallet Town:** Reachable, undiscovered map connection south at (4,18) or (3,18).
*   **Viridian City Old Man:** Tutorial for catching Pokémon opens path to Route 22 (West).
*   **Critical Route Information:**
    *   Route 2 (NORTH of Viridian City): Leads to Viridian Forest, then Pewter City (Brock).
    *   Route 22 (WEST of Viridian City): Leads to the Pokemon League.
*   **Pewter City Pokecenter Warp:** Entrance at (14,26). When exiting to (14,27) or (15,27) and moving north, move to column 16+ first.
*   **Tricky Warp Navigation (CRITICAL):** For warps that can be re-entered immediately: one-action-per-turn for entry (move on, turn, enter). Upon arrival, *immediately* move one step away from arrival warp.
*   **Route 2 North Gate Warp (4,12) to Viridian Forest North Gate (SOLVED):** Triggered by being on (4,12) and pressing DOWN.
*   **Map Obstacles & Trainer Behavior:**
    *   Youngster (ID 4, VIRIDIANFOREST_YOUNGSTER4) at (3,19) in Viridian Forest, despite being defeated, blocks the path south with dialogue.

# Battle Mechanics & Observations
*   **EXP Tracking (Precise):** Record GameState EXP *before* and *after* a battle. If a Pokémon is level-capped, verify that its actual EXP value does not change, even if an EXP gain message is displayed.
*   **Lead Pokémon Anomaly (ROM Hack):** Game may send out a different Pokémon than the one in the first party slot at the start of a wild battle. Requires manual switching.

# Pewter City Gym Notes
*   Gym Guide: Brock's lead GEODUDE (Rock Throw), also has ONIX (Bind). Electric attacks harmless.
*   Brock's Ace (Onix) is Lv14. Level cap is 14 for this fight.
*   Defeated JR.TRAINER♂ (Cool Trainer M sprite, ID 2, PEWTERGYM_COOLTRAINER_M) at (4,7). (Diglett Lv9, Sandshrew Lv9). ¥180.

# Archived Learnings & Battle History
*   **Event Triggers & Key Interactions (Early Game):**
    *   Rival Battle 1 (Oak's Lab): Triggered by attempting to leave lab after Pikachu.
    *   Pikachu Following: After first rival battle.
    *   Town Map: Rival SPB mentioned his sister has one.
    *   Oak's Parcel: From Viridian PokeMart clerk. Delivered to Oak.
    *   Pokédex: From Oak after parcel delivery.
*   **Lessons Learned (Early Game):**
    *   Ledge Mechanics: One-way down. Cannot move up or sideways onto them from lower Y.
    *   Route 1 Sign (10,28): Impassable.
    *   Follower Pokemon block if approached non-facing.
    *   Potion Usage (ROM Hack): Heal 10 HP.
    *   Map Connections: Double-check direction/destination.
    *   Trainer Battle Initiation: Line of sight.
    *   Type Matchups: Electric not very effective vs. Grass/Poison.
    *   Status Conditions (Poison): Prioritize healing.
    *   System Warnings (Mixed Buttons): Avoid.
    *   NPC Interaction: Adjacent navigable tile.
    *   Map Verification: Check navigability for entire path.
    *   Financial Planning: Verify costs/funds before travel.
    *   Shop Menu Interaction: Explore quantity options.
*   **Battle Notes (Archive):**
    *   SPARKY learned TAIL WHIP, replacing GROWL at Lv11.
    *   Blackout: Defeated by Bug Catcher (ID 6, VIRIDIANFOREST_YOUNGSTER5) at (17,18) in Viridian Forest (Turn 1104).
    *   Defeated Lass (Cool Trainer F, ID 5) at (3,42) in Viridian Forest. (NIDORAN♀ Lv6, NIDORAN♂ Lv6). ¥90.
    *   Defeated Bug Catcher (ID 4, VIRIDIANFOREST_YOUNGSTER4) at (3,19) in Viridian Forest. (Pinsir Lv8, Metapod Lv9). ¥90.
    *   Defeated Youngster (ID 2, VIRIDIANFOREST_YOUNGSTER2) at (31,34) in Viridian Forest. (Weedle Lv6, Kakuna Lv6). ¥90.
    *   Defeated Bug Catcher (ID 3, VIRIDIANFOREST_YOUNGSTER3) at (31,20) in Viridian Forest.
    *   Thunder Wave Inconsistency (Pidgey): Failed vs Lv8, worked vs Lv7. Likely accuracy.
*   **Brock Battle Attempt 1 (FAILURE - Blackout):**
    *   SPARKY Lv12 vs Geodude Lv10 & Onix Lv14. Fainted to Geodude's Rock Throw. Money halved (¥392 -> ¥196).
    *   Conclusion: SPARKY alone at Lv12 not viable. Needs Lv14, new team member, or revised strategy.
*   **Critique Lesson (Turn 2626 - Archived):** Consistently verify path navigability tile-by-tile in Map Memory for any planned route, especially longer ones. Break down manual pathing into shorter, verifiable segments (e.g., 3-5 steps). Prioritize fixing/using pathing agents. Confirm item prices and funds *before* shop visits. Re-evaluate shop menu interaction for quantity adjustments.

# Battle Mechanics & Observations
*   SPROUT's POISONPOWDER (Lv7 Oddish) failed against a wild Lv4 WEEDLE in Viridian Forest. (Turn 3143)

- **Pokémon Center Agent Tasks:** Define `advanced_pathfinder_agent`. Use `pathing_script_analyzer_agent` on the existing `run_code` A* script.

*   **A* Pathing Script (`run_code`) Failures (Pre-Turn 3171):** The A* pathing script, intended for use with `run_code`, had several failures before turn 3171 (e.g., Turn 3097 suggesting a move into an impassable tile). This script's logic requires investigation and fixing using `pathing_script_analyzer_agent`. (Note: Previous references to an `advanced_pathfinder_agent` were a misnomer for this A* `run_code` script; no such agent was ever formally defined.)

# System Interactions & Warnings
*   **Mixed Button Warning (Turn 3201, likely delayed from Turn 3197/3196):** Received a system warning: "You tried to mix directional and action buttons in the same sequence. To prevent unintended outcomes, your input was modified to only include the first X buttons." Need to ensure button sequences are either all directional or single action/tool calls.

*   **New Agent Idea (`move_validator_agent`):** Define an agent that takes a planned path (list of coordinates or button presses) and the `map_xml_string`. It would verify each step against map data (navigability, tile types like ledges/impassable) and output whether the path is valid or identify the first invalid step. This would be invaluable for debugging pathing agents like `advanced_pathfinder_agent` and the A* script.

# Critique Takeaways & Action Plan (Turn 3275)
- **Absolute Priority:** Heal SPROUT (8/25 HP) at a Pokémon Center. All other activities are secondary.
- **Navigation Strategy (Viridian Forest Escape):** Use simple, direct manual navigation with short, verifiable segments towards the South Gate. Avoid complex detours or agent experimentation until SPROUT is healed.
- **Agent Management:**
    - Defer all agent development, definition, and testing (especially `advanced_pathfinder_agent` and `pathing_script_analyzer_agent`) to safe, non-time-sensitive locations (e.g., Pokémon Center).
    - Cease using `advanced_pathfinder_agent` for critical navigation until fixed.
    - Log issues with `direct_pathing_agent` for fixing or deletion later.
    - Action `move_validator_agent` idea (define or discard) when safe.
    - Review utility of low-usage agents when safe.
- **Notepad Efficiency:**
    - Consolidate administrative tasks and be concise.
    - Summarize repeated agent failures instead of logging each instance.
- **Key Learnings:**
    - Repel Hypothesis (Confirmed by critique): Lead Pokémon's level must be *strictly greater* than wild Pokémon's level for Repel to be effective in this ROM hack.
- **Current Turn Count:** 3275. Be mindful of turn count accuracy.

# Repel Mechanics (New Hypothesis - Turn 3247)
*   Repel may require the lead Pokémon's level to be **strictly greater** than the wild Pokémon's level to be effective. 
    *   Observation: Encountered Lv7 Kakuna (Turn 3218) and Lv7 Pidgey (Turn 3239) while SPROUT (Lv7) was leading and Repel was active. Repel failed in both instances.
    *   Previous assumption: Repel worked if lead level was equal to or greater. This seems incorrect for this ROM hack.

# Agent Performance Notes (Turn 3248)
*   `exploration_planner` agent: Confirmed it cannot generate a path to a specific, known, *seen* tile. Its purpose is strictly for 'Reachable Unseen Tiles'.

# Viridian Forest Navigation Update (Turn 3320)
*   Current Position: (14,17), facing Down. Pikachu at (14,16).
*   SPROUT HP: 8/25 (CRITICAL). Healing at Pokémon Center is top priority.
*   Repel active, SPARKY (Lv12) leading.
*   Obstacle: Youngster (ID 6, VIRIDIANFOREST_YOUNGSTER5) at (14,18) blocks direct southward path. This is the trainer I previously blacked out to (noted as Bug Catcher in error, ID 6 is correct).
*   Corrected Path Segment (Turn 3321): (14,17) -> (15,17) -> (15,18) -> (15,19) -> (15,20) -> (16,20) -> (17,20). From (17,20), plan to head south towards South Gate (17,48). The previous plan involving (15,21) was incorrect as (15,21) is impassable.

# Critique Takeaways & Goal Adjustments (Turn 3326)
- **Goal Hierarchy Adjustment:**
    - Primary Goal: Obtain the Boulder Badge from the Pewter City Gym Leader, Brock.
    - Secondary Goal: IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Heal SPROUT (8/25 HP) at Viridian City Pokémon Center. All other actions are secondary until SPROUT is safe.
    - Tertiary Goal: After SPROUT is healed and if funds are low, defeat Youngster (ID 6) in Viridian Forest to acquire money for Potions.
- **Agent Management (Pokémon Center Tasks):**
    - Evaluate utility of low-usage agents (`battle_strategist_agent`, `item_finder_agent`, `pokedex_completer_agent`, `team_builder_agent`, `financial_planner_agent`). Refine or delete as needed.
    - Define `move_validator_agent` or remove the note.
    - Continue with plan to use `pathing_script_analyzer_agent` on A* script.
- **NPC Movement:** Be more cautious about assuming NPC positions are static, as Youngster (ID 6) moved and intercepted me.
- Defeated Youngster (ID 6, VIRIDIANFOREST_YOUNGSTER5) at (15,18) in Viridian Forest (Caterpie Lv6, Metapod Lv6). Gained ¥60. Current money: ¥156. (SPARKY level capped, gained 0 actual EXP).

# Reflection Insights (Turn 3347)
*   **Viridian Forest NPC Watch:** Youngster (ID 10) is at (28,41) facing right. My current path along column 27 should avoid him. Youngster (ID 1) at (17,44) is facing down, so passing through (17,44) should be safe.
*   **New Agent Ideas:**
    *   `move_validator_agent`: Takes a path and `map_xml_string`, verifies each step against map data (navigability, tile types, NPC locations if provided) and outputs path validity or first invalid step. Useful for debugging pathing agents/scripts.
    *   `NPC_interaction_planner_agent`: Given NPC ID, location, facing, and player's location/facing, suggests optimal tile and button presses for dialogue.

*   **Pending Agent Tasks (Pokémon Center):**
    *   Use `pathing_script_analyzer_agent` on the A* script / `advanced_pathfinder_agent` logic.
    *   Evaluate utility of low-usage agents (`battle_strategist_agent`, `item_finder_agent`, `pokedex_completer_agent`, `team_builder_agent`, `financial_planner_agent`). Refine or delete.
    *   Decide on defining `move_validator_agent` (from above) or remove the note.

# NPC Behavior Update (Turn 3349)
*   Youngster (ID 1) at (17,44) in Viridian Forest turned from facing Down to facing Left, blocking my intended path. This highlights that NPC facing direction can change, and they can become obstacles.

# Critique Takeaways & Action Plan (Turn 3350)
- **Agent Development (Pokémon Center Task):**
    - Prioritize defining `move_validator_agent`.
    - Cease using `advanced_pathfinder_agent` until it can be reliably fixed or replaced. Add to list of agents to analyze/delete.
- **Financial Planning (Pokémon Center Task):** Current funds ¥156. Potions cost ¥200. Plan for money acquisition after healing SPROUT.
- **Navigation:** Be more careful with manual path planning. Verify against map memory. The `move_validator_agent` should help in the future.
- **Repel Usage:** Maintain active Repel when SPROUT is critically injured in dangerous areas.

# Viridian Forest South Gate (Turn 3353)
*   Successfully exited Viridian Forest. Currently in Viridian Forest South Gate at (6,2).
*   SPROUT HP: 8/25 (CRITICAL). Healing at Pokémon Center is top priority.
*   Repel active, SPARKY (Lv12) leading.
*   Goal: Exit South Gate to Route 2, then head to Viridian City Pokémon Center.

# Pokémon Center Tasks (Viridian City - Turn 3368)
*   **Agent Management (Priority):**
    *   Define `move_validator_agent` (High priority given recent pathing issues).
    *   Use `pathing_script_analyzer_agent` on the A* script and `advanced_pathfinder_agent` logic to diagnose failures.
    *   Formally mark `advanced_pathfinder_agent` for deletion or major overhaul; cease current usage.
    *   Evaluated low-usage agents. Deleted `battle_strategist_agent`. Others seem fine for now.
    *   `NPC_interaction_planner_agent` defined. Consider creating `run_code` script for Repel effectiveness later.
    *   Test `npc_interaction_planner_agent` on Cool Trainer M (5,4).
*   **Financial Planning:**
    *   Current funds: ¥156. Potions cost ¥200. Need at least ¥44 more for one Potion.
    *   Investigate money-making opportunities after healing (e.g., re-battlable trainers if they exist in this ROM hack, or un-fought trainers).

# Agent Management Update (Turn 3404 - Viridian City)
*   Successfully defined `move_validator_agent`. This brings the total active agents to 10 (the maximum allowed).

# NPC Behavior Summary (Turns 3407-3424 - Viridian City)
*   Youngster (ID 1) has been extremely mobile, frequently changing positions (e.g., (12,19), (9,19), (16,20), (13,20), (10,22), (11,23), (9,20), (12,23), (10,21), (10,18)) between turns 3407 and 3424. This has made interaction attempts consistently fail, rendering reactive pursuit highly inefficient. An `npc_interaction_planner_agent` call on turn 3406 was quickly outdated. An 'A' press on turn 3415 failed due to NPC movement.

# Strategic Shift (Turn 3431 - Viridian City)
*   **Abandoning Youngster (ID 1) Pursuit:** After numerous failed attempts (Turns 3406-3430) due to the NPC's constant movement, I am abandoning efforts to battle Youngster (ID 1) in Viridian City. This pursuit has proven highly inefficient and is stalling progress on acquiring funds.
*   **New Financial Strategy:** Will now head north to Route 2 to find other trainers and earn money for Potions. Current funds: ¥156. Need at least ¥44 more for one Potion.

# Viridian Forest Notes
*   Youngster (ID 1, VIRIDIANFOREST_YOUNGSTER1) at (17,44) is not a battlable trainer, only provides dialogue ('I came here with some friends! They're out for POKéMON fights!'). This occurred after approaching him from (17,45) and pressing 'A' on Turn 3471. Does not initiate battle on sight or after dialogue completion.
*   Youngster (ID 10, VIRIDIANFOREST_YOUNGSTER6) at (28,41) is not a battlable trainer, only provides dialogue ('You should carry extras!'). This occurred after approaching him from (28,42) and pressing 'A' on Turn 3483. Does not initiate battle on sight or after dialogue completion.

# New Agent Ideas (Currently at 10/10 agent limit - requires deletion of existing agent or discarding ideas)
*   **Agent Management Note:** At the next safe opportunity (e.g., Pokémon Center), I will review these new agent ideas. For each, I will decide whether to pursue defining it (which would require deleting an existing, less useful agent to free up a slot) or to discard the idea if it's no longer deemed necessary or high-priority. Agent ideas should not remain in limbo.
*   **Route Progress Analyzer Agent Idea:** Takes `map_xml_string` and current position to analyze progress on linear routes, identifying remaining trainers/items based on known data or notes.
*   **Risk Assessor Agent Idea:** Inputs: party status, current location (e.g., Viridian Forest, known wild Pokémon levels), distance to Pokémon Center. Output: risk level (low, medium, high) of proceeding vs. retreating.

*   **`direct_pathing_agent` (Needs Investigation):** My notes refer to this agent and its issues (Pikachu on target, turn+move logic). However, it's not currently listed among my 10 defined agents. At the next Pokémon Center: verify if this agent was deleted, never properly defined, or if I'm confusing it with the A* `run_code` script. If it doesn't exist, remove these notes.

# Navigation Strategy & Best Practices
*   **Path Planning:** Break down navigation into shorter, verifiable segments (e.g., 3-5 tiles or 5-10 steps), especially in complex areas like Viridian Forest. Verify path navigability frequently using map memory before committing to long movements.
*   **Repel Usage:** Ensure Repel is active when navigating dense areas if the intent is to avoid encounters, especially when lead Pokémon are level-capped or not being used for training.
*   **Map Marker Usage:** Consistently mark defeated trainers, confirmed dead ends, and frequently used warps on the map to aid in long-term spatial understanding and avoid re-exploring fruitless paths.
*   **Repel Usage:** Ensure Repel is active when navigating dense areas if the intent is to avoid encounters, especially when lead Pokémon are level-capped or not being used for training.
*   **Map Marker Usage:** Consistently mark defeated trainers, confirmed dead ends, and frequently used warps on the map to aid in long-term spatial understanding and avoid re-exploring fruitless paths.
*   **Repel Usage:** Ensure Repel is active when navigating dense areas if the intent is to avoid encounters, especially when lead Pokémon are level-capped or not being used for training.
*   **Map Marker Usage:** Consistently mark defeated trainers, confirmed dead ends, and frequently used warps on the map to aid in long-term spatial understanding and avoid re-exploring fruitless paths.
