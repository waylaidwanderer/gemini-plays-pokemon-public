# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Timestamp:** Turn 25602 (Jan 6, 2026)
- **Primary Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Immediate Task:** Reach the Northwest area of Silver Cave Outside.
- Current Location: Silver Cave Room 1 (8, 26).
- Objective: Collect Item Ball at (5, 30).
- Strategy: Flank Left via Row 25.
- Plan:
    1. Navigate North to (8, 25).
    2. Go West to x=5 or x=3.
    3. Explore South to see if I can reach Row 30.
    4. Note: There appears to be a corridor at x=5,6 blocked at the bottom by walls. Check for hidden mechanics.

# Tile Mechanics & Observations
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT:** Standard one-way jumpable tiles.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Inconsistent behavior observed.
    - **Confirmed Ledge:** (39, 32) allowed jumping South.
    - **Confirmed Wall:** (6, 30) and (28, 34) blocked movement South.
    - **Strategy:** Treat as WALL unless verified otherwise.
- **Navigation Notes:**
    - The "Central" area (x=5) connects to the West path via Row 22 (re-verified via Mental Map).
    - Row 30 acts as a hard barrier across most of the map, separating the North and South sections.
