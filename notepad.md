# Lessons Learned
- Menu Precision: Slow down during move learning and item usage. Double-check before confirming.
- Route 41 Navigation: Row 29 is a reliable corridor west.
- Ecruteak Gym Path: (3,9)->(3,7)->(6,7)->(6,5)->(7,5)->Martha; (6,5)->(5,5)->(5,1)->Morty.
- Moomoo Farm: Sick Miltank needs 7 standard BERRY items.
- Input Handling: Do not mix directional and action buttons in the same `press_buttons` call.
- NPC Interaction: Face the counter, not the NPC, to interact with Nurses/Clerks.

# Battle Strategy: Cianwood Gym (Chuck)
- Type: Fighting.
- Weaknesses: Flying, Psychic.
- My Team Analysis:
  - Calcifer (QUILAVA) Lv31: Main attacker. Flame Wheel/Headbutt. Neutral typing.
  - GNEISS (GRAVELER) Lv34: Weak to Fighting. Defensive backup only.
  - KIMCHI (ODDISH) Lv10: Poison resists Fighting. Needs training.
- Strategy: Level up Calcifer. Look for a Flying-type (e.g. Pidgey/Pidgeotto) or Psychic-type. Use Ravioli (Krabby) for Surf if needed.
