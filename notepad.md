# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) in Cianwood City to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The West Beach Highway
- Plan:
  1. Use Super Repel. [DONE]
  2. Walk to West Beach (X=2) via gaps in city walls (e.g., Row 33, 44).
  3. Walk North along West Beach (X=2) to (2, 14).
  4. Walk East to (8, 14), then North to (8, 12).
  5. Walk East along Row 12 to (14, 12), then North to (14, 10).
- Status: At (25, 37) on land. Repel active.
- Reasoning: City is partitioned by vertical walls (X=5, X=9) and cliffs (Row 30, Row 34, Row 46). Horizontal Arteries (Rows 33, 44, 12) are the only way to cross. X=2 is a clear vertical highway past the central blockades.

# Blocked Routes (Verified)
- Central City: Vertical walls at X=5 (Rows 30-33) and X=9 (Rows 34-37).
- Row 30/34/46 Cliffs: Impassable FLOOR_UP_WALL barriers.
- Inner Channel: Buoy wall at Row 15 (X=18-22).

# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard ground. Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Surf required. Traversable.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable cliff face.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
