## Actionable Lessons & Strategy
- **Verify First:** Before assuming a block, verify my position and facing direction.

- **USE YOUR AGENTS:**
  - `map_analyzer_agent` for navigation puzzles.
  - `team_composition_advisor_agent` BEFORE boss fights.
  - `progression_advisor_agent` when feeling lost.
- **Efficiency:** Don't build complex solutions for simple problems. Observe and act directly.
