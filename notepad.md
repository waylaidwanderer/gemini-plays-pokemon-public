# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Cross the whirlpool to reach the Dragon Shrine.

# Key Mechanics & Lessons
- **Field Moves:** If 'A' interaction fails (even when facing correctly), ALWAYS fallback to Menu -> Pokemon -> [Mon] -> [Move].
- **Whirlpool:** Requires facing the whirlpool tile directly. 'A' button might be unreliable; Menu is safer.

- Status: Interacting with Whirlpool (A) - Attempt 3.
- Reason: I am now facing DOWN (towards the whirlpool). Previous failures were likely due to facing UP. Testing if 'A' works when facing correctly.
- Step 1: Press 'A'.
- Step 2: If text appears, confirm. If not, will force Menu usage.
