# Route 3 Navigation Plan
- **Current Position:** Route 3 (Lower Path).
- **Insight:** Route 3 has two distinct paths separated by walls from Pewter City:
    1. **Upper Path** (Enter from Pewter at y=14): Leads to Mt. Moon Entrance (Row 1).
    2. **Lower Path** (Enter from Pewter at y=18): Leads to blocked areas/dead ends.
- **Correction:** I am currently on the Lower Path. I must return to Pewter City and switch to the Upper Path.
- **Plan:**
  1. Return to Pewter City (Walk Left).
  2. Explored North (Rows 1-11): Blocked by walls/ledges. Found Berry Trees.
  3. Conclusion: The exit at Row 16 is the northernmost exit.
  4. Plan: Exit at (39, 16). This leads to Route 3 (0, 6).
  5. Analysis: Pewter Exit at Row 16 leads to Route 3 Row 6 (Middle Lane).
  6. Route 3 Middle Lane (Row 6) is a dead end blocked by walls.
  7. Route 3 Upper Lane (Row 4) is the correct path to Mt. Moon.
  8. Deduction: I must exit Pewter City at Row 14 (leads to Route 3 Row 4).
  9. Problem: Access to Pewter Row 14 is blocked at x=34 by a wall.
  10. Plan: Return to Pewter, explore x=34 around y=13-15 to find a way around the wall.
  3. Re-enter Route 3 from the Upper Lane (y=14).
  4. Traverse Route 3 along the top edge to Mt. Moon.
- **Next Action:** Walk Left to Pewter City.
