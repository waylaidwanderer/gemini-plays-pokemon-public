- WALL: Impassable boundary.
- WATER: Traversable while Surfing.
- BUOY: Impassable water barrier.
- WHIRLPOOL: Requires HM06 to cross.
- HEADBUTT_TREE: Impassable boundary.

## League Analyst Advice [Turn 35458]
- Evaluation: Team is top-heavy (Typhlosion 49, Graveler 48). Others are underleveled (Haunter 37, others <20).
- Key Threats: Will's Psychic-types (outspeed/OHKO Haunter). Lance's Dragonites (lack of Ice coverage).
- Recommendations:
  - Level XENON (Haunter) to 45+. Teach it TM24 DragonBreath if not evolved.
  - Replace ICARUS (Pidgey) and Ravioli (Krabby) with high-level encounters (e.g., Red Gyarados or gift Dratini).
  - Evolve KIMCHI (Gloom) using a Sun or Leaf Stone.
  - Use Gneiss (Graveler) with Earthquake for Koga/Bruno, but avoid Bruno's Fighting-types.
  - Strategy: Buy TM33 Ice Punch in Goldenrod for Typhlosion.
- Training Goal: Level all active party members (especially Xenon) to 45+ for the Pokémon League.
- Master Ball: Obtained from Prof. Elm [Turn 35463]. Save for legendary beasts (Suicune, Raikou, Entei).
