# Global Knowledge
## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard.
- WALL/SHUTTER: Impassable. Shutters change state via switches.
- COUNTER: Interact from front.
- WARP_CARPET: Transition.
- STAIRCASE/LADDER: Warp.

## Progress Tracking
- Badges: 7/16 (Johto: 7/8).
- PC: SHUCKIE (Lv15), ROCKY (Lv6), EGG (Lv5), XFDW (Lv16), FRITTATA (Lv5).
- Battle: Menu transitions need 1000ms delay. Move menu wraps and remembers position.

# Switch Room Puzzle (Map 3_54)
- Entry: 3_53 (18, 6) Basement Door -> (22, 27) Ladder.
- Switch 1 (16, 1): Discovered.
- Switch 2 (10, 1): Discovered. Turned ON at Turn 9094.
- Switch 3: Searching.
- Observation: Shutters at (12, 2), (13, 2), (18, 2), (19, 2) etc. appear to be influenced by switches.
- Hypothesis: Switches 1, 2, and 3 must be in a specific ON/OFF configuration to open the path to the Warehouse (likely south/west).

## Hypotheses
- Card Key: The real Director likely has the Card Key needed for the Radio Tower shutters.
