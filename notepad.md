# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- **Start Turn:** 48900
- **Current Status:** At (12, 28). Initiating southern bypass route via Surf.

## Execution Plan (Southern Bypass)
1. Use Super Repel. (Turn 49406) <- CURRENT TASK
2. Move Up to (12, 27) and use Surf.
3. Surf East to (27, 27), then South to (27, 51).
4. Land at (24, 51).
5. Walk West to (2, 51), then North to (2, 12).
6. Walk East to (14, 12), then North to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

## Strategy: Southern Bypass
The city is a maze of one-way ledges (Row 34, 46, 48, 50) and walls. Terrestrial paths are blocked. The only reliable way to reach the western corridor (X=2) is to Surf all the way to the southern edge of the map (Row 51) where the barriers end. This bypass avoids the entire city maze.

## Failed Hypotheses & Lessons
- Terrestrial Path (South): Blocked by multiple ledge lines.
- Terrestrial Path (West): Blocked by wall lines at X=11, 9, 5, 3.
- Inner Channel Water Path: Entirely blocked by buoy walls (Row 9, Row 25). Must use island hop.
- Island Hop Landing (13, 16): Dead end due to walls at Row 13/15.
- Narrow Channel (X=12): Blocked at Row 15 by buoy wall.

## Tile Mechanics (Global)
- **FLOOR**: Traversable ground.
- **WALL**: Impassable barrier.
- **WATER**: Requires Surf HM.
- **BUOY**: Impassable water barrier.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL**: Blocks DOWN (South) movement.
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN**: Blocks NORTH movement.
- **DOOR**: Warp entry point.

## Inventory Check
- Super Repel: 4 remaining.
- Party: Calcifer (Lv 64) leads. Ready for Eusine.

## Progress Summary
- All 16 Badges obtained.
- Elite Four/Red defeated.
- Current Focus: Suicune tracking.
