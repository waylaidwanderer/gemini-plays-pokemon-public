## Strategy: Row 50 Terrestrial Bypass to Suicune
**Start Turn:** 48900 (Quest: Trigger Suicune Overworld Sighting)

Cianwood's internal walls and ledges are bypassed by a clear terrestrial path at the southern end of the city.

### Step-by-Step Execution Plan
1. Walk to (24, 50). <- CURRENT TASK
2. Walk West along Row 50 to (2, 50) (West Beach Highway).
   - This path crosses Strip 5 (X=24), Strip 4 (X=19-12), and Strip 3 (X=10-6).
   - FLOOR_UP_WALL tiles at Row 50 (X=19 to X=12) allow East-West movement.
3. Walk North along the West Beach Highway (X=2) to (2, 14).
4. Walk East along the Row 14 corridor to (8, 14).
5. Walk North along X=8 to (8, 12) to enter the plateau.
6. Walk East along Row 12 to (14, 12), then North to (14, 10).
7. Trigger Suicune sighting.

## Tile Mechanics: Cianwood City
- FLOOR: Standard traversable ground.
- WALL: Impassable barrier.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way ledge. Blocks DOWN movement (Y to Y+1). Allows UP and East-West movement. (Verified at (6, 46)).

## Navigation: Landmarks
- Strip 5 (X=20-25): Clear North-South passage.
- West Beach Highway (X=2): Clear North-South passage from Row 53 to Row 14.
- Row 50 Bypass: Only terrestrial route connecting the East Shore to the West Beach.

## Inventory Check
- Super Repel: 5 remaining. Last applied turn 49278. (~140 steps remaining).
- Party: Calcifer (Lv 64) leads. Ready for Eusine.

## Failed Hypotheses & Lessons
- Route 40 Bypass: Dead end on the West.
- Row 8/15/18/21 Buoy Gaps: Blocked or inefficient compared to land.
- Southern Rim (Row 52/53): Blocked by Gym walls or water at various points.
