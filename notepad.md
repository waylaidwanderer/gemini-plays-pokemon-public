# Suicune Capture Strategy
- Lead: XENON (Haunter, Lv44).
- Move 1: Hypnosis (Sleep). Accuracy is key.
- Move 2: Night Shade (44 dmg). Suicune (Lv40) has ~120 HP. Use twice for Red health.
- Move 3: Dream Eater (100 power). Only works if Suicune is asleep.
- Item: Ultra Balls (32).
- Backup: GORP (Snorlax) as a tank. Calcifer (Typhlosion) is risky due to type disadvantage.

# Strategic Plan: The West Beach Sprint
- Start Turn: 48151.
- Step 1: Land at (19, 30). (Done)
- Step 2: Walk to Suicune sighting spot at (14, 10) via land route. (In Progress)
- Route: (19, 30) -> (19, 32) -> (9, 32) -> (9, 33) -> (6, 33) -> (6, 35) -> (5, 35) -> (2, 35) -> (2, 14) -> (8, 14) -> (8, 12) -> (14, 10).
- Status: XENON leading, Repel active, Pokefan M (ID 2) stunned.

# Lessons Learned
- Pathing: The city center is a plateau; land routes to the west beach exist via the gap at (5, 35).
- Navigation: Row 15 is a wall from X=3 to X=17, but X=0-2 is a clear corridor.
- Blockage: (7, 45) is a Gym Sign. (5, 44) is a WALL. (6, 46) is a ledge face.
- NPC: Pokefan M at (18, 33) can block the way; he is currently stunned.
