# Goldenrod Underground Switch Puzzle

## Current Status
- **Location:** Switch Room (3_54), Central Area.
- **Objective:** Explore Inner East Section.
- **Goal:** Rescue Director / Find Warehouse.

## Switch Logic (Confirmed)
- **S1 (16, 1):** East/West Toggle.
    - **ON:** Opens East Gate `(12, 8)`. Closes West Gate `(6, 8)`.
    - **OFF:** Opens West Gate `(6, 8)`. Closes East Gate `(12, 8)`.
    - **Current State:** OFF. West Gate `(6, 8)` is OPEN. (Verified Turn 14797).
- **S2 (10, 1):** Main Power.
    - **ON:** Required for gates to operate. (Currently ON).
- **S3 (2, 1):** Emergency Override.
    - **OFF:** (Currently OFF).
- **Shutters:** `(17, 6)` and `(20, 6)` remain CLOSED with S1=ON/S2=ON/S3=OFF.

## Lessons Learned
- **Tool Logic:** `autopress_buttons` requires the tool to output a JSON list of strings.
- **Navigation:** `path_plan` MUST include the current position as the first element. Omitting it causes misalignment.

## Plan
1. Move to `(13, 8)` inside the Inner East Section.
   - Path: Down to `(10, 8)`, then Right through Gate `(12, 8)`.
2. Navigate to the warp at `(22, 10)`.
3. Enter the warp and explore the destination (likely the Director's location).

## Observations
- **Switch 1 (16, 1):** ON.
- **Switch 2 (10, 1):** ON.
- **Switch 3 (2, 1):** OFF.
- **Gate Status:**
  - North Gate `(10, 6)`: OPEN.
  - East Gate `(12, 8)`: OPEN.
  - West Gate `(6, 8)`: CLOSED.
- **Hypothesis:** We have successfully routed power to the East Gate.
## Reflection (Turn 14911)
- **Tool Maintenance:** Deleted `find_path` as it was broken and returning empty lists. Will rely on manual navigation or build a better pathfinder later if needed.
- **Current Situation:** Accessed the area behind the East Gate at `(13, 8)`. It appears to be a small room `(13,8)-(17,9)` separated from the south by walls. Need to check for hidden switches or items.
- **Puzzle:** The warp at `(22, 10)` is likely behind the shutters `(17, 6)` or `(20, 6)`. If this room is a dead end, I need to figure out how to open those shutters.
