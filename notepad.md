# Route 3 Navigation Plan
- **Current Position:** Route 3 (Lower Path).
- **Insight:** Route 3 has two distinct paths separated by walls from Pewter City:
    1. **Upper Path** (Enter from Pewter at y=14): Leads to Mt. Moon Entrance (Row 1).
    2. **Lower Path** (Enter from Pewter at y=18): Leads to blocked areas/dead ends.
- **Correction:** I am currently on the Lower Path. I must return to Pewter City and switch to the Upper Path.
- **Plan:**
  1. Return to Pewter City (Walk Left).
  2. Explored North (Rows 1-11): Blocked by walls/ledges. Found Berry Trees.
  3. Conclusion: The exit at Row 16 is the northernmost exit.
  4. Plan: Exit at (39, 16). This leads to Route 3 (0, 6).
  5. Verified: Route 3 Row 6 & 7 are blocked by a WALL at x=13 (Seen in Mental Map).
  6. Verified: Lower Lane (Row 10+) is blocked by a WALL at x=19 (Seen in Mental Map).
  7. Conclusion: The ONLY way forward is the Upper Lane (Rows 2-4).
  8. Ledges (Row 5) prevent access from below. Must enter Upper Lane from Pewter City.
  9. New Strategy: The Route 3 Upper Lane (Rows 2-4) starts at x=0, meaning there IS an exit from Pewter at Row 2, 3, or 4.
  10. My previous exploration of Northeast Pewter (around the Berry Trees) was incomplete. I likely failed to check East of the trees.
  11. Plan: Return to Pewter City. Go North through the gap at (31, 7).
  12. Navigate to Row 3 or 4.
  13. Walk EAST towards x=39. Do not stop at the Berry Trees.
  14. Verify if there is an exit at (39, 2), (39, 3), or (39, 4).
  3. Re-enter Route 3 from the Upper Lane (y=14).
  4. Traverse Route 3 along the top edge to Mt. Moon.
- **Next Action:** Walk Left to Pewter City.
