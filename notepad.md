- COUNTER: Interact from adjacent tile.
- HEADBUTT_TREE/CUT_TREE: Impassable; Cut removes Cut Trees.

# Lessons Learned
- Menu Navigation: Scrolling in the Pokedex is sensitive; use fewer 'Down' presses and verify current selection before clicking 'AREA'.
- Pathing: Objects like Fruit Trees block movement; always check 'Map Objects' before planning a path through a tile.
