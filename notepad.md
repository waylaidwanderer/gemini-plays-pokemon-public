# Game Mechanics & Systems
## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR / TALL_GRASS: Walkable.
- WALL / COUNTER / FLOOR_UP_WALL (from North): Impassable.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN (⤵️): One-way jump North to South.
- Blackthorn Elevation: Tiered city separated by ledges/walls. Gaps allow Northward walking (e.g., 13,17; 9,21; 13,23).
- Pits (Blackthorn Gym): Drop the player to the same coordinates on the floor below.

# Pokemon & Party Information
## Strategy for Gym Leader Clair
- Clair's Team: Dragonair x3 (Lv37), Kingdra (Lv40).
- Matchups: Dragon resists Fire, Water, Electric, Grass. Kingdra is only weak to Dragon. Haunter (Xenon) is immune to Normal. Haunter's Night Shade does fixed damage (36). Haunter's Hypnosis/Confuse Ray can disable.
- Tactical Plan:
  - Lead Calcifer (Lv49): Use Return for high neutral damage.
  - Xenon (Lv36): Backup for Hypnosis/Confuse Ray support.
  - Gneiss (Lv48): Backup, but beware of Surf/Ice Beam.

# Exploration Strategy
- Current Goal: Reach Clair.
- Hypothesis: Falling through the pit at (2, 5) on 2F will drop the player into the central area of 1F, providing a direct path to Clair at (5, 3).
- Boulder Status: Boulder 6 (3, 3), Boulder 7 (6, 1), Boulder 8 (8, 14) are NOT yet pushed. Verification of pit-fill mechanic needed if direct fall fails.
