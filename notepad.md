# Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Acts as a South-facing Ledge (verified). Blocks North movement.
- **Maze Solution:** x=13 is the main North-South corridor. x=8 connects to the item area.
- **Navigation Notes:**
    - Central Area (x=8, y=2) is a dead end.
    - Potential path North located at x=14 (accessed via row 6 crossing).
    - Ledges at (4, 7) and (5, 7) trap the player. Escape is South.
    - x=9 is blocked at y=11 and y=14-17. Use x=13.
    - Wall at (4, 5) blocks direct South movement.
