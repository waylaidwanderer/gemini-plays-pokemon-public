# Gem's Pokémon Crystal Adventure Log

## I. Core Principles & Lessons Learned
*   Trust Your Tools: A verified tool's output is a source of truth. Trust it over assumptions.
*   Systematic Debugging: Use a methodical, evidence-based approach for broken tools. Use `run_code` with print statements to trace execution.
*   Immediate Action: Tool/agent maintenance must be performed in the current turn. A one-turn delay is a failure.
*   Hypothesis-Driven Testing: For all new mechanics, use the Observe, Hypothesize, Test, Conclude method. Document every step.
*   Goal Flexibility: If progress on a primary goal stalls, pivot to a different goal. Do not remain stuck.
*   Proactive Tile Testing: Upon encountering any new, undocumented tile type, I MUST immediately form a hypothesis, test it, and log the results before proceeding.
*   Mark Warps Immediately: Mark both warp entrance and exit immediately upon use.
*   Verify Agent Outputs: Always verify agent claims (e.g., item possession) against the direct game state before acting.

## III. System & Tool Performance Log
*   System Alert Verifications:
    *   Ilex Forest Unseen Tiles: I have previously confirmed that the system-flagged unseen tiles are unreachable, blocked by the CUT_TREE at (8, 25). I will continue to ignore this alert until I obtain HM01 Cut.
*   Agent & Tool Failures:
    *   `goal_manager` Hallucination (Turn 21825): The agent incorrectly stated that I possessed HM01 Cut. This was proven false by checking my bag. Correction (Turn 21865): The agent's system prompt was updated to be stricter about item possession.
    *   `path_finder` Failure (Turn 21869): The tool generated an invalid path through a stationary NPC. Correction (Turn 21871): The tool's script was updated to check for the `has-object='true'` tile attribute.
    *   `path_finder` Dynamic Obstacle Failure (Turn 24138): The tool generated a path through a tile that was temporarily blocked by a moving NPC (GRAMPS, ID 2). Conclusion: The tool's logic is sound, but my strategy must account for dynamic obstacles. Temporarily freezing key NPCs may be a valid tactic for reliable navigation in cluttered areas.
*   Overwatch Critique Note (Turn 24151): The critique mentioned undocumented tile types (`FLOWERBED`, `LEDGE`, `ROOF`). A review of the map data for Azalea Town confirms that `FLOWERBED` and `ROOF` tiles are not present. The only `LEDGE` type is `LEDGE_HOP_DOWN`, which is already documented. This part of the critique appears to be based on incorrect information.

## V. Tile Traversal Rules
*   Traversable: TALL_GRASS, LONG_GRASS, DOOR, LADDER, FLOOR, WARP_CARPET_RIGHT, WARP_CARPET_DOWN.
*   Impassable (Verified): WALL, WINDOW, CUT_TREE, SIGN, BOOKSHELF, BLACKBOARD, MART_SHELF, BUOY, TV, TOWN_MAP, BIRD, HEADBUTT_TREE, FRUIT_TREE, PRINTER, WATER, CAVE, PC, VOID, COUNTER.
*   One-Way Traversal:
    *   LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: A one-way ledge. Can only be entered from a tile directly above it (Y-1 -> Y), which forces movement to the tile below it (Y -> Y+1).
    *   LEDGE_HOP_RIGHT: Can only be entered from the left.
    *   LEDGE_HOP_LEFT: Can only be entered from the right.
*   Special Interaction (Warp):
    *   CAVE: Can act as a one-way warp.
    *   WARP_CARPET_DOWN: Activated by walking onto it.
*   Special Interaction (Interactable):
    *   PC: Interact by standing below it at (X, Y+1), facing up.
    *   COUNTER: Interact with NPCs behind it by standing in front of the counter. (Impassability confirmed Turn 25022).

## VI. Story & Quests
*   **Primary Quest:** Become the Pokémon League Champion.
    *   Current Objective: Get the Plain Badge in Goldenrod City.
*   **Completed Quests:**
    *   Zephyr Badge: Defeated Falkner in Violet City.
    *   Hive Badge: Defeated Bugsy in Azalea Town.
    *   HM01 Cut: Rescued the Farfetch'd in Ilex Forest.
*   **Side Quests & NPC Hints:**
    *   Kurt's Custom Balls: Wait one day for Kurt to finish making a custom ball. (Blocked by time).
    *   Union Cave Roars: Investigate on a Friday. (Blocked by time).
    *   Bug-Catching Contest: At the National Park.
    *   Strange Tree: A strange tree blocks Route 36.

## VIII. Team Strategy & Analysis
*   `team_analyst` Report (Turn 24443):
    *   Training Priority: Miasma.
    *   Move Recommendations: For Vulcan, replace EMBER with a coverage TM. For Miasma, keep HYPNOSIS and CURSE, but replace the weak LICK when possible. For Gambit, focus on raising happiness for evolution.
    *   Team Weaknesses: Severe weakness to Ground-type attacks. Lack of coverage against Water and Rock types. A Grass or Water-type Pokémon is needed for balance.

## X. Failed Hypotheses & Corrections
*   **Trigger Path Hypothesis (Failed):** My hypothesis that walking from (26, 24) to (20, 24) would make the Farfetch'd reappear at (15, 25) was incorrect. Instead, walking this path caused the entire puzzle to reset, with the Farfetch'd returning to its starting position at (29, 22). This implies an unknown reset trigger exists along that path.

## XI. Untested Assumptions & Falsification
*   **Assumption 1:** The only way to exit Ilex Forest is through the northern gatehouse to Route 34.
*   **Alternative Hypothesis:** There may be another exit, possibly requiring an HM like Surf to cross the water areas.
*   **Test Plan:** If I fully explore all currently accessible paths and do not find the exit, I will systematically re-explore the forest's boundaries to look for hidden paths or interactions.
*   **Assumption 2:** The only way forward from the Route 34 Gatehouse is through the northern warp.
*   **Alternative Hypothesis:** The NPCs in the gatehouse might provide a key item or trigger an event that opens a new path, or this could be a dead end.
*   **Test Plan:** Talk to all NPCs in the gatehouse before attempting to exit north.
*   **Hidden Item Interaction (Testing):** Attempting to pick up the hidden Super Potion at (4, 18) in Goldenrod Underground.
    *   **Hypothesis 1 (Failed, Turn 25104):** Interaction requires standing *on* the item tile.
        *   Test: Stood on (4, 18) and pressed A while facing Up, Down, Left, and Right.
        *   Result: Failed.
    *   **Hypothesis 2 (Failed, Turn 25104):** Interaction requires standing *below* the item tile.
        *   Test: Stood on (4, 19), faced up, and pressed A.
        *   Result: Failed.
    *   **Hypothesis 3 (In Progress, Turn 25171):** Interaction requires standing *adjacent* to the item tile.
        *   Test 3a: Stand at (3, 18) [left of item], face right, and press A.
