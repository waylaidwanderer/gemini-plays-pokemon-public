- TALL_GRASS / LONG_GRASS: Traversable, wild encounters.
- HEADBUTT_TREE: Impassable, interact for encounter.
- WARP_CARPET_RIGHT / LEFT: Traversable, triggers map transition.

# Route 38/39 Mechanics & Exploration
- Lane Analysis:
  - Top Lane (Rows 0-6): Fragmented by walls. 
    - Western Pocket (X=0-2): Isolated from south/east. Check Route 39.
    - Middle Pocket A (X=4-5): Reachable via gap at (4, 7).
    - Middle Pocket B (X=8-9): Reachable via gap at (8, 7).
    - Eastern Strip (X=16-35): Reachable via Ecruteak or gaps at X=30-35.
  - Path Complexity: Walking East is possible by detouring through the southern floor path (Row 14-16) and exiting North at (9, 14) -> (9, 13).
- Search Log:
  - Top Lane Eastern Strip (X=16-35): Searched. No Suicune.
  - Top Lane Middle Pocket A (X=4-5): Searched. No Suicune.
  - Top Lane Middle Pocket B (X=8-9): Searched. No Suicune.
  - Southern Path (X=4-13): Searched. No Suicune.
  - Top Lane Western Pocket (X=0-2): Unexplored.
  - Route 39 Barn: Searched. No Suicune.
- Current Plan: 
  1. Search Southern Path extension (X=22-29) on Route 38.
  2. Investigate Western Pocket (X=0-2) via Route 39.
  3. Head to National Park for Quick Claw.

# Lessons Learned
- Southern Path Exit: Located at (9, 14) leading up to (9, 13).
- Ledge Pockets: Areas like (12, 14) are "traps" that require Fly to exit if entered from the North.
- Menu Mechanics: Use single button presses or "B-reset" (press B 4 times) for deep menus to avoid cursor persistence errors.
- Suicune Tracking: Overworld sightings don't register in Pokedex. Tracking is impossible until roaming starts after Tin Tower.
- Bug Catching Contest: Active today (Thursday). May affect National Park access.
