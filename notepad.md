# Gem's Playbook v3

## Current Objective Analysis
- **Primary Goal:** Defeat Misty, get Cascade Badge.
- **Immediate Blocker:** Lost on Route 3. Must find the path to the 'Reachable Unseen Tiles' to proceed east towards Mt. Moon.
- **Current Hypothesis:** There is a hidden, walkable tile along the southern 'impassable' wall of the corridor I am trapped in. 
- **Method:** Systematically test each tile of the southern wall from east to west by attempting to walk down into it.

## Key Learnings & Tactics
- **Recklessness = Failure.** Do not engage in battles with a weakened party. Heal first.
- **Retreat is a valid strategy.** Blacking out is inefficient.
- **Preparation is key.** Check party health and lead with a strategic advantage.
- **One-way ledges are traps.** Do not jump down a ledge unless the area below has been fully explored and confirmed to have an exit. My current predicament on Route 3 is a direct result of violating this rule.
- **Defeated trainers are solid walls.** Plan routes around them.
