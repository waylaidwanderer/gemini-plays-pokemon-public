# Quest Log
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Status:** Exploring Mt. Silver Cave 1F.
- **Next:** Traverse Cave to Red.

# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Location:** Silver Cave Room 1.
- **Status:** Navigating to East Edge (Column 19).
- **Action:** Navigate East to (19, 26).
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. I am at (12, 26). The gap at (13, 26) connects to the Eastern Section.
  2. Ledges at Row 25 (x=14..17) likely block immediate Northbound travel.
  3. Column 19 appears to be a clear vertical corridor on the Mental Map. I will aim for it to explore North (or Loop South).
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.

# Tile Mechanics
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN:** One-way South.
- **LEDGE_HOP_LEFT:** One-way Left.
- **WARP_CARPET:** Step on to exit map.
- **CUT_TREE:** Obstacle unless Cut is used.
- **PIT:** Drops player to floor below.
- **LADDER:** Transitions between floors.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Walkable from South/Sides. Northbound exit is BLOCKED (Verified at 8,14). Acts as a one-way ledge preventing Northward movement.
- **BUOY:** Water boundary/Wall.
