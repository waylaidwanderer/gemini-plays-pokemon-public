# Legendary Roamer Hunt Strategy
- **Overview**: Manual Ecruteak Shuffle (R37 <-> Ecruteak). Roamers move on map transitions. Transition, pace 10 steps in grass, repeat.
- **Session 2 Start**: Turn 44880 (2026-01-12 21:30).
- **Session Limit**: 25 transitions. Current: 22. Will reposition if no encounter by then.
- **Lead**: ICARUS (Lv 19 Pidgeotto). Correct for R37 (Wild Lv 13-16) to filter for Roamers (Lv 40) using Repel Trick.
- **Repel Status**: Active (Turn 44936). ~170 steps remaining. (Inventory: 71 Super Repels).
- **Roamer Status**: Raikou/Entei roaming. NOT YET ENCOUNTERED.
- **Catching Strategy**: Master Ball immediately upon first encounter.

# Lessons Learned
- **Roamers**: Do NOT appear on Pokegear map until first encounter.
- **Repel Logic**: ICARUS (Lv 19) is perfect for Route 37 to filter for Roamers.
- **Tool Hygiene**: Move to the target tile in one turn and initiate the tool in the next. Do not chain press_buttons with grass_pacer.
- **Menu Persistence**: Main menu and pack cursor positions are persistent.
- **Phone Calls**: Scripted phone calls interrupt menu sequences and tools.
