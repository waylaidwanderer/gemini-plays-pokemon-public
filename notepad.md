# Dept Store Basement Strategy

## Puzzle Mechanics
- **Goal:** Reach East side (Items/Ladder).
- **Hypothesis:** NPC Facing Direction triggers the gates (Boxes).
    - NPC 5 (Middle) -> Controls Row 11/12 Gates?
    - NPC 6 (Top Left) -> Controls Top Gates?
- **Rule:** Stunned NPCs do NOT change facing direction during dialogue. Must Unstun before talking.

## Basement Puzzle Strategy
- **Goal:** Reach East side.
- **Hypothesis:** NPC 5's Facing Direction determines the Box State.
    - **Observation:**
        - NPC 5 at (9, 11) Facing DOWN -> Bottom Gates (Row 12) are CLOSED.
        - Top Gates (Row 8) are CLOSED.
    - **Test:** Talk to NPC 5 from (9, 10) to make him Face UP.
        - Check if Bottom Gates (Visible) open.
- **Plan:**
    1. **Interact:** Talk to NPC 5. He turns UP.
    2. **Observe:** Check Bottom Gates (Row 12) while text is open.
    3. **Lock:** If Open, close text and Stun immediately.
    4. **Execute:** Run through.
- **Status:**
    - Player at (8, 6).
    - NPC 5 is off-screen (likely at 9, 11).
    - Boxes at Top (8/9) are Closed.
    - Action: Moving back to (8, 7) to observe.

## Status
- Player moving to (8, 10).
- NPC 5 patrolling (9, 10) <-> (9, 11).
- Plan: Intercept NPC 5 at (9, 10) from (8, 10).
## Reflection (Turn 12312)
- **Time:** Start of specific trap attempt.
- **Hygiene:** Verified map markers and notepad.
- **Status:** Player at (8, 9) facing Right. NPC 5 at (9, 9).
- **Plan:** Press A to turn NPC 5 Left. Then Stun. Then Move.
- **Root Cause Check:** If this "turn him left" strategy fails to open gates, the "Facing Direction" hypothesis might be incomplete (e.g., maybe purely position based, or there's a switch I missed). But evidence points to vision cones.

# Tile Mechanics
- **WALL:** Impassable.
- **FLOOR:** Walkable.
- **WARP_CARPET_UP:** Walkable, triggers warp when stepping OFF the map.
- **LADDER:** Interactable/Walkable, triggers warp.
