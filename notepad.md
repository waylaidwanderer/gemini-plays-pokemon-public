# General Lessons
- Roamer vs. Scripted: Suicune is NOT a roamer in Crystal. Don't rely on Pokedex 'Area' for movement; it only indicates the current route of the scripted event.
- Pokedex Hallucination: Be cautious of interpreting the Pokedex AREA map; it does not provide coordinate-level data or 'Nest' markers. (Turn 17041)
- Surf Initiation: Directional buttons won't enter water. Must face water and press A.
