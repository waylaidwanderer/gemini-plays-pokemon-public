# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
- **Quest Start:** Turn 49885
- **Status:** Committing to the Western Highway (X=2) via the Row 46 Bypass.

## The Plan: The Great Bypass
The northern plateau (14, 10) is a fortress of ledges. The only entry is from the west at Row 10.
1. Clear the NPC: Move around Pokefan M at (16, 33). (In Progress)
2. Southern Pivot: Reach (12, 47) to clear the central Gym walls.
3. Terrace Entry: Reach (6, 47).
4. Mechanical Bypass: Move North through (6, 46) [UP_WALL]. This bypasses the elevation trap.
5. Coastal Highway: Reach (2, 46).
6. The Dash: Walk North along X=2 to Row 10.
7. Victory: Walk East to (14, 10) and trigger Suicune.

## Verified Mechanics
- Row 46/47: (6, 46) is a UP_WALL. Moving Up from (6, 47) is allowed. Moving Down from (6, 46) is blocked.
- X=2 Highway: Clear land path from Row 46 to Row 10.
- Row 10: Clear land path from X=2 to X=15.

## Battle Plan: Eusine
- Roster: Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25).
- Lead: Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion). Strategy: Flamethrower.

## Failed Hypotheses
- Hypothesis 1: Land access via X=11 (blocked by Row 31 wall).
- Hypothesis 2: Direct Surf to beach (dead end).
- Hypothesis 3: Cut tree at (11, 13) (fake tree).
- Hypothesis 4: Southern loop via Row 51 (blocked by elevation traps).
- Hypothesis 5: Western bypass via X=2 from the north (blocked by Row 15 ledge).
