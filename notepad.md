# Game Mechanics & Systems
## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR / TALL_GRASS: Walkable.
- WALL / COUNTER / FLOOR_UP_WALL (from North): Impassable.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN (⤵️): One-way jump North to South.
- NPCs: Impassable walls (even after defeat).
- Blackthorn Elevation: Tiered city. Gaps in ledges allow Northward walking (e.g., 13,17; 9,21; 13,23).
- Pits (Blackthorn Gym): One-way warp to same coords on floor below. Hypothesis: Filling pits on 2F bridges paths on 1F.
- Ladders (Blackthorn Gym): Two-way warp between floors. Usually triggers by stepping ON, but may require 'A' press.

# Pokemon & Party Information

- Method: Kimchi holds Exp. Share. Lead Xenon.

## Strategy for Gym Leader Clair
- Clair's Team: Dragonair x3 (Lv37), Kingdra (Lv40).
- Tactical Plan:
  - Lead Calcifer (Typhlosion, Lv49): Use Return (max happiness) or Thunderpunch for consistent neutral damage. Level advantage is key.

- Verified Pits (2F): (2, 5), (8, 3), (8, 7).
- Current Boulder Positions: Boulder 6 (3, 3), Boulder 7 (6, 1), Boulder 8 (8, 14).
- Strategy: Solve boulders manually. B7 (6, 1) -> Pit (8, 3). B6 (3, 3) -> Pit (2, 5). B8 (8, 14) -> Pit (8, 7).
- Boulder 7 (6, 1) Path: From (5, 1), push Right (to 7, 1), then Down (to 7, 2), then move to (7, 2) and push Right (to 8, 2), then move to (8, 1) and push Down (to 8, 3).
