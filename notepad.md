# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The Northern Water Loop (Verified)
- Plan:
  1. Surf East to (27, 14). [IN PROGRESS]
  2. Surf North to (27, 8).
  3. Surf West to (22, 8) [Gap], then to (18, 8).
  4. Navigate to the northern plateau landing spot at (16, 11).
  5. Walk to (14, 10).
- Status: At (23, 14) surfing, heading East.
- Reasoning: Row 9 and Column 22 are solid buoy barriers. The only way to the west side of the maze is to loop through the main channel at X=27 and use the northern gap at (22, 8).
