# Suicune Capture Strategy
## The Repel Trick
- Lead: KIMCHI (Lv 21 Gloom).
- Method: Super Repel filters wild Pokemon (Lv 13-16). Suicune (Lv 40) is the only possible encounter.
- Inventory: Super Repel x6 (Item 15 in PACK).
- Confirmed PACK Order:
  1. PSNCUREBERRY, 2. X ATTACK, 3. BITTER BERRY, 4. ICE BERRY, 5. MAX ETHER, 6. FULL HEAL, 7. ICE HEAL, 8. X SPECIAL, 9. GUARD SPEC., 10. LEMONADE, 11. FRESH WATER, 12. SUPER POTION, 13. AMULET COIN, 14. REVIVE, 15. SUPER REPEL

## Battle Strategy (vs Suicune Lv 40)
- Mechanics: Suicune (Base Speed 85) flees on its first turn. KIMCHI (Base Speed 40) is slower.
- Flee Logic: Roamers flee on their first active turn if not asleep or trapped.
- Strategy: Chipping HP and inflicting status (Sleep) is persistent across encounters. Use Sleep Powder every encounter.
- Catch Rate: ~0.39% (Full HP, Great Ball). Increases significantly (~4.3%) when asleep.
- Contingency: If progress stalls (5 encounters), catch a faster trapper (e.g., Haunter for Mean Look).

## Route 38 Navigation
- Roamer Logic: Suicune moves routes ONLY when crossing map boundaries (Route 38/39 edge), using Fly, or after a battle.
- Boundary: Route 38 (0, 10) <-> Route 39 (19, 10).
