# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Stop Team Rocket.
- **Secondary Goal:** Fly to Goldenrod City.
- **Next Task:** Investigate Radio Tower (Team Rocket takeover).

## Action Log
- **Status:** In Goldenrod Underground Entrance (North).
- **Correction:** This building (9, 5) is the Underground Entrance, NOT the Radio Tower.
- **Plan:** Exit back to Goldenrod and head East/North to find the real Radio Tower.
- **Hypothesis:** The Radio Tower is the large dark building to the East of here (likely the door at 15, 7 or 29, 5).

## Tile Mechanics
- **ICE:** Stepping onto this tile forces the player to slide in the current direction until they hit a WALL, OBJECT, or FLOOR tile. **Confirmed: Sliding stops on FLOOR tiles.**
- **FLOOR:** Safe to walk/stop.
- **Trap Tiles:** B1F corridors (Geodude/Voltorb/Koffing) - *Rocket Hideout*.
- **Security Cameras:** Trigger alarms/battles - *Rocket Hideout*.
