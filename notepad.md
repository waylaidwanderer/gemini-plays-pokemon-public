# Quest Log
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Status:** Traversing Victory Road backwards.
- **Next:** Reach South Exit of Victory Road -> Reception Gate -> West -> Mt. Silver.

# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Location:** Victory Road (3F).
- **Status:** Traversing North section (Dead End on 3F).
- **Action:** Retrying Ladder at (13, 17) to 2F.
- **Reasoning:** 3F North is a dead end. The path forward must be on 2F, despite previous log claiming it was a dead end. I likely missed something on 2F.
- **Goal:** Explore 2F from Ladder (13, 17).

- **LADDER:** Transitions between floors.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Acts as a wall when approaching from above (North).
- **BUOY:** Water boundary/Wall.

# Reflection (Turn 25045)
- **Status:** Traversing Victory Road backwards to reach Mt. Silver.
