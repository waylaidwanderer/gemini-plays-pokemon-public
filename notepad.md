# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Reach the Dragon Shrine via the East Whirlpool.

# Current Status (Turn 18304)
- **Location:** Dragon's Den B1F (25, 22).
- **Facing:** Down (Towards Whirlpool at 25, 23).
- **Action:** Moved to adjacent whirlpool tile to test interaction.
- **Hypothesis:** Specific tile (24, 23) might be problematic, or Lapis not being lead is an issue.
- **Next Step:** If direct interaction fails, swap Lapis to Slot 1.

# Plan
1. Interact with Whirlpool at (25, 23).
2. If fails, Switch Lapis to Lead.
3. Try Whirlpool again.
4. Navigate South to Dragon Shrine.

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Barrier requiring HM06. Can be removed.
- **Cage Layout:** Player seems confined in an area (x=24-26, y=20-23) bounded by walls and buoys/whirlpools. Escaping requires clearing a whirlpool.

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Requires HM06 Whirlpool + Glacier Badge. 
- **Lava/Magma:** (None here).
- **Ice:** (None here).

# Lessons
- **Menu Navigation:** Always verify cursor position before committing to a sequence. Blind input leads to wrong menus (e.g., PACK instead of POKEMON).
