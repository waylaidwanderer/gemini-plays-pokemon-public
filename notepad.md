# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The West Beach Land Route (Exploration Phase)
- Plan:
  1. Walk to (6, 35) to test the ledge at (6, 34). [IN PROGRESS]
  2. Walk West through Row 35 to reach the beach at X=2.
  3. Walk North along X=2 to Row 10.
  4. Walk East to trigger sighting.
- Status: At (6, 31), testing Row 34/35 access.
- Reasoning: Direct West access at Row 31 is blocked by a wall at (5, 31). Row 35 appears to be a clear corridor to the West Beach.
