## Strategy: Terrestrial Zig-Zag to Suicune
**Start Turn:** 48900 (Quest: Trigger Suicune Overworld Sighting)

Cianwood's internal walls are bypassed by specific gaps. Ledges (FLOOR_UP_WALL) block DOWN movement but allow UP and East-West movement.

### Step-by-Step Execution Plan
1. Close menu and walk to (12, 32). <- CURRENT TASK
2. Walk South to (12, 44), then West to (8, 44) (Gap in X=9 wall).
3. Walk South to (8, 48), then West to (6, 48) (Gap in X=7 wall).
4. Walk North to (6, 35), then West to (2, 35) (Gap in X=5 wall).
5. Walk North along the West Beach Highway (X=2) to (2, 14).
6. Walk East along Row 14 to (8, 14), then North to (8, 10).
7. Walk East to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune sighting.

## Tile Mechanics: Cianwood City
- FLOOR: Standard traversable ground.
- WALL: Impassable barrier.
- WATER: Surf required.
- BUOY: Impassable water barrier.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way barrier. Blocks DOWN movement. Allows UP and East-West movement. (Verified at (6, 46)).

## Navigation: Internal Gaps
- X=9 Wall Gap: Row 44-47.
- X=7 Wall Gap: Row 48-51.
- X=5 Wall Gap: Row 34-37.

## Failed Hypotheses & Lessons
- Great Sea Bypass: Route 40 is a dead end on the West.
- Row 8 Bypass: Blocked by BUOY at (26, 8).
- Inner Channel South: Blocked at Row 15 by a solid buoy line.

## Inventory Check
- Super Repel: 5 remaining. Last applied turn 49278. (~150 steps remaining).
- Party: Calcifer (Lv 64) leads. Ready for Eusine.
