- Objective: Walk on the trigger tile for the overworld Suicune event.
- Search Start: Turn 19082.
- Reachable Tiles: (20, 10-11), (21, 10-11), (22, 10-12), (23, 10-12), (24, 10-14), (25, 10-12, 14-15), (26, 10-12, 14-17), (27, 10-12, 14-15, 17), (28, 10-12, 15, 17), (29, 10-11, 15, 17), (30, 10-11, 15-17).
- Note: Apricorn trees were picked; their disappearance is not the trigger.

# Battle Prep & Funding
- Target: Suicune (Lv40).
- Strategy: Lead XENON (Gastly Lv21) for Hypnosis. Weaken with GNEISS (Lv44).
- Resources: 1 Ultra Ball, 23 Great Balls. Need ~¥12,000 for 10+ Ultra Balls.
- Plan: 
    1. Sell Fire/Water Stones at Ecruteak Mart (¥2100).
    2. Defeat remaining trainers on Route 42/44.

# Tile Mechanics
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN/RIGHT: One-way movement.
- HEADBUTT_TREE/CUT_TREE: Impassable; Cut removes Cut Trees.
- COUNTER: Interact from adjacent tile.

# Lessons Learned
- Pokedex scrolling is sensitive; verify selection before clicking 'AREA'.
- Map transitions move roaming Pokemon, but Suicune (Step 3) is a stationary overworld trigger.
