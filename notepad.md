# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) in Cianwood City to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The West Beach Land Route (Verified)
- Plan:
  1. Use Super Repel. [DONE]
  2. Walk to (2, 37) via Row 38 (Gap at (5, 37)). [IN PROGRESS]
  3. Walk North along West Beach (X=2) to (2, 12).
  4. Walk East along Row 12 to (14, 12).
  5. Walk North to (14, 10).
- Status: At (27, 44) on land, exiting SURF menu.
- Reasoning: Row 15 is a solid barrier from X=3 to X=17. X=0,1,2 (West Beach) is the only land path North. Row 37 has a gap at (5, 37) to reach the beach from the central city. Row 12 is a horizontal artery that provides access to the sighting spot.

# Blocked Routes (Verified)
- Central City: Vertical walls at X=5, X=9, X=11, X=17.
- Row 15 Barrier: Solid wall/ledge from X=3 to X=17.
- Row 30/34/46 Barriers: Impassable cliffs (FLOOR_UP_WALL).

# Tile Mechanics (Verified)

- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Surf required. Traversable.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable cliff face.
