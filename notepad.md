# Johto Journey: Gem's Log

## Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Traversable ground. Standard movement tile.
- WALL / FLOOR_UP_WALL / WATER / ROCK: Impassable. Cannot walk through these.
- TALL_GRASS: Wild encounters. Found on Route 31 and Route 32.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way South. Can jump down but not back up.
- COUNTER: STAND in front to talk to NPCs (like Nurse Joy or Mart Clerks).
- WARP_CARPET / LADDER / DOOR / CAVE: Transitions to other maps or areas.
- PC / BOOKSHELF / RADIO / SIGN: Interactable objects providing info or service.

## Gym Progress
- Zephyr Badge: Obtained from Gym Leader Falkner in Violet City. Allows use of Flash.

## Union Cave 1F Progress
- Explored eastern passage. Found Great Ball at (17, 21).
- Firebreather Bill (14, 19) defeated.
- Found Potion at (4, 17).
- Ladder at (5, 19) and Super Nerd at (4, 21) marked.
- Hypothesis: FLOOR_UP_WALL tiles are ledges (One-way South).

## Lessons Learned
- Menu Navigation: The main menu wraps around (8 items). Use 8 Downs to hit EXIT as a known anchor.
- Battle Lead: Switching in battle updates overworld lead upon victory/escape.
- Tile Mechanics: FLOOR_UP_WALL appears to be the collision type for ledges in this cave.

## Strategy: Reaching Azalea Town
- Lead with Calcifer (Quilava) to handle cave encounters.
- Navigate south through Union Cave 1F to find the exit to Route 33.
- Azalea Town is the next destination for the second Gym Badge.

## Battle Notes

- Calcifer (Quilava): Lv16. Primary attacker. Knows Ember and Smokescreen.
