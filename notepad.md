# Mechanics & State
- **Fly Mechanics:** Blocked on door mats (29,4) AND (29,5).
- **Movement:** Moved to (30, 5). Should be safe.
- **Menu:** Cursor on Pokemon -> Mistral (Slot 6).
- **Map Navigation:** Cherrygrove -> Violet -> Ecruteak.

# Strategy
1. Execute Blind Fly Sequence (High Confidence).
2. Sequence: Start -> A (Pokemon) -> A (Mistral) -> A (Fly) -> Map: Up, Left -> A.

# Reflection
- **Confidence:** Last menu interaction was "Select Mistral -> Fly -> Fail -> Exit". Cursor should remain on Pokemon and Mistral.
- **Risk:** If cursor moved, I might open Pack or Save. Will monitor result.
