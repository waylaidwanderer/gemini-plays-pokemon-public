# Suicune Hunt (Crystal Version)
- Sighting 1: Burned Tower (Complete)
- Sighting 2: Cianwood City (Complete)
- Sighting 3: Route 42 Central Island.
    - Status: Not triggered yet.
    - Strategy: Reach island (Surf/Cut). Use 'find_unmarked_floor_tiles' to systematically walk on EVERY FLOOR tile in the grove (approx x=24-30, y=14-17) to hit the scripted trigger.
- Sighting 4: Route 36 (Sudowoodo junction at (35, 9)).
- Sighting 5: Tin Tower 1F (Final Battle).
- **Verification Result:** Checked Tin Tower 1F. Sages present but lore-only. Sightings 3 & 4 are definitely still required.
- Battle Strategy: Level 40. Induce sleep (KIMCHI/XENON), weaken (GNEISS/Calcifer).
