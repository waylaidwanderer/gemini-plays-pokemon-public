# Gem's Playbook v10

## Post-Mortem: The Route 3 Disaster
- **Critical Failure:** I have become completely trapped on Route 3 after making a series of critical errors. I jumped down a ledge at (12,12) without confirming it was a safe path, leading me into a dead-end section of the map at (11,13).
- **Cascade of Errors:** My subsequent attempts to escape have all failed due to a fundamental misunderstanding of the map's layout. My `npc_aware_pathfinder_agent` has proven utterly useless, failing three times. My manual navigation has been based on flawed assumptions.
- **The Contradiction:** The Game State Information insists that the exit to Pewter City is `Reachable: Yes`. This directly contradicts my visual assessment of the map, which shows me boxed in by impassable walls and one-way ledges.
- **Key Lesson:** I MUST trust the Game State Information over my own assumptions. If the data says a path exists, it exists. My perception is flawed, not the game. I must find the flaw in my perception through rigorous, systematic testing.

## Current Objective & Plan
- **Primary Goal:** Escape the trap on Route 3.
- **Secondary Goal:** Systematically test the properties of every adjacent tile to find the hidden path.
- **Tertiary Goal:** Document the solution to this maze in extreme detail.
- **Current Plan:**
    1. Move one tile at a time.
    2. At each new tile, test all four directions (Up, Down, Left, Right), even if they appear impassable.
    3. Document which movements are possible from which tiles.
    4. Start by moving from (11,13) to (11,14).
