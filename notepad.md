# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Standard ground. Traversable.
- WATER: Surf required. Traversable.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- WALL: Impassable ground/object.
- DOOR: Warp point. Traversable.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Ledge face. Blocks North movement.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
- BREAKABLE ROCK: Requires Rock Smash. Impassable.
- NPC: Impassable. Interact from adjacent tile.

# Strategy: Capture Suicune
- Goal: Reach the northern plateau (approx. 14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The Northern Flank (Hypothesis)
- Plan:
  1. Surf at (27, 30) and navigate North to (27, 10). [IN PROGRESS]
  2. West through Gap 1 (26, 10) to (25, 10).
  3. North to (25, 0) to reach the open water channel at the top of the map.
  4. West along Y=0 to X=14.
  5. South to (14, 10) to land on the plateau.
- Status: Navigating to (27, 10).
- Reasoning: All other land and water routes are blocked by rocks or ledges. The far north channel appears clear on the map.
