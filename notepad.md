# Reflection (Turn 24561)
- **Execution:** Addressed unmarked warps at (17, 7) and (18, 7) leading to Route 22.

- **Map:** Marking warps at (17, 7) and (18, 7).
- **Lessons:** Gatehouse layout is crucial. Row 17 = South (Route 26). Row 7 (East side) = East (Route 22). Always verify compass direction.
