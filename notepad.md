# Gem's Strategic Plan & Learnings

## Current Plan
1. Defeat the Jr. Trainer in the Pewter Gym.
2. Challenge and defeat Brock to earn the Boulder Badge.

## Key Learnings & Reflections
*   **Test Assumptions, Pivot Quickly:** My search for the Old Amber in the museum was a failure based on an unverified assumption. I must test hypotheses faster and abandon them if they don't yield results. (Failed Hypothesis: Old Amber is in the main museum area. Attempts: 1, Result: Failure).
*   **Tool-First Navigation:** My manual navigation is inefficient and prone to error. I must default to using my `pathfinding_agent` for all non-trivial movement. The agent is still not 100% reliable, but it's better than getting stuck repeatedly.
*   **Address Party Imbalance:** There's a significant level gap in my party. I need to actively train THISTLE (Lvl 4) and KITSUNE (Lvl 7) to ensure they are viable for future challenges.

### World Clues
*   A Gentleman in the Pewter City Pok√©mon Center mentioned that **Team Rocket is at Mt. Moon**.
*   The eastern route out of Pewter is blocked due to Team Rocket's activities at Mt. Moon.
*   The Moon Stone exhibit mentioned the stone comes from **Mt. Moon**.
