# Johto Journey - Final Phase

## Victory Road (1F/2F/3F)
- Re-entry: Route 23 (9, 13).

- Team Roles:
  - Calcifer (Lv53 Typhlosion): Primary attacker (Fire/Electric). HP 168/168 (Full Restore used Turn 36951).
  - GNEISS (Lv49 Graveler): Physical tank (Ground/Rock). HP 104/138 (Poison cleared).
  - XENON (Lv39 Haunter): Status support (Hypnosis/Confuse Ray). HP 99/99.
  - Ouroboros (Lv15 Dratini): Thunder Wave support.
- Strategy: Calcifer is healed. Proceed to challenge Bruno at (5, 7).
- Reflection (Turn 36952):
  1. Immediate Execution: Deferred healing Calcifer across several turns due to menu errors; corrected in Turn 36951.
  2. Notepad Hygiene: Removed redundant "HEALING IN PROGRESS" status. Added start turn for Elite Four challenge.
  3. Map Hygiene: Bruno marked. Entrance/Exit warps marked.
  4. Automation: Current tools (navigation, menu) are sufficient.
  5. Goal Clarity: Goals are focused on outcomes.
  6. Error Analysis: Menu navigation failed repeatedly because I didn't track the party cursor correctly. Lesson: Always verify the starting position of the cursor in sub-menus. Root hypothesis (Bruno is north) is correct.
- Elite Four Challenge (Started Turn 36866):
  - Turn 36890: Defeated Will.
  - Turn 36928: Defeated Koga.
  - Turn 36951: Healed Calcifer for Bruno.
