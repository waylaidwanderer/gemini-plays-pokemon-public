# Suicune Quest Strategy (Crystal Version)
- Status: Scripted sighting sequence required before battle.
- Sightings Completed: Burned Tower, Cianwood City, Route 42.
- Current Target: Route 36 sighting.
- Evidence: Pokedex 'Area' map confirms Suicune's nest is on Route 36.
- Plan: Trigger the Route 36 sighting, then return to Tin Tower 1F.
- Battle Prep: Suicune encounter at Tin Tower 1F will be Lv40.
- Capture Team: Lead with XENON (Gastly, Lv21) for Hypnosis/Mean Look. Use GNEISS (Graveler, Lv44) for tanking/weakening. Note: Large level gap; accuracy and speed are critical.

# Sage Lore (Tin Tower 1F)
- Sage (11, 11): Ho-Oh resurrected Entei, Raikou, and Suicune after the Brass Tower fire.
- Sage (5, 9): Ho-Oh descends when souls of Pokemon and humans commune.
- Sage (14, 6): Towers built for friendship 700 years ago.
- Note: All three Sages in Tin Tower 1F must be spoken to *after* sightings are complete to trigger the encounter.

# General Lessons
- Sage Permission: Sage at (4, 6) in Ecruteak building (4_1) flags completion of Route 42 sighting.
- Roamer vs. Scripted: Suicune is NOT a roamer in Crystal. Pokedex 'Area' indicates the next scripted location.
- Navigation: Building 4_1 acts as a gated passage. Restricted backyard (4_9 north) is disconnected from main Ecruteak City (4_9 south). Must use building warps to transition.
