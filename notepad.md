### Objectives
1. **Primary**: Go to Route 34 (South).
2. **Secondary**: Get SquirtBottle.
3. **Tertiary**: Find Route 35 Gatehouse (North).

### Navigation Notes (Goldenrod)
- **North Exit Puzzle**: The path to Route 35 is blocked by complex walls.
  - **Center (Flower Shop)**: Blocked at Row 1.
  - **West (Radio Tower)**: Dead end.
  - **East (Gym)**: Blocked at Row 6-19.
  - **Far East**: Need to find a crossover point. Row 5 looks promising but access is tricky.
- **Strategy**: Exiting South to Route 34 first.

### Key Locations
- **Flower Shop**: (19, 1). Needs Sudowoodo interaction.
- **Route 34 Exit**: South edge of map (Row 35).

### Quests
- **Route 35 Gatehouse**: Deliver Mail (Randy).

### Status
- Badges: 3 (Zephyr, Hive, Plain).
- Party: Quilava (26), Sentret (2), Bellsprout (6), Togepi (5), Rattata (8).
- Route 34 Navigation: To reach the Daycare, travel North along the West path (main road) and enter the yard through the gap in the fence at (11, 15). Watch out for the Officer at (10, 16).
- Navigation Target: North Exit of Goldenrod (approx 24, 0).
- Pathing: The city layout is complex. Row 4 is a major barrier. The only valid path North seems to be on the far East side.

  2. Navigate to x=32/33 (use Row 7 or 10 to bypass walls).
  3. Go North to Row 3.
  4. Go West along Row 3 to x=23-26.
  5. Go North to the Exit.
- Received Odd Egg (Turn 7045). Contains unknown Pokemon (fingers crossed for a shiny!).
