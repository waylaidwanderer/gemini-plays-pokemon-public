  1. Defeat Eusine in Cianwood City.

# Cianwood Gym Strategy (Leader Chuck)
- Type: Fighting.
- Weaknesses: Flying, Psychic.
- My Team Analysis:
  - Calcifer (QUILAVA): Main attacker. Flame Wheel is strong.
  - GNEISS (GRAVELER): Weak to Fighting. Use only if necessary.
  - KIMCHI (ODDISH): Poison typing helps resist Fighting, but Grass is neutral.
- Plan: Train Calcifer. Consider catching a Flying type (e.g., Pidgeotto) if available.
