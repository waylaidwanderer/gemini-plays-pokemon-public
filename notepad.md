# Current Location
*   **Current Location:** Mt Moon 1F (ID: 59) at (24,16) - In battle.

# Current Goals (Revised Turn 7851)
*   **Primary Goal:** Reach Cerulean City and train key team members to Lv20-21 to challenge Gym Leader Misty (Ace Starmie Lv21, Player Cap 21).
*   **Secondary Goal:** Secure one of the two Fossils (Dome or Helix) on Mt. Moon B2F.
*   **Tertiary Goal:** After obtaining a fossil, give it to the Super Nerd on Mt. Moon B2F to open the path towards the eastern Mt. Moon exit.

# Gameplay Notes & Strategy
## Navigation & Exploration
*   **CRITICAL:** Trust the **annotated screen** for immediate obstacles over map memory if there's a conflict.
*   The North map connection from Route 3 leads to the *lowest tier* of 'Route 4 (Before Mt. Moon)', forming a loop for upper Route 4/western Mt. Moon access.
*   When on Route 4 (Before Mt. Moon) upper tiers, navigate eastward by descending ledges.
*   The Super Nerd at Mt. Moon B2F (30,12) requests a fossil; he does not provide one.
*   **Path Validation (CRITICAL):** Rigorously verify paths generated by `dungeon_navigator_agent`, especially in complex, warp-heavy environments like Mt. Moon, by cross-referencing with map data or using manual checks for initial segments. Reduce reliance.
*   **Path Accessibility:** Re-evaluate critical path accessibility periodically, as game states can change (e.g., B1F (14,28) warp became reachable).
*   **Multi-Tile Warps:** Be consistently aware of 2-step activation (onto tile, then into boundary/direction).
*   **Mt. Moon Fossil Hunt Plan (Post-Healing, Revised Turn 7844):**
    1.  Navigate from Mt. Moon 1F to Mt. Moon B1F (current step).
    2.  The warp at B1F (14,28) leading to the fossil area of B2F is `reachable: yes`. Proceed to B1F (14,28) and take this warp.
    3.  Secure a Fossil on B2F (likely near defeated Rocket Grunt at B2F (16,23)).
    4.  Return the fossil to the Super Nerd at (30,12) on B2F (in the other B2F segment).

## Battle Strategy
*   Improve precision in battle menu navigation.
*   Be mindful of type matchups and PP conservation. Internalize ROM hack type changes.
*   **Risk Assessment:** Avoid switching in Pokémon with critically low HP against opponents that can KO them.
*   **Healing Priority:** Prioritize reaching a Pokémon Center quickly if key Pokémon are critically injured.

## ROM Hack Specifics
*   **General Changes:** Old Rod (Viridian Mart), HMs forgettable/menu use, TMs repurchasable, Trade evos by level.
*   **Type Matchup Changes (CRITICAL TO MEMORIZE):** Ghost (Special) SE vs Psychic. Bug no longer SE vs Poison. Grass is 0.25x vs Poison/Flying (e.g., Zubat). Poison attacks NVE vs Zubat (Poison/Flying).
*   **Stat Boosts:** Pikachu, Farfetch’d, Venomoth, Onix.
*   **Level Caps:** Misty (Starmie Lv21 -> Cap 21), Lt. Surge (Raichu Lv28 -> Player Cap 24).

## PC Interaction Notes
*   Pewter City PC is on the far right (east side) of the Pokecenter.
*   'SOMEONE's PC' for Pokémon Storage. 'Gem's PC' for Item Storage.

# Agent Development & Usage (Revised Turn 7851)
*   **Current Agents (10/10):** `level_up_move_advisor_agent`, `next_battle_action_advisor_agent`, `item_finder_reminder_agent`, `tm_learning_advisor_agent`, `rom_hack_mechanics_lookup_agent`, `dungeon_navigator_agent`, `team_composition_advisor_agent`, `local_area_analyzer_agent`, `item_use_advisor_agent`, `trainer_data_logger_agent`.
*   **High Usage Agents to Monitor & Reduce Reliance:**
    *   `dungeon_navigator_agent` (83 uses): REDUCE RELIANCE. Prioritize manual navigation or segment/verify agent paths, especially in warp-heavy areas.
    *   `next_battle_action_advisor_agent` (20 uses): Continue efforts for more manual battle decisions, especially for common wild Pokémon.
*   **Low Usage Agents (Evaluate Utility/Replacement):**
    *   `rom_hack_mechanics_lookup_agent` (1 use): Keep for now, useful for quick checks.
    *   `team_composition_advisor_agent` (1 use): Plan to use before major fights. Keep.
    *   `local_area_analyzer_agent` (1 use): Highly situational. Candidate for deletion if a better agent idea proves more valuable.
    *   `item_use_advisor_agent` (1 use): Test further with Moon Stone/Rare Candy as planned.
    *   `trainer_data_logger_agent` (1 use): Keep for now.
*   **Agent Ideas (For Future Consideration if Slot Opens):**
    *   `training_regimen_planner_agent`: Suggest optimal training order/locations. (Evaluate post-Misty).
    *   `rare_candy_optimizer_agent`: Specialized version of `item_use_advisor_agent` for Rare Candies. (Consider if `item_use_advisor` isn't sufficient).
    *   `gym_leader_strategist_agent`: Full battle plan for Gym Leaders. (High potential value).
    *   `boulder_puzzle_solver_agent`: For complex boulder puzzles (highly situational).
*   **Agent Slot Management:** 10/10 agents defined. Be mindful of the limit. Consider deleting less useful agents if new ones are needed. Prioritize `gym_leader_strategist_agent` if a slot opens.

# Navigation Rules & Insights
*   NPCs on `navigable: false` tiles are impassable physical obstacles, even if defeated or non-battling.
*   Ledge tiles marked `navigable="true"` can be occupied (e.g., by jumping down onto them), but upward movement onto a ledge from below is prevented by game physics, even if the tile's `navigable` attribute is true. The game's movement denial takes precedence over the XML's `navigable` flag for directional traversal of ledges from below.
*   Defeated trainers may sometimes remain as physical obstacles on their tile; their tile will remain `navigable: false` in map memory.

# Battle Mechanics Update (Mt. Moon):
*   Confirmed Acid (Poison-type move) is 'not very effective' (0.5x) against wild Zubat (Poison/Flying). This indicates a ROM hack change where Poison attacks are resisted by either Poison-type or Flying-type Pokémon (or both, though less likely for 0.5x). Standard Gen 1: Poison vs Poison = 1x, Poison vs Flying = 1x.
*   Confirmed Absorb (Grass-type move) is 'not very effective' (0.25x or similar, very low damage) against wild Zubat (Poison/Flying). This implies Grass is resisted by both Poison and Flying types in this ROM hack. Standard Gen 1: Grass vs Poison = 0.5x, Grass vs Flying = 0.5x. Combined would be 0.25x.
*   Confirmed Leech Life (Bug-type) is super effective (4x) against Gloom (Grass/Poison). Standard Gen 1: Bug vs Grass = 2x, Bug vs Poison = 0.5x (Net 1x). This ROM hack must have Bug SE vs Poison, or Bug is 2x vs Grass and 2x vs Poison for a 4x total. The latter is more likely to result in 4x.
*   Confirmed Thundershock (Electric-type) is super effective (2x) against Zubat (Poison/Flying). Standard Gen 1: Electric vs Flying = 2x, Electric vs Poison = 1x.
