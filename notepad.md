# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Cure Jasmine's Ampharos (Lighthouse).
- **Secondary Goal:** Travel to Cianwood City to get the SecretPotion (Completed).
- **Immediate Plan:** Climb the ladder at (9, 5) to return to 4F Center. Then find and fall into the pit at 4F(8, 3).
- **Hypothesis:** Falling from 4F(9,3) landed on 3F(9,3) which is safe. I need to fall from 4F(8,3) to potentially crash through 3F(8,3) to 2F.
- **Quest Update:** 3F Center is a landing zone. The exit path requires a different drop from 4F.
