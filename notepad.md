# Current Location & Navigation Plan
*   **Current Location:** Mt. Moon 1F (ID: 59) at (18,13). This isolated area has no eastern exit.
*   **Navigation Plan:** Follow 'Path to Cerulean (Route 4 East) - Attempt 8'. Current step: Use ladder at 1F(18,12) -> B1F(26,10).

# Current Goals

*   **Secondary Goal:** Reach the Mt. Moon exit leading to Route 4 East.
*   **Tertiary Goal:** Heal NINA (NIDORAN♀) at the Cerulean City Pokémon Center.

# Gameplay Notes & Strategy
## Navigation & Exploration
*   North map connection from Route 3 leads to 'Route 4 (Before Mt. Moon)' lower tier (loop).
*   Route 4 (Before Mt. Moon) upper tiers: navigate eastward by descending ledges.
*   **Path Planning:** Manually plan complex paths in segments. Review screen/map memory.
*   **Item Acquisition:** Pick-up items are visible sprites in `Map Sprites` after trigger.
*   **NPC Interaction:** Max 3-4 attempts for mobile NPCs; assume non-battling/defeated if no engagement.
*   **Notepad Management:** Consolidate updates during planning phases.

## Battle Strategy
*   Precise battle menu navigation. Mind type matchups & PP. Internalize ROM hack type changes.
*   **Risk Assessment:** Avoid switching low HP Pokémon against KOs. Run if party critical (unless training overrides).
*   **Healing Priority:** Pokémon Center if key Pokémon critically injured & no immediate objective outweighs.

## ROM Hack Specifics
*   **General:** Old Rod (Viridian Mart), HMs forgettable/menu use, TMs repurchasable, Trade evos by level.
*   **Type Matchups (CRITICAL):** Ghost (Special) SE vs Psychic. Bug no longer SE vs Poison. Grass 0.25x vs Poison/Flying. Poison NVE vs Zubat. Bug SE vs Poison (likely 2x, so 4x vs Grass/Poison like Gloom).
*   **Stat Boosts:** Pikachu, Farfetch’d, Venomoth, Onix.
*   **Level Caps:** Misty (Starmie Lv21 -> Cap 21), Lt. Surge (Raichu Lv28 -> Player Cap 24).

# Path to Cerulean (Route 4 East) - Attempt 8:
The isolated 1F area (reached via B1F(26,10) ladder) is a dead end. The B2F Rocket at (30,12) is also a dead end. New plan targets a different B2F segment.
1.  Current location: Mt. Moon 1F (ID 59) at (18,13). This isolated area has no eastern exit.
2.  Use ladder at 1F(18,12) -> B1F(26,10).
3.  On B1F (ID 60), navigate from (26,10) to the warp at B1F(22,18). (This is B1F's warp #5, leading to B2F entry point 2).
4.  Use warp B1F(22,18) -> B2F (specific coordinates for entry 2 to be determined upon arrival).
5.  Explore this new B2F segment for the exit to Route 4 East or a progressive trainer battle.

# Key Learnings & Rules
*   NPCs on `navigable: false` tiles are physical obstacles; their tile remains non-navigable.
*   Ledges: Upward movement onto a ledge from below is prevented, even if `navigable="true"`.
*   Mt. Moon 1F: (8,19) is impassable, blocking south from (8,18).
*   **Segmented Dungeons:** Complex dungeons (e.g., Mt. Moon) have isolated segments per floor, accessed via specific warps. Systematically explore warps.
*   **1x1 Warps:** Step off and back on if activation is tricky (consider Pikachu).
*   **EXP at Level Cap:** Pokémon at cap (e.g., BELLA Lv21) gain NO EXP, despite message.
*   Prioritize healing if party critical. Trust game state `reachable: no`.
