# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Reach the Dragon Shrine via the East Whirlpool.

# Current Status (Turn 18282)
- **Location:** Dragon's Den B1F (24, 22).
- **Facing:** Down (South).
- **Menu State:** "Switch Pokemon" mode active.
- **Action:** Back out, Face East, Attempt to Surf.
- **Reasoning:**
  - Field moves (Surf/Whirlpool) were missing from the menu, likely because Facing South targets an obstacle (Whirlpool) while on land.
  - Facing East targets Water (25, 22). Surfing is required to enter the water and reach the whirlpools properly.
  - "Move to where?" indicates I am in the Switch menu, so I must cancel out first.
- **Plan:**
  1. Cancel/Exit Menus (`B` x4).
  2. Face East (`Right`).
  3. Interact with Water (`A`).
  4. If prompted, confirm Surf (`A`).

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Requires HM06 Whirlpool + Glacier Badge. Usage: Menu -> Pokemon -> Select Mon -> Whirlpool.
- **Lava/Magma:** (None here, but good to remember).
- **Ice:** (None here).

# Lessons
- **Menu Navigation:** Always verify cursor position before committing to a sequence. Blind input leads to wrong menus (e.g., PACK instead of POKEMON).
