### Navigation Notes
- **Location**: Goldenrod City (Central-East).
- **Goal**: Find the path North (checking x=13 corridor).
- **Current Action**: Moving East to x=13, then North.
- **Reasoning**: The West (x=2) and Far East (x=21) paths are blocked by Row 21 walls. The Center (x=9) is blocked by a tree. I am checking the gap between x=10 and x=15.
- **Hypothesis**: There might be a path or a building entrance (Department Store?) here.
