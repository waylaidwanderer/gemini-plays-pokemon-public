# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- **Quest Start:** Turn 48900 (Suicune Tracking)
- **Status:** Investigating (11, 15) gap. Repel active.

## Execution Plan (Island Hop Investigation)
1. Use Super Repel. (Turn 49411) (Done)
2. Surf North to (14, 16) and land at (13, 16). <- CURRENT TASK
3. Walk West to (11, 16) and attempt to walk North through (11, 15).
4. If successful, walk to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.
5. If blocked at (11, 15), execute Southern Bypass (Surf to Row 51).

## Strategy: Island Hop vs. Southern Bypass
I am investigating the gap at (11, 15) in the Row 15 ledge/wall line. If (11, 15) is traversable, it provides a direct path to the northern plateau. If not, the Southern Bypass around Row 51 is the only remaining option.

## Failed Hypotheses & Lessons
- Terrestrial Path (South): Blocked by multiple ledge lines.
- Terrestrial Path (West): Blocked by wall lines at X=11, 9, 5, 3.
- Inner Channel Water Path: Entirely blocked by buoy walls (Row 9, Row 25). Must use island hop.
- Island Hop Landing (13, 16): Dead end due to walls at Row 13/15.
- Narrow Channel (X=12): Blocked at Row 15 by buoy wall.

## Tile Mechanics (Global)
- **FLOOR**: Traversable ground.
- **WALL**: Impassable barrier.
- **WATER**: Requires Surf HM.
- **BUOY**: Impassable water barrier.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL**: Blocks DOWN (South) movement.
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN**: Blocks NORTH movement.
- **DOOR**: Warp entry point.

## Inventory Check
- Super Repel: 4 remaining.
- Party: Calcifer (Lv 64) leads. Ready for Eusine.

## Progress Summary
- All 16 Badges obtained.
- Elite Four/Red defeated.
- Current Focus: Suicune tracking.
