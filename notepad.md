## Strategy: West Beach Highway to Suicune
**Start Turn:** 48900 (Quest: Trigger Suicune Overworld Sighting)

Cianwood's geography is a maze of vertical walls and ledges. The 'West Beach Highway' (X=2) provides a clear path to the northern plateau.

### Step-by-Step Execution Plan
1. Walk North to Row 28 to bypass the X=5 wall gap at (5, 28).
2. Walk West to X=2 (West Beach Highway).
3. Walk North along X=2 to Row 12.
4. Walk East along Row 12 to (14, 12).
5. Walk North to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune sighting.

## Tile Mechanics: Cianwood City
- FLOOR: Standard traversable ground.
- WALL: Impassable barrier.
- WATER: Traversable only with Surf HM.
- BUOY: Impassable water barrier.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way ledge. Blocks DOWN movement (Y to Y+1). Allows UP and East-West movement. (Verified at (6, 46) and (7, 34)).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump South. Impassable from the North side.

## Failed Hypotheses & Lessons
- Route 40 Bypass: Dead end on the West.
- Inner Channel South: Blocked at Row 15 by solid buoy line.
- Row 34/46/48/50 Ledges: Block Downward movement, forcing a long detour to the North or South.

## Inventory Check
- Super Repel: 4 remaining. Applied turn 49346.
- Party: Calcifer (Lv 64) leads. Ready for Eusine.
