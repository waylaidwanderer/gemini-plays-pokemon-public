# Victory!
- **Defeated Red:** Jan 7, 2026 (Turn 26976).
- **MVP:** Muscle (Machoke) with Thunderpunch.
- **Strategy:** Sacrifice Mistral -> Muscle Clean Switch -> Thunderpunch for the win.
- **Outcome:** Received ¥15400. Red said "..." and vanished.
- **Next:** Credits? Return home?

# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Goal:** Check for credits, then continue completing the Pokedex.
- **Location:** Route 22 (Map 23_2).
- **Post-Red Status:** Team fully healed automatically.
- **Next Stop:** Viridian City -> Pallet Town.
- **Immediate Task:** Finish testing Ledge Jump at x=20, 19, 18.
- **Hypothesis:** `FLOOR_UP_WALL` at y=16 is the only exit (South). If walking fails, will try Bicycle next.
- **Trap Analysis:** Confined to x=18-37, y=14-15. North=Ledge, West=Wall, East=Wall, South=Ledge. Must jump South.
