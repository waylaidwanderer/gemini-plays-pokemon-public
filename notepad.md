# Suicune Capture Strategy
- Start Turn: 47680
- Lead: XENON (Haunter, Lv44).
- Move 1: Hypnosis (Sleep).
- Move 2: Night Shade (44 dmg). Suicune has ~120 HP. Use twice for Red health.
- Item: Ultra Balls (32).
- Note: Suicune is Water type. Calcifer (Fire) is vulnerable. GORP (Snorlax) is a good tank.

# Strategic Plans: Locate Suicune
## The Great Spiral (Intended Route)
- Entrance: Surf at (27, 44) or (19, 30).
- Channel Entrance: (27, 30).
- Maze Logic:
  1. Lane 1 (X=27-29): Sail North to (27, 10).
  2. Gap 1: Move West through (26, 10) into Lane 2.
  3. Lane 2 (X=23-25): Sail South to (23, 16).
  4. Gap 2: Move West through (22, 16) into Lane 3.
  5. Lane 3 (X=19-21): Sail South to (19, 26).
  6. Gap 3: Move West through (18, 26) into Lane 4.
  7. Lane 4 (X=17-18): Sail North to (17, 20).
  8. Gap 4: Move West through (16, 20) into Lane 5.
  9. Lane 5 (X=14-16): Sail North to (14, 10) and land.
- Objective: Reach (7, 4) on the north beach plateau.

## Failed Hypotheses
- Gem Shortcut (11, 15): Confirmed dead end. Marker 🚫 placed.
- West Beach Shortcut (X=2): City walls and ledges (Y=46, 48, 50) likely prevent land access to the north plateau. Reverting to 'Great Spiral'.
