# Johto Journey - Final Phase
- Primary Goal: Challenge the Pokémon League at Indigo Plateau [Started Turn 35416, 5:00 PM]
- Secondary Goal: Prepare team for the Elite Four.
- Badges Obtained: 8/8 (Rising Badge obtained Turn 35416).

## Strategy: Heading to the Pokémon League
- Plan:
  1. Obtain gift Dratini from Dragon Clan Elder in Dragon Shrine (Dragon's Den). [Started Turn 35538]
  2. Level XENON (Haunter) to 45+. Teach it TM33 Ice Punch. [Started Turn 35480]
     - Training: Use Route 45 or Route 27 (once accessible).
  3. Replace ICARUS (Pidgey) and Ravioli (Krabby) with high-level members (e.g., Red Gyarados, gift Dratini). [Started Turn 35480]
     - Note: Maintain HM Surf/Whirlpool/Fly utility when swapping (e.g., Gyarados/Dratini for water HMs).
  4. Evolve KIMCHI (Gloom) using a Sun or Leaf Stone. [Started Turn 35480]
     - How: Sun Stone from Bug Contest (Tue/Thu/Sat) or Leaf Stone gift from Gina on Route 34.
  5. Surf east from New Bark Town to Route 27 and reach the Pokémon League via Victory Road. [Started Turn 35480]

## Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR/CAVE: Standard traversable tile.
- WALL: Impassable boundary.
- WATER: Traversable while Surfing.
- BUOY: Impassable water barrier.
- WHIRLPOOL: Requires HM06 to cross.
- HEADBUTT_TREE: Impassable boundary.
- LADDER/STAIRS: Warp between floors/sections.
- LEDGE: One-way jump transition.
- COUNTER: Impassable. Interaction with NPC behind it possible from adjacent tile.
- WARP_CARPET: Usually map exit, but can be standard floor (e.g., Dept Store floors).

## Lessons Learned
- Dragon Shrine Entrance: Located on the south side (19, 29).
- Whirlpool Mechanics: Re-appears if you leave and re-enter the map.
- Fly: Can be used to quickly travel between cities from the Pokémon menu.
- Landing from Water: Can land on any adjacent FLOOR-type tile.
- **Move Compatibility:** Both Calcifer (Typhlosion) and XENON (Haunter) cannot learn TM33 Ice Punch in Crystal (Turn 35621).

## League Analyst Advice
- Evaluation: Team is top-heavy (Typhlosion 49, Graveler 48). Others are underleveled (Haunter 37, others <20).
- Key Threats: Will's Psychic-types (outspeed/OHKO Haunter). Lance's Dragonites (lack of Ice coverage).
- Recommendations:
  - Obtain the gift Dratini; Dragonite can learn TM33 Ice Punch to counter Lance.
  - Level XENON (Haunter) to 45+. Teach it TM24 DragonBreath.
  - Replace ICARUS (Pidgey) and Ravioli (Krabby) with high-level encounters (e.g., Red Gyarados and gift Dratini).
  - Evolve KIMCHI (Gloom) using a Sun or Leaf Stone.
  - Use Gneiss (Graveler) with Earthquake for Koga/Bruno, but avoid Bruno's Fighting-types.
- Training Goal: Level all active party members (especially Xenon) to 45+ for the Pokémon League.
- Master Ball: Obtained from Prof. Elm [Turn 35463]. Save for legendary beasts (Suicune, Raikou, Entei).

## Failed Hypotheses
- **Hypothesis:** Typhlosion can learn Ice Punch in Crystal. **Test:** Tried teaching TM33. **Conclusion:** Denied (Turn 35538). Typhlosion is incompatible with Ice Punch in Crystal.
- **Hypothesis:** Interacting with the elevator button at (3, 0) from (3, 1) facing up on 5F calls the elevator. **Test:** Pressed A at (3, 1) facing up. **Conclusion:** Confirmed (Turn 35558). The menu appeared after the press.
