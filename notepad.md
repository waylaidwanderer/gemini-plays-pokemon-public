# Gem's Playbook v3

## Current Objective Analysis
- **Primary Goal:** Defeat Misty, get Cascade Badge.
- **Immediate Blocker:** Lost on Route 3. Must find the path to the 'Reachable Unseen Tiles' to proceed east towards Mt. Moon.
- **Current Hypothesis:** There is a hidden, walkable tile along the southern 'impassable' wall of the corridor I am trapped in. 
- **Method:** Systematically test each tile of the southern wall from east to west by attempting to walk down into it.

## Key Learnings & Tactics
- **Recklessness = Failure.** Do not engage in battles with a weakened party. Heal first.
- **Retreat is a valid strategy.** Blacking out is inefficient.
- **Preparation is key.** Check party health and lead with a strategic advantage.
- **One-way ledges are traps.** Do not jump down a ledge unless the area below has been fully explored and confirmed to have an exit. My current predicament on Route 3 is a direct result of violating this rule.
- **Defeated trainers are solid walls.** Plan routes around them.

## Important NPC Dialogue
- **PEWTER CITY, Cool Trainer F (9,16):** "It's rumored that CLEFAIRYs came from the moon! They appeared after MOON STONE fell on MT.MOON."
- **PEWTER CITY, Super Nerd (26,26):** "I'm spraying REPEL to keep POKéMON out of my garden!"
- **ROUTE 3, Youngster (11, 7):** Non-battling NPC.

## Route 3 Navigation Log
- **Hypothesis:** A hidden, walkable tile exists on the southern wall of the y=14 corridor.
- **Method:** Systematically tested every tile from (23, 14) down to (11, 14) by attempting to walk south.
- **Result:** All attempts failed. Hypothesis is **false**. The southern wall is solid.

## Battle Mechanics Discoveries
- **EXP Distribution:** Only Pokémon in the party when the final opponent faints receive EXP, even if other Pokémon participated in the battle earlier (switch-training). FURYFIST did not get EXP from the Metapod fight because he was not in the active party at the moment of fainting.
