## Strategy: Terrestrial Path to Suicune
**Start Turn:** 48900 (Quest: Trigger Suicune Overworld Sighting)

The buoy maze is a trap. A clear terrestrial path exists through the city gaps.

### Step-by-Step Execution Plan
1. Close menu and walk to (12, 32). <- CURRENT TASK
2. Walk South along the X=12 corridor to (12, 44).
3. Walk West through the Row 44 gaps to (8, 44).
4. Walk North along the X=8 corridor to (8, 35).
5. Walk West through the Row 35 gap to (2, 35) (West Beach).
6. Walk North along the West Beach (X=2) to (2, 14).
7. Walk East along the Row 14 corridor to (8, 14).
8. Walk North along the X=8 corridor to (8, 10).
9. Walk East along the Row 10 corridor to (14, 10).
10. Trigger Suicune sighting.

## Tile Mechanics: Cianwood City
- FLOOR: Standard ground.
- WALL: Impassable barrier.
- WATER: Surf required.
- BUOY: Impassable water barrier.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way ledge. Blocks DOWN movement. Allows UP and East-West movement. (Verified at (6, 46)).

## Navigation: Internal Gaps
- X=9 Wall Gap: Row 44-47.
- X=7 Wall Gap: Row 48-51.
- X=5 Wall Gap: Row 34-37.
- Row 14 Corridor: Connects West Beach to the northern plateau entrance.

## Inventory Check
- Super Repel: 4 remaining. Applied turn 49346.
- Party: Calcifer (Lv 64) leads. Ready for Eusine.

## Reflection Turn 49346
- Error Analysis: Identified that the aquatic route is a buoy-blocked maze.
- Root Hypothesis Testing: Verified a 100% clear terrestrial path via Row 44 and Row 35 gaps.
- Map Hygiene: Deleted redundant marker at (26, 9).
- Automation: Ready to use refined pathfinding tool once on solid ground.
