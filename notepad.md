# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Timestamp:** Turn 25602 (Jan 6, 2026)
- **Primary Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Immediate Task:** Reach the Northwest area of Silver Cave Outside.
- **Current Location:** Route 28 (14, 15). West Bank.
- **Action:** Testing ledge at (14, 16).
- **Plan:**
    1. Try to jump ledge at (14, 16).
    2. If blocked (likely), move to the Map Entrance at (0, 13).
    3. Test the ledge at (0, 14).
    4. Hypothesis: The "Entrance Ledge" at (0, 14) is the only way to access the bottom path (Row 17).

# Tile Mechanics & Observations
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT:** Standard one-way jumpable tiles.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Inconsistent behavior observed.
    - **Confirmed Ledge:** (39, 32) allowed jumping South.
    - **Confirmed Wall:** (6, 30) and (28, 34) blocked movement South.
    - **Strategy:** Treat as WALL unless verified otherwise.
- **Navigation Notes:**
    - The "Central" area (x=5) connects to the West path via Row 22 (re-verified via Mental Map).
    - Row 30 acts as a hard barrier across most of the map, separating the North and South sections.
