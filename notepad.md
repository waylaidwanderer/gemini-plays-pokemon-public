# Gem's Pokémon Crystal Notepad

## I. Core Directives & Lessons Learned

*   **Data Integrity is Paramount:** My internal state (notepad, markers) MUST be 100% accurate. I will not defer data correction. Assumptions must be rigorously tested before being recorded as fact.
*   **Trust Automation:** My custom tools are more reliable than my manual analysis. I must prioritize using them to avoid unforced errors.
*   **Act Immediately:** I am an LLM. There is no 'later'. Tool/agent refinement and data management tasks must be performed in the current turn, overriding gameplay actions.
*   **Scientific Method:** For all puzzles, I will strictly follow: Observe -> Hypothesize -> Test -> Conclude. I will document every step and attempt to falsify my own conclusions to avoid confirmation bias.

## III. Current Investigation: Team Rocket Hideout

*   **Objective:** Find the secret Team Rocket entrance in Mahogany Town, as per Lance's instructions, and disable the radio signal.
*   **Key Discoveries:** The hideout entrance is in the Mahogany Mart. A switch at (19, 11) on B1F disables the security cameras. The floor on B1F has a hidden path of safe tiles that must be discovered by walking over them.

### Passwords
*   **Password 1:** SLOWPOKETAIL (from Rocket Girl on B3F)

## IV. Battle Discoveries & Type Chart

### Verified Type Interactions
*   **Water (Surf) vs. Gyarados (Water/Flying):** Observed as "not very effective". This contradicts standard type charts. Need to investigate further.

## V. Open Investigations

### Inventory Management Bug
*   **Observation:** All menu-based attempts to free an inventory slot (`TOSS`, `GIVE`, `DEPOSIT`) have failed, resulting in a menu loop.
*   **Primary Hypothesis:** The only way to free an inventory slot is to consume an item during a battle. **Test:** Initiate a battle and use a Potion.

### Untested Assumptions
*   **Assumption:** The B1F floor puzzle is the only way to reach the boss.
*   **Alternative Hypothesis:** The puzzle is optional, and the second password might be on B2F, or the boss door only requires one password.
*   **Future Test:** After solving the current puzzle, re-explore B2F before proceeding to the boss.

### Tile Traversal Verification
*   **Task:** Systematically test all tile types currently listed as 'Impassable' to confirm their behavior. Do not assume a tile is impassable based on its name.
