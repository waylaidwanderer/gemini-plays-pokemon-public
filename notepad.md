- Status: ROAMING (Post-Tin Tower battle).
- Current Location (Pokedex): Route 37 (Turn 19252).
- Strategy: Boundary cycling between Ecruteak City and Route 37.
- Lead: XENON (Gastly Lv21) with Mean Look and Hypnosis.

# Suicune Battle Strategy (Lv40)
- Goal: Prevent flee and capture.
- Turn 1: Use MEAN LOOK (XENON). 
- Speed Check: Suicune (Base 85, Lv40) is faster than Gastly (Base 80, Lv21).
- Problem: Suicune will likely flee before XENON can act.
- Potential Solutions:
    1. Get Quick Claw (Hypothesis: House on Route 35/36).
    2. Level up XENON significantly.
    3. Use a faster Pokemon with a trapping move or sleep.
- Efficiency: Use SUPER REPEL with XENON (Lv21) leading to filter out low-level encounters (Lv13-16) and target Suicune (Lv40).
- Turn 2+: Use HYPNOSIS.
- Turn 3+: Chip damage with NIGHT SHADE (fixed damage = level).
