# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Standard ground. Traversable.
- WATER: Surf required. Traversable.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- WALL: Impassable.
- DOOR: Warp point.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable cliff face. Blocks movement into the face (e.g., at 6, 34 blocks South).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
- BREAKABLE ROCK: Requires Rock Smash. Impassable.
- NPC: Impassable. Interact from adjacent tile.

# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The Southern Corridor Trek (Verified Land Route)
- Plan:
  1. Select NO to Surf prompt at (12, 28). [DONE]
  2. Walk South to (12, 49), then West to (10, 49).
  3. Walk South through the ledge gap at (10, 50) to (10, 51).
  4. Walk West to the West Beach corridor at (2, 51).
  5. Walk North along X=2 to Row 12.
  6. Walk East to (14, 12), then North to (14, 10).
- Status: At (12, 28), heading South.
- Reasoning: Row 50/51 contains a confirmed ledge gap at X=10 that provides access to the clear West Beach corridor (X=2), bypassing all city walls and the buoy maze.
