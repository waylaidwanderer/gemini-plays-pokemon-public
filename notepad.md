- Note: Suicune moves every time the player transitions between routes or cities.

# Lessons Learned
- Cannot use FLY from inside buildings; must be outdoors.
- Roaming Pokemon (Suicune) relocate upon EVERY map transition.
- FLYING forces roaming Pokemon to a completely random location in Johto.
- Poké Mart inventories scale with Badge progress; Super Repels appear later.
- Interacting with clerks behind counters: Face the counter tile, not the NPC.
## Bike Shop Strategy
- Shop is at Goldenrod City (29, 29).
- Manager (Clerk) is at (7, 2) behind a counter.
- To interact: Stand at (5, 2), face Right, and press A.
- Goal: Borrow a Bicycle to advertise the shop (and chase Suicune).
