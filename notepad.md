# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Active Strategy: The Northern Plateau Surf Landing
The northern plateau (14, 10) is accessible by Surfing north through the central lake (X=15 corridor) and landing at (13, 16). This bypasses all city walls and smashable rocks.

### The Path to Suicune
1. Navigate to the shore at (12, 28). (In Progress)
2. Surf North to Row 16 at (14, 16).
3. Land at (13, 16).
4. Walk North-East to trigger Suicune at (14, 10).

## Verified Mechanics
- Central Lake: X=15 is a clear vertical corridor of WATER from Row 30 to Row 16.
- Plateau Landing: (13, 16) is a FLOOR tile adjacent to WATER (14, 16), allowing landing.
- Smashable Rocks: Only necessary for the western land path. Surf bypasses them.
