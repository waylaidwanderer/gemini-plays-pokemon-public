### Tile Traversal Protocol
- **Testing Mandate:** When a new, reachable tile type is seen, I MUST test it immediately.
- **Movement Test:** Attempt to move *into* and *out of* the tile from all 4 cardinal directions to verify passability.
- **Ledge Test:** For any ledge-like tile, I must attempt to move up/against the apparent direction of the ledge to confirm if it is a one-way path.
