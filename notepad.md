# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026
- Current Location: Goldenrod Flower Shop (Map 10_14)

### Immediate Goals
1. **Find Floria**: Explore the North-East corner of the National Park.
2. **Find Exit to Route 36**: Likely in the North-East.
3. **Get SquirtBottle**: Return to Flower Shop after finding Floria.

### Quest Log
- **Badges**: Zephyr, Hive, Plain.
- **Party**: All Healthy.
- **Mail Quest**: Active.
- **Contest**: Not entered (lack of Sport Balls/Bug Catching logic).

### Strategic Notes
- **SquirtBottle**: Need to talk to Floria to progress.
- **Current Location**: Route 36 / National Park East (Map 10_3).
- **Goal**: Find Floria.
- **Hypothesis**: Floria is in the National Park Main Area (Map 3_15).
- **Plan**: Enter Gatehouse via the Gate at (21, 7).
- **Obstacles**: Trainer at (20, 13) blocks direct path North; must flank East.

### Reflection (Turn 11925)
- **Progress**: Verified Floria is not at (31, 14).
- **Correction**: The entrance to the gatehouse appears to be the gate at (21, 7), not the pink building at (17, 8).
- **Next Steps**: Enter Gatehouse, check for Floria, then proceed to National Park.
