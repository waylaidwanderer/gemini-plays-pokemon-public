# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Current Task
- **Map 4_3**: Ecruteak City Pokémon Center.
- **Goal**: Exit and go to Mart.
- **Issue**: Nurse Joy is unresponsive (Bug/Glitch?).
- **Plan**:
  1. Go to Ecruteak Mart.
  2. Buy Revives (if available) and Super Potions.
  3. Manually heal Topaz and Garnet.
  4. Go to Dance Theater (Ecruteak) to battle Kimono Girls and get HM03 Surf.
  5. Try Center again later or use a different city's Center.

- **Map 3_13**: Tile (15, 4) is a BREAKABLE ROCK (impassable), despite being TYPE_3fe2. BFS will fail here. Go around via the Left side (Col 4).
- **Map 3_13**: Item at (14, 2) is blocked by Breakable Rock at (15, 4). Requires Rock Smash.
- **Exploration**: Checking bottom-right area (Cols 14-16) before leaving.
- **Reflection (Turn 14727)**:
  - **Progress**: Defeated Morty (Fog Badge)! Swapped Amethyst for Headache (Psyduck) to use Surf.
  - **Challenge**: Nurse Joy interaction loop/bug. Abandoned Center to buy supplies at Mart instead.
  - **Goal**: Buy Revives/Potions. Heal manually. Defeat Kimono Girls for Surf.
  - **Lesson**: If an interaction fails repeatedly, change the environment (leave/re-enter) or strategy (manual healing) immediately. Don't mash.
### Strategy Log
- **Ecruteak Gym**:
  - **Mechanics**: Ghosts here are Poison/Ghost.
  - **Weaknesses**: Ground (Dig/Mud-Slap), Psychic.
  - **Immunities**: Normal types (Amethyst/Bolin) are immune to Ghost moves.
  - **Lesson**: Mud-Slap hits Gastly (No Levitate in Gen 2).
  - **Plan**: Teach TM28 (Dig) to Garnet for high-power Ground coverage.
- **Immediate Task**: Heal -> Teach Dig -> Buy Potions -> Re-enter Gym.
### Mechanics
- **Ecruteak Gym**: Falling into a pitfall warps to the entrance. Intentionally stepping on one is faster than walking back.
- **Shopping Plan**:
  - Budget: ¥3610.
  - Target: Revive (x1) @ ¥1500, Super Potion (x3) @ ¥700. Total: ¥3600.
  - Backup: Super Potion (x5) @ ¥3500.
  - Current Action: Cancel Poké Ball selection and scroll down to find Revive.
