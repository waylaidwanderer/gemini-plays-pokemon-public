# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- Start Turn: 49750 (Approx)
- Start Time: 3:20 PM (Approx)

## Strategy: Western Corridor Land Route
The northern plateau (Row 10-15) is blocked by a wall/ledge at Row 15, except at the far West (X=0-2).
1. Land at (19, 30) (Completed).
2. Walk South to Row 33.
3. Walk West through the gap at (9, 33) to the Western Corridor (X=0-2).
4. Walk North through the corridor to Row 10.
5. Walk East along Row 10 to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

# Progress Notes
- Verified: Row 15, X=0-2 is FLOOR, providing a path North.
- Verified: Row 33 has a gap in the X=9 wall and is clear to the West.
- SUPER REPEL is active.
- Land Route is the confirmed path to the plateau.
