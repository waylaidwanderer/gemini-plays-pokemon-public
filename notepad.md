# Ice Path Strategy
- **Correction:** Left slide from Row 23 is blocked by walls at x=17. My previous insight was a hallucination.
- **Current State:** At (19, 23).
- **Plan:** Backtrack to Hub (13, 16).
- **Next Steps:**
  1. Re-examine Entrance area (Rows 17-19, x=0-4) for a path to West Corridor.
  2. Re-examine North Alcove (Row 15) for hidden paths.
  3. Re-evaluate Ice Slides from (15, 16) and (19, 21).
- **Critical Question:** How to access the West Corridor (x=0) or North Ice Area?
  - All standard paths seem blocked.
  - Possibility: A specific ice slide sequence or a missed walk path near entrance.
