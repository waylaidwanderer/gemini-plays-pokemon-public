# Ilex Forest Strategy: Catching Farfetch'd

## Goal: Catch the runaway Farfetch'd to obtain HM01 (Cut).

## Farfetch'd Chase Mechanics
- **Bird Movement**: Flies ~4-5 tiles in a straight line away from the player when startled.
- **Startle Condition**: Interacting (A button) from any adjacent tile seems to cause flight.
- **Success Condition (Hypothesis)**: Must drive the bird into a corner or specific location, or interact from a very specific orientation (e.g., facing the same direction?). 
- **Apprentice Hint**: "You have to get behind it to catch it."

## Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR**: Passable.
- **WALL / DENSE_TREES**: Impassable.
- **HEADBUTT_TREE**: Impassable.
- **CUT_TREE**: Impassable. Requires HM01 Cut.
- **LEDGE_HOP**: One-way traversal (Down/Left/Right).

## Plan
1. Locate bird (last seen moving towards 24, 31).
2. Experiment with approach:
   - Approach from directly opposite facing (startle).
   - Approach from side (startle).
   - Look for "trapping" locations.
3. Drive bird towards Apprentice at (7, 28).

## Key Locations
- **Apprentice**: (7, 28).
- **Charcoal Kiln**: Azalea Town (21, 13).

## Party Status
- **Calcifer (QUILAVA) Lv22**: Lead.
- Team: ONIX, GEODUDE, PIDGEY, TOGEPI, EKANS.
