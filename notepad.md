# Quest Log
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Status:** Traversing Victory Road backwards.
- **Next:** Reach South Exit of Victory Road -> Reception Gate -> West -> Mt. Silver.

# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Location:** Victory Road Gate (Reception Gate).
- **Status:** Trying to exit West to Route 28.
- **Action:** Test Warp at (1, 7) by walking DOWN onto it or into the wall below.
- **Reasoning:** Walking Left onto (1, 7) didn't warp. The tile is "WARP_CARPET_DOWN", suggesting a directional trigger from the North, or potentially interacting with the boundary below.
- **Goal:** Trigger Warp to Route 28.

# Tile Mechanics
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN:** One-way South.
- **WARP_CARPET:** Step on to exit map.
- **CUT_TREE:** Obstacle unless Cut is used.
- **PIT:** Drops player to floor below.
- **LADDER:** Transitions between floors.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Acts as a wall when approaching from above (North).
- **BUOY:** Water boundary/Wall.
