# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Current Task
- **Status**: Trapped in Burned Tower 1F.
- **Location**: (7, 15).
- **Observation**: Standing on `TYPE_8564` (Hole graphic?) but not falling.
- **Discovery**: Tiles (9, 15) and (10, 15) are `TYPE_ffbb` (Likely Warp/Hole).
- **Plan**: Navigate to (10, 15) to try falling there.
- **Route**: Up to (7, 14) -> Right to (10, 14) -> Down to (10, 15).
- **Party**: Garnet (77/90).
- **Goal**: Fall to B1F -> Find Legendary Beasts.

### Party Status
- Garnet (32) [Critical], Basil (9), Amethyst (10) [Fainted], Spinarak (14), Topaz (15) [Fainted], Harrz (14) [Fainted].

### Reflection & Plan
- **Reflection**: I've been hallucinating exits. `find_reachable_exits` confirmed I am trapped. I must rely on game mechanics (triggers/holes) rather than hoping for walls to disappear.
- **Eusine**: He ran away to the SE. Following his path might reveal the way.
- **Plan**: Move South to (10, 10). Search adjacent tiles.
- **Route**: (10, 5) -> South to (10, 10).
