### Strategic Reflection (Turn 8719)
- **Status**: Stuck in Goldenrod for ~100 turns.
- **Issue**: Oscillating between East/West without clearing the "fog of war".
- **Insight**: The North-East (Flower Shop) is a cul-de-sac. The Central North Wall seems solid. The only remaining option is the North-West quadrant, which is largely "unseen".
- **Action Plan**: 
    1. Return to Main Street (y=10).
    2. Move West to x=6.
    3.Systematically explore North from there, hugging the West edge.

### Navigation Notes
- **Location**: Goldenrod City North.
- **Goal**: Reach Route 35.
- **Status**: At the Gatehouse/Building blocking Main Street (y=7).
- **Observation**: The street is blocked by a building spanning x=14 to x=17.
- **Action**: Entering the door at (15, 7).
- **Hypothesis**: This building connects the South side (y=8) to the North side (y=0).

### Map Structure
- **Gatehouse/Passage**: (15, 7).
- **Route 35 Exit**: Likely at (16, 0).
- **Flower Shop**: Accessible via x=18 gap, but likely a cul-de-sac.
- **Gym**: East side (24, 7).
