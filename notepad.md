# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The Sequential Gap Path (Optimized)
- Plan:
  1. Surf North to (27, 10). [IN PROGRESS]
  2. West to (23, 10), then South to (23, 14).
  3. West through Gap 4 (19, 14) to (18, 14).
  4. North to (18, 11), then West to (16, 11) and land.
  5. Walk to (14, 10).
- Status: At (27, 13) surfing, in battle.
- Reasoning: X=27 is a clear channel. Row 10 is a clear channel from X=27 to X=23. Column 23 is a clear channel from Row 10 to Row 14. Gap 4 is the only entry to the inner northern channel pocket.
