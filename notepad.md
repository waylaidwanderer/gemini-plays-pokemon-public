# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Deliver Kenya to Route 31.
- **Secondary Goal:** Travel to Mahogany Town (Route 42).
- **Tertiary Goal:** Train Party to Level 30+.

## Quest: Deliver Kenya (Route 31)
- **Status:** Retrying with Period.
- **Hypothesis:** Rejection was due to missing period or sender check. Trying exact text with period.
- **Previous Attempt:** "Dark Cave leads to another road" (Mixed, No Period) -> Rejected.
- **New Plan:**
    1. Take Mail off Kenya.
    2. Rewrite: "Dark Cave leads to another road." (Mixed, WITH Period).
    3. Deliver.
- **Contingency:** If this fails, the sender (WEBSTER vs GEM) might be the key, or I need to talk to the Guard.

## Knowledge Base
- **Fisher (Route 31):** Rejected "DARK CAVE leads to another road." (All Caps) and "DARK CAVE".
- **Wade (Route 31):** Called (Turn 9576). Waiting on Route 31. He might have the answer!
- **Dark Cave:** Connects Route 31, 45, 46. Needs Flash.

## Mechanics Log
- **Mail:** Prevents deposit. PC Full -> Mail goes to Bag. Must hold nothing to attach.
- **Inputs:** Pressing Start in Mail menu triggers Printer Error. Use B.
- **Lesson:** Pressing 'Start' in the Mail menu causes a "Printer Error" loop or crash behavior. Use 'B' to exit or 'END' to finish.
- **Menu Nav:** Cursor positions are remembered. Always verify position before confirming.
