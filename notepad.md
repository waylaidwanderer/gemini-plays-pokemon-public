# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Location:** Route 28 (Gatehouse Area).
- **Status:** Checking potential hidden path.
- **Action:** Close text, move to (30, 4), check for Cut tree or hidden items.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. The path north of the sign seems to dead-end at (30, 4)/(31, 4) according to the map, but it's suspicious.
  2. Will investigate if the trees are cuttable.
  3. If not, will enter the Gatehouse to see if there's a side exit.
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Need to reach the hidden house at (7, 3).
  2. Standard pathing hasn't revealed a way yet.
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.

# Tile Mechanics
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN:** One-way South.
- **LEDGE_HOP_LEFT:** One-way Left.
- **WARP_CARPET:** Step on to exit map.
- **CUT_TREE:** Obstacle unless Cut is used.
- **PIT:** Drops player to floor below.
- **LADDER:** Transitions between floors.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Walkable from South/Sides. Northbound exit is BLOCKED (Verified at 8,14). Acts as a one-way ledge preventing Northward movement.
- **BUOY:** Water boundary/Wall.

# Reflection (Turn 25132)
- **Status:** Exploring Mt. Silver Cave 1F.
- **Hygiene:** Notepad and Map Markers are up to date.
- **Goals:** Clear. Exploring North to find Red.
- **Strategy:** Testing if FLOOR_UP_WALL tiles at Row 20 are traversable from the South.
- **Tools:** Current set is sufficient.
