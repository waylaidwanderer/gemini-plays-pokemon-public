# Strategic Notes
## Objectives
- **Primary:** Complete Pokedex.
- **Secondary:** Hunt Roaming Beasts (Raikou/Entei).
- **Navigation:** Return to Ecruteak City.

## Roamer Hunt
- **Target:** Raikou & Entei.
- **Method:** Route 37 Loop.
- **Note:** No trapper in party. Goal is to encounter for Dex tracking.

## Observations & Tips
- **Menu Navigation:** `navigate_menu` can register double inputs. Use `press_buttons` for precision if needed.
- **Celadon Dept Store:** 2F has Repels (Left Clerk) and TMs (3F).
- **Exploration:** Unmarked warps at (16,3) & (17,3) (Celadon Mansion back?).

# Current Strategy
## Roamer Hunt (Raikou/Entei)
- **Goal:** Encounter Raikou and Entei to register them in Pokedex.
- **Location:** Blackthorn City (Current).
- **Next Step:** Exit Mart, Fly to Ecruteak City.
- **Loop:** Switch between Ecruteak and Route 37 to trigger roamer movement.
- **Supplies:** 10 Super Repels acquired.
- **Note on Master Ball:** Elm did not provide it. Checked Lab and Player PC. Possible I need to wait for a phone call from him first. Proceeding with Roamer Hunt (tracking only) for now.
