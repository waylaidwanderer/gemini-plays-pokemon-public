# B1F Boulder Puzzle
- Attempt Start: Turn 28546 (Sunday, Dec 28, 4:26 AM).
- Pit Locations: P1 (11, 2), P2 (4, 7), P3 (5, 12), P4 (12, 13)
- B1F Layout: Brown floor tiles are NOT slippery. Rows 1-2 have ICE tiles.
- Status: B1 at (10, 1) in B1F. B2 at (5, 6) in B1F. B3 at (3, 12) in B2F. B4 at (12, 13) in B2F.
- Pit 3 (5, 12) and Pit 4 (12, 13) FILLED (Confirmed by boulders on B2F).
- Pits 1 (11, 2) and 2 (4, 7) UNFILLED.

## Strategy: Boulder 1 (ID 1) -> Pit 1 (11, 2)
1. Get to (9, 1) on B1F.
2. Push RIGHT to (11, 1).
3. Move to (11, 0), push DOWN into Pit 1.

## Strategy: Boulder 2 (ID 2) -> Pit 2 (4, 7)
1. Get to (6, 6) on B1F.
2. Push LEFT to (4, 6).
3. Move to (4, 5), push DOWN into Pit 2.

# Game Mechanics
## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR (Brown): Walkable, non-sliding.
- ICE (Rows 1-2 in B1F, most of B2F): Sliding mechanic. 
- PIT: Warp to B2F. Filling a pit creates a stopper on B2F.
- BOULDER: Boulders on floor reset on ladder use. Boulders in pits are permanent.
- STRENGTH: Deactivates after EVERY battle or floor change. Verified. MUST reactivate immediately after any battle when puzzling.

# Tracking
- P3 and P4 filled. P1 and P2 unfilled.

# Failed Hypotheses
- "B1F floor tiles do NOT slide" was too broad; Row 1-2 ice tiles DO slide.
- "Boulder 1 is at (11, 5)" - Incorrect, it was pushed to (10, 5).
- "Mixed inputs in menus" - Always use single actions or autopress.
- "navigation_and_puzzle_solver" tool - Hallucinated. Use built-in tools.
