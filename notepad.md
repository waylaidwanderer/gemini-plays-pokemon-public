## III. Area & Navigation Insights

### Tile Traversal Rules (Verified)
- **Objects are impassable:** All map objects (items, trees, signs, defeated trainers etc.) act as walls.
- **WALL:** Impassable.
- **FLOOR:** Traversable.
- **TALL_GRASS:** Traversable, triggers wild encounters.
- **LEDGE:** One-way downward traversal.
- **FLOOR_HOP_*_LEDGE:** One-way traversal in the specified direction.
- **COUNTER:** Impassable.
- **DOOR/CAVE:** Warp tile, triggered by movement.

- **VOID:** Impassable.
- **WARP_CARPET_*: Warp tile, direction-specific.
- **FRUIT_TREE:** Impassable object, may yield items.
- **LADDER:** A warp tile triggered by movement. Can be one-way (e.g., SproutTower2F (10, 14) is one-way down) or two-way.
- **STATUE:** An impassable scenery object.

### Sprout Tower Layout
- The central pillar on 1F and 2F is a complete divider, preventing east-west travel. **(Hypothesis proven false on 2F)**
- To cross between the east and west sides, one must use the 3rd floor. **(Hypothesis proven false)**
- The main tower exit is on the eastern side of the 1st floor at (9, 15).

## IV. Untested Hypotheses & To-Do
- **Hypothesis:** Can Onix or Hoothoot learn Flash (HM05)?
- **To-Do:** Test teaching Flash as soon as I exit Sprout Tower.

## Sprout Tower Escape Plan (V6 - Exploration)
Hypothesis: A path connecting the west and east sides of SproutTower2F exists through the large unseen area in the center.
1. From my current position at (2, 6), navigate to the edge of the unseen area at (8, 9).
2. Explore eastward from (8, 9) to reveal the path.
3. Once on the eastern side, find the ladder down to 1F.
4. On 1F, navigate to the main tower exit at (9, 15).
