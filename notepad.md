# Blocked Routes (Verified)
- Central City: Vertical wall at X=9 (Rows 34-37). Cliff at Row 30.
- Plateau Access: Row 29 is a clear East-West path from X=19 to X=2, bypassing the Row 30 cliff and city walls.
- Southern Corridor: Row 47/48 provides a path from the east side (X=19) to the west beach (X=2), bypassing the central maze.

# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The Great Western Highway
- Plan:
  1. Use Super Repel. [DONE]
  2. Navigate to (18, 45) via the eastern corridor. [IN PROGRESS]
  3. Navigate to (2, 47) via Row 48 gap.
  4. Walk North along West Beach to (2, 12).
  5. Walk East to (14, 12) then North to (14, 10).
- Status: At (19, 30) on land.
- Reasoning: The city is a vertical maze, but Row 47/48 and Row 12 are the horizontal arteries that connect the east and west sides.

# General Lessons
- City Layouts: In Johto cities like Cianwood, horizontal paths (Rows) often bypass vertical blockades (Walls) even if they look like a maze. Always check the full length of a Row for gaps.
