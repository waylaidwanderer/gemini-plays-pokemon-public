# Reflection (Turn 15741)
- **Status:** Suicune hunt stalled. Suicune missing from Tin Tower 1F.
- **Current Hypothesis:** I need to reset the event by speaking to the Wise Trio at the Barrier Station Main Entrance, or use the Clear Bell at the correct time/place.
- **Action:** Traversing back from Tin Tower to Ecruteak City side of Barrier Station.
- **Lesson:** Legendaries in Gen 2 can have complex spawn triggers. White-outs might reset/despawn them until a map reload or specific NPC interaction.

# Suicune Mystery Log
- **Encounters:** Battled once, whited out.
- **Search 1 (Immediate Return):** Suicune absent at (9,9).
- **Search 2 (Map Reload):** Suicune absent.
- **Pokedex:** Not showing as roaming (only Poliwag/Gyarados in Water search).
- **Key Item:** Clear Bell ("Not the time to use that" at 10,2).

# Navigation
- **Current Map:** WiseTriosRoom (4_2).
- **Goal:** Exit via (7,4) to reach Barrier Station Main Hall (Left Side).
- **Navigation Anomaly:** Taking the Left Ladder `(1,4)` in Wise Trio Room `(4_2)` placed me at `(17,3)` in Barrier Station `(4_1)`, which is the **Right Side**.
- **Hypothesis:** I am on the "Tower" side of the Barrier Station. To reach the "City" side (Left Side), I must find a connector.
- **Action:** Investigating the Ladder at `(17,15)` on `4_1` (Right Side). It likely leads to the City side or a basement connector.
