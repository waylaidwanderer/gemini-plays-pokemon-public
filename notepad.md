# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
- **Start Turn:** 49885
- **Current Status:** Executing the "Eastern Perimeter Loop" (Row 51 via Surf).

## Active Strategy: The Eastern Perimeter Loop
The northern plateau (14, 10) is accessible via the western coastal highway (X=2). To reach X=2 without hitting elevation traps, we loop around the eastern ocean to Row 51.

### Execution Plan
1. Central Pivot: Navigate to (12, 28) (Central Surf Point). (In Progress)
2. Sea Crossing: Surf to (20, 32) and land.
3. Southern Descent: Walk south to (20, 51).
4. Great Western Traverse: Walk west along Row 51 to (2, 51).
5. Coastal Highway: Walk north along X=2 to Row 12.
6. Trigger: Walk east to (14, 10).

## Verified Mechanics
- Row 51: Completely clear from X=2 to X=24.
- X=2 Highway: Clear path from Row 51 to Row 12.
- Surf Route: (12, 28) -> (20, 32) is clear of buoys.

## Battle Plan: Eusine
- Expected Team: Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25).
- Lead: Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion).
- Strategy: Flamethrower sweep.

## Failed Hypotheses
- Hypothesis 1: Land access via X=11 (blocked by Row 30 wall).
- Hypothesis 2: Land access via X=6 (blocked by Row 34 elevation trap).
- Hypothesis 3: Cut tree at (11, 13) (fake tree).
- Hypothesis 4: Direct land loop via X=7 gap (blocked by Row 50 traps).

## Map Markers
- (4, 19), (4, 25), (10, 27), (5, 29): ROCK objects.
- (14, 10): Suicune sighting point.
