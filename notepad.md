# Strategy: The Suicune Pursuit
- **Objective:** Trigger Suicune sighting at (14, 10) in northern Cianwood.
- **Eusine Battle Prep:** Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25). Strategy: Lead with Lv64 Calcifer. Sweep with Flamethrower/Thunderpunch.
- **Current Plan (North Bypass via X=2):**
  1. Navigate to (6, 29).
  2. Smash rock at (5, 29).
  3. Move to (2, 29) and walk North to (2, 10).
  4. Walk East to (14, 10).
- **Alternative (Northern Wall Check):** Check if (12, 15) or (11, 15) are mislabeled rocks.
- **Contingency:** If walking paths fail, use Surf around the east side buoy gap at (23, 7). Landing spot: (16, 10).

# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard traversable terrain.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable terrain.
- WATER: Traversable only with Surf.
- DOOR / WARP_CARPET: Map transition points.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump down (South). Blocks North.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Terrace edges. (6, 46) blocks Down movement from (6, 45).
- ROCK (Object): Blocks movement; cleared with Rock Smash. Respawns upon map transition.

# Lessons Learned
- **Cianwood Pathing:** (11, 15) is a dead-end pocket. (6, 46) blocks South movement from (6, 45).
- **Advisor Advice:** "Forget the South Bypass; the path is strictly north."
- **Time Check:** Attempting sighting since Turn #50620. Commit to X=2 corridor by Turn #50900.
