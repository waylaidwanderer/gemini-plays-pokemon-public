# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard ground. Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Surf required. Traversable.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- DOOR: Warp point.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable cliff face. Blocks movement into the face (e.g., at 6, 34 and 4, 30).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
- BREAKABLE ROCK: Requires Rock Smash. Impassable.
- NPC: Impassable. Interact from adjacent tile.

# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The Gatekeeper Path (Verified Buoy Maze Route)
- Plan:
  1. Surf at (19, 30) into the main channel. [IN PROGRESS]
  2. Navigate to (27, 10) then West through Gap 1 (26, 10).
  3. Navigate South to Gap 6 (23, 15) then West/South through Gap 2 (22, 16).
  4. Navigate North to Gap 4 (19, 14) to enter the inner northern channel.
  5. Navigate West to (17, 11) and land at (16, 11).
  6. Walk to (14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Status: At (12, 28), returning to the surf point at (19, 30).
- Reasoning: Gap 4 is the only opening into the water channel above the Row 15 cliff line. All other routes are blocked by ledges or buoys.
