# I. Game Mechanics & World Rules

## A. Tile Mechanics & Traversal
- **Ground:** Standard walkable tile.
- **Grass:** Walkable tile where wild Pokémon can be encountered.
- **Water:** Can be crossed using the SURF HM.
- **Impassable:** Walls, trees, and other objects that block movement. Interacting with them does nothing.
- **Elevated Ground:** Walkable ground at a different elevation. Cannot use Surf from this tile type.
- **Gate (`gate_offscreen`, `closed_gate`, `open_gate`):** Barriers that may open or close.
- **Boulder Switch:** A floor switch activated by a boulder. Is a traversable tile.
- **Boulder Barrier:** An impassable barrier that becomes a `cleared_boulder_barrier` tile when the corresponding switch is activated.
- **Cleared Boulder Barrier:** A traversable ground tile that appears after a boulder puzzle is solved. It allows movement between different elevations, acting like a ramp.
- **Steps:** Allows vertical movement between `ground` and `elevated_ground` tiles. Pushing boulders onto them is not possible.
- **Ladders (`ladder_up`, `ladder_down`):** Function as instant 1x1 warps between floors.
- **Hole:** A tile that functions as a warp, dropping the player to a lower floor. Boulders can be pushed into these to affect puzzles on the floor below.
- **Spinner (`spinner_up`, `spinner_down`, `spinner_left`, `spinner_right`):** Forces movement in the specified direction.
- **Boulder Pushing Mechanic (RE-CORRECTED):** To push a boulder, use Strength, then stand on a tile adjacent to the boulder and face it. Pressing the directional button towards the boulder will move it one tile, but the player character does NOT move.

## B. General Rules & Heuristics
- **PC Interaction:** To use a PC, stand directly below it, face up, and press 'A'.
- **HM Usage:** HMs are used from the party menu. Fainted Pokémon can use field moves.
- **"No Will to Fight" Message (Correction):** Appears when the party menu cursor is on a fainted Pokémon.
- **Level Cap:** The level cap with 8 badges is 65.
- **Special NPC Interaction:** Certain puzzles may require walking *through* an NPC rather than interacting with them (e.g., Summer Beach House).
- **PC Tile Anomaly:** The tile for interacting with the Pokémon Center PC is sometimes labeled as `grass` in the map data, despite being indoors.

# III. Current Objective: Victory Road & The Pokémon League
**Primary Goal:** Defeat the Elite Four and become the Pokémon League Champion.
**Secondary Goal:** Solve the Victory Road boulder puzzles to reach the exit.

# IV. Core Gameplay Lessons
- **Core Principle: Fix, Don't Defer.** Critical tools with known bugs MUST be fixed immediately. Deferring fixes is a strategic failure.
- **Core Principle: Verify, Then Trust.** Tool outputs and personal assumptions are hypotheses, not facts. They must be verified against the game state before being trusted. The Game State Information is the only source of truth.
- **Boulder Puzzle Strategy:** Before pushing any boulder, use the pathfinder to verify the entire route for both the player and the boulder to prevent soft-locking.
- **Debugging Strategy:** When a tool fails, add extensive logging to understand its internal state before attempting a fix.

# V. Archives

## A. Completed Puzzles
### Victory Road 2F Puzzle
- **Status:** Complete. Boulder from (4, 16) to switch at (2, 17).

### Victory Road 3F Puzzle
- **Status:** Complete. Secret ladder at (3, 1) was the true path.

# VI. Victory Road 1F Puzzle Status
- **Current State:** Trapped in the western section. Boulders at (6,17) and (3,10) block progress.

## Current Hypotheses (from Agent)
- The boulder at (6, 17) must be pushed onto a hidden, unmarked switch tile.
- The solution requires a specific sequence of pushes on the boulder at (6, 17).
- A hidden item is under the boulder at (6, 17), findable with the Itemfinder.

## Invalidated Hypotheses (from Agent)
- Using 'Dig' or 'Teleport' to escape (Cannot access PC).
- Intentionally losing a battle to 'white out' (Against core rules).
- Puzzle requires a pre-emptive solution (Cannot reset to previous save).

## Failed Hypotheses Log (Victory Road 1F)
- Pushing boulder (6,16) in any direction leads to a soft-lock.
- Pushing boulder (3,11) north to (3,10) leads to a soft-lock.
- There are no hidden one-way ledges or passages through walls in the western section.
- The HM FLY cannot be used to escape Victory Road.
