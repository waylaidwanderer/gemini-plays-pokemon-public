# Quest: Legendary Hunt
- Target: Suicune (Tin Tower)
- Lore: Ho-Oh resurrected Suicune, Entei, and Raikou.
- Requirements: Clear Bell (Owned), 16 Badges (Owned).
- Plan:
    1. Release Beasts (Burned Tower) - DONE.
    2. Defeat Wise Trio (Tin Tower Gatehouse 4_1/4_2) - IN PROGRESS (Started Turn 46251).
    3. Battle Suicune (Tin Tower 1F).

# Strategy: Suicune Capture
- Lead: XENON (Haunter, Lv 44). Land Hypnosis immediately.
- Chipping: Use Night Shade twice (88 fixed damage). A Level 40 Suicune has ~130-142 HP, so this is safe. Switch to GORP (Snorlax, Lv 50) or KIMCHI (Gloom, Lv 52) if needed. Avoid Calcifer (Lv 64).
- Status: Maintain Sleep. If Sleep fails, use KIMCHI's Stun Spore for permanent Paralysis.
- Capture: Ultra Balls while asleep.
- Items: Ultra Balls (32), Full Restore (for status inflictor).

# Observations: Wise Trio

- Building 4_2: Empty.
- Tin Tower 1F (3_4): Sages Koji (ID 5), ID 6, ID 7 give lore dialogue.
