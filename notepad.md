## Strategy: West Beach Highway via Row 52 Bypass
**Start Turn:** 48900 (Quest: Trigger Suicune Overworld Sighting)

The buoy maze is inefficient. I will use the 'West Beach Highway' (X=2) accessible via the southern bypass at Row 52.

### Step-by-Step Execution Plan
1. Land on the East Shore at (23, 32). <- CURRENT TASK
2. Apply Super Repel.
3. Walk South to (23, 52).
4. Walk West to (2, 52), bypassing the city walls (X=11, 9, 7, 5).
5. Walk North along the West Beach Highway (X=2) to (2, 14).
6. Walk East to (8, 14), then North to (8, 10).
7. Walk East to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune sighting.

## Tile Mechanics: Cianwood City
- FLOOR: Standard ground.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Surf required.
- BUOY: Impassable water barrier.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way barrier. Blocks DOWN movement. Allows UP and East-West movement.

## Navigation: Landmarks
- Row 52 Bypass: Clear terrestrial path from East Shore (X=23) to West Beach (X=2).
- West Beach Highway (X=2): Clear North-South passage from Row 53 to Row 14.
- Plateau Entrance (8, 14): Access point from Row 14 corridor.

## Inventory Check
- Super Repel: 5 remaining. Last expired Turn 49311. Re-apply after landing.
- Party: Calcifer (Lv 64) leads. Ready for Eusine.
