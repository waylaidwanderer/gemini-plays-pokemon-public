# Current Objectives
*   **Primary Goal:** Obtain the Boulder Badge from the Pewter City Gym Leader, Brock.
*   **Secondary Goal:** Acquire sufficient funds to purchase essential supplies. (Current Money: ¬•156)
*   **Tertiary Goal:** Explore Route 2 (south of Pewter City) for trainers/items to acquire funds.

# Current Plan - Route 2 Exploration
*   **Objective:** Navigate from current position (12,19) to the south exit of Pewter City (aiming for (19,36)) to reach Route 2.
*   **Reason:** Acquire funds and EXP by exploring Route 2, as Route 3 is currently inaccessible due to the recurring Youngster escort event (8 failed attempts to reach Route 3).
*   **Status:** Will request path from `map_analyzer_agent`.

# Lessons Learned - Pewter Navigation Summary
*   Pewter City navigation is complex, with multiple failed attempts (7 prior attempts) to find a clear path to Route 3 due to blockades (e.g., (19,19), (19,21), (13,17), NPC at (9,16), Gym Sign at (12,18), impassable (13,16)) and the recurring Youngster escort event.
*   Reliance on `map_analyzer_agent` is key, but its paths need careful, segmented validation, especially after unexpected game state changes or discovered obstacles.
*   `exploration_planner_agent` has been unreliable and should be avoided or its prompt reviewed.
*   The Youngster escort event (ID 5, trigger near (36,17)) is a major recurring obstacle, frequently resetting progress towards the east exit.

# Known Pathing Obstacles in Pewter City (Key Blockers)
*   (19,21) & (19,19) - Impassable.
*   (18,18) - Impassable.
*   (5,22) & (17,22) - Impassable.
*   (13,17) - Impassable.
*   Cool Trainer F at (9,16) blocks passage on Y=16 unless approached correctly.
*   (34,20) - Impassable building facade (Police Notice Sign).
*   X=36 column is largely impassable from Y=21 down to Y=32.
*   Gym Sign at (12,18) - Impassable.
*   Tile (13,16) - Impassable (Gym roof).

# Agent Usage Plan
*   **`map_analyzer_agent`:** Primary tool for pathfinding. Critically review its output and validate paths in segments.
*   **`move_validator_agent`:** Use for genuinely complex, risky, or unclear path segments. Avoid overuse for simple, straight paths, especially if following a path from `map_analyzer_agent`.
*   **`exploration_planner_agent`:** Unreliable. Avoid.
*   **`scripted_event_tracker_agent`:** Keep in mind for Youngster near Route 3 exit.
*   **`money_management_agent`:** Use once funds are acquired.
*   **`route_progress_analyzer_agent`:** Use once on Route 3.
*   **`battle_log_analyzer_agent`:** Use after battles.

# Game Mechanics & Strategy Notes
*   **Ledge Mechanics:** One-way (downwards only).
*   **Movement:** 1st press TURNS if not facing, 2nd press MOVES. Pikachu: 1st press turns, 2nd moves if moving *into* his tile and not facing him.
*   **Level Cap:** 0 badges = Lv12.
*   **Map Marker Legend:** üí• (Event Trigger), üéØ (Key Nav Point), ‚ùó (Risky Zone/Obstacle), üíÅ (Event NPCs), ‚ò†Ô∏è (Defeated), üèõÔ∏è (Building), üìç (Path Start), üß± (Impassable), üö™ (Used Warp), ‚ÑπÔ∏è (Info NPC).
*   **Tile Navigability:** Inferred from tile `type` and objects. Cross-reference screen, XML, and game state.

# Party Status
*   SPBARKY (PIKACHU): Lv12 (39/39 HP) (Capped)
*   FLAREE (VULPIX): Lv8 (26/26 HP)
*   ODDISH (ODDISH): Lv12 (37/37 HP) (Capped)

# Hindsight & Lessons Learned (General & Recent Critiques)
*   **Goal Formulation:** Goals should describe OUTCOMES, not methods.
*   **Agent Output Review:** Critically review agent-provided paths. Agents can make mistakes or provide paths that become invalid due to new information or misinterpretations of game state (e.g., assuming a background object is passable).
*   **Simplify Pathing:** When a direct path is clear, avoid over-validating. Execute longer movement sequences.
*   **Map Awareness:** Continuously reinforce mental model of the current map, especially locations of known persistent obstacles. Be aware of dynamic obstacles like NPCs and scripted events.
*   **Youngster Escort:** This event is a major impediment. If triggered, pathing needs to restart from the Gym entrance. Need a strategy to avoid or mitigate this event if possible. (Current thought: try to stay south of Y=17 when approaching the far east of Pewter City).

# Contingency Planning (Post-Critique)
*   If Attempt #8 to reach Route 3 fails, I MUST abandon the Route 3 tertiary goal. Alternative actions: 1) Find other ways to get funds (e.g., re-explore Route 2 for missed trainers/items). 2) Assess if current team is strong enough to challenge Brock directly. 3) Explore south from Pewter City more thoroughly.
*   If `exploration_planner_agent` fails again, its system prompt needs review for potential improvements or the agent might be deleted.

# Pewter City - Route 3 Attempts Summary
*   Attempted to reach Route 3 eight times. All attempts were ultimately blocked by the Youngster escort event or by impassable terrain discovered mid-path. The eastern exit is currently considered too unreliable to pursue for funds. Pivoting to Route 2 exploration.
