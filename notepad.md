# Suicune Capture Strategy
- Attempt 1: Failed (Turn #11814). Whited out.
- Status: Party fully healed. Suicune reset to full HP (if present).
- Strategy (Round 2): Lead with KIMCHI (Gloom) for Sleep Powder. If Suicune is asleep, throw Great Balls. Use Smokescreen (Typhlosion) as backup to tank hits.
- Task: Restock and Prepare. (Start Turn: #11815, 4:00 AM)
- Plan: Check Directory at (14, 0) on 5F to confirm Revive availability. If not sold in store, Fly to Ecruteak.
- Lesson: Always verify Map ID before assuming floor transitions in multi-floor buildings to avoid time loops.

# Strategy for Suicune Rematch
1. Lead with KIMCHI.
2. Use Sleep Powder until Suicune falls asleep.
3. Switch to Calcifer and use Smokescreen to max out evasion if needed, or just start throwing Great Balls while it sleeps.
4. If Suicune wakes up, re-apply Sleep.
5. Goal: Catch Suicune without whiting out.
