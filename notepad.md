# Suicune Quest (Crystal) - FIXED SIGHTINGS
- Milestone 1: Burned Tower (Seen).
- Milestone 2: Cianwood City (Seen). Defeated Eusine.
- Milestone 3: Route 42 (In Progress). Pokedex shows Suicune here.
- Milestone 4: Route 36 (Next).
- Milestone 5: Tin Tower (Final). Requirement: Clear Bell (OBTAINED) + all sightings.

## Strategy for Route 42 Sighting:
- Priority 1: Western Pocket (Rows 1-2, X=7-11). Access via Mt. Mortar entrance (10, 5).
- Priority 2: Middle Island (X=24-30, Y=14-17). Approach from all sides.
- Status: Island sweep (multiple passes) failed. Moving to Western Pocket.

# General Lessons Learned
- Menu Navigation: If B closes a sub-menu, ensure the main menu is also closed before overworld movement.
- Surfing: Face the water tile directly and use the menu or press A if prompted. Don't spam buttons at (40, 11) without facing (39, 11).
- Time Blindness: Record start turns for long tasks to avoid looping indefinitely.

# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Traversable with HM03 SURF.
- TALL_GRASS / LONG_GRASS: Traversable; triggers encounters.
- LEDGE: One-way traversable (usually South).
- WARP / DOOR / WARP_CARPET / CAVE: Map transition. Step triggers warp.
- FRUIT_TREE: Impassable; interact for fruit/apricorn.
- HEADBUTT_TREE: Impassable; interact with HM02 HEADBUTT.
- CUT_TREE: Impassable until cleared with HM01 CUT.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way wall; jumpable from North to South.

# Failed Hypotheses
- Suicune Sighting (Route 42): Island center sweep (X=24-30, Y=14-17) failed (Turns 17968-18021).
- Hypothesis: Suicune is at the Apricorn trees (28, 16). Status: DENIED.
- Hypothesis: Northern Plateau (Rows 0-2) reachable via (48, 3). Status: DENIED.

# Discoveries
- Western Pocket: Reachable from western Mt. Mortar entrance (10, 5).
- Headbutt Trees: Numerous on Route 42 (documented in markers).
- Dead End: (48, 3) plateau is a dead end.
