## Suicune Quest (Started Turn 49107)
- Goal: Trigger Suicune sighting at (14, 10).
- Strategy: Use the "Inner Channel Landing" (13, 16) to reach the northern plateau.

## Plan: Reach Suicune at (14, 10)
- Step 1: Surf North to (27, 21). <- CURRENT TASK
- Step 2: Surf West to (14, 21) via (19, 21) Buoy Gap.
- Step 3: Surf North to (14, 16) and land at (13, 16).
- Step 4: Walk to (14, 10) via (11, 15) and (13, 13).
  (13, 16) -> (11, 16) -> (11, 15) -> (11, 14) -> (13, 14) -> (13, 12) -> (14, 12) -> (14, 10).

## Verified Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Requires Surf.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable cliff face.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
- BUOY: Impassable hard wall.

## Navigation Insights
- Row 21 Highway: Clear horizontal water path from X=27 to X=12. Bypasses buoy walls at X=22 and X=19.
- Inner Channel Landing (13, 16): Reliable landing point adjacent to (14, 16) WATER.
- Row 15 Gap: X=11 is a narrow FLOOR path between a ledge (X=10) and a wall (X=12).
- Row 13 Wall: Blockade from X=9 to X=12. Bypass at (13, 13).

## Battle Strategy: Eusine
