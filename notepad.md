# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Stop Team Rocket.
- **Secondary Goal:** Investigate Radio Tower (Team Rocket takeover).
- **Navigation:** Removing Mail from Kenya.
- **Status:** Resetting Menu State and Opening Party Correctly.
- **Reason:** Previous attempt likely opened Pokedex (Start->A). Must use Start->Down->A for Party.
- **Plan:**
    1. Reset to Overworld (B x4).
    2. Open Party Menu Correctly (Start, Down, A).
    3. Select Kenya (Down x4, A).
    4. Select MAIL -> TAKE MAIL.
    5. Deposit Kenya.

# Reflection (Turn 11638)
- **Execution:** PC navigation has been clumsy. Repeatedly tried to deposit Kenya with Mail, which failed. "Move w/o Mail" also proved confusing/ineffective.
- **Lesson:** Mail MUST be removed via the Party Menu ("TAKE MAIL") before depositing a Pokémon. PC "Move w/o Mail" is unreliable or requires specific conditions.
- **Hygiene:** Map markers are good. Added "Item Storage PC" to avoid future confusion.
- **Goals:** Clear. Immediate focus is swapping Kenya for Togepi.
- **Strategy:** Pivot to manual Mail removal in Party Menu to resolve the PC deadlock.
- **Quest Info:** Rocket Uniform NOT needed (Crystal specific). Fight the Grunt at Radio Tower 2F.
- **Quest Info:** Showing Togepi to Elm awards Everstone (Side Quest).
- **Locked Door:** Underground (18, 6) needs a key. Remember this for later.
