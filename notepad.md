# Suicune Capture Strategy
- Start Turn: 47680
- Lead: XENON (Haunter, Lv44).
- Move 1: Hypnosis (Sleep).
- Move 2: Night Shade (44 dmg). Suicune has ~120 HP. Use twice for Red health.
- Item: Ultra Balls (32).
- Note: Suicune is Water type. Calcifer (Fire) is vulnerable. GORP (Snorlax) is a good tank.

# Strategic Plans: Locate Suicune
## The 'Beach Shortcut'
- Hypothesis: The northern plateau (Suicune at 7, 4) is reachable by walking North along the West beach at X=2.
- Route: 
  1. Jump ledge at (21, 46) to reach the southern corridor.
  2. Walk West through the gap at (5, 47) to reach the beach.
  3. Walk North along the sand (X=2) to Y=4.
- Status: Testing. Verifying if X=2 is clear past Y=10.

## The Great Spiral (Backup Plan)
- Entrance: (27, 44).
- Route: Lane 1 (N) -> Lane 2 (S) -> Lane 3 (S) -> Lane 4 (N) -> Lane 5 (N) -> Land at (14, 10).
- Requirements: Surf, Super Repel.

# Reflection Turn 48089
- Lesson: Fly menu is a linear list (Up/Down), not 2D.
- Lesson: Buoy maze logic is complex; verify land shortcuts first.
- Observation: (11, 15) is a dead end.
