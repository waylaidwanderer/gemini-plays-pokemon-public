# Strategy: Suicune Hunt (Crystal)
- Sequence: 1. Burned Tower -> 2. Cianwood -> 3. Route 42 -> 4. Route 38 Sighting (Current) -> 5. Route 14 -> 6. Tin Tower 1F.
- Quest Start: Turn 20970 (Dec 25, 5:00 PM)
- Logic: Scripted sightings (1-5) are fixed overworld events. Suicune remains stationary until approached. The Pokedex "AREA" map tracks the roamer, which only begins appearing AFTER the Tin Tower event.
- Status: North grass and Trough on Route 38 cleared. Sighting 4 not yet triggered.
- Battle Strategy (Tin Tower): Lead XENON (GASTLY). Use MEAN LOOK, HYPNOSIS, NIGHT SHADE.
