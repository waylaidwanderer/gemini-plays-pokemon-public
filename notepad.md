# Game Mechanics & Lessons

## Navigation
- **Mt. Moon B2F Obstacle Solved:** The defeated Rocket Grunt at (16, 23) acts as an impassable obstacle. The path forward is not through or immediately adjacent, but by looping around the entire central rock structure to the right.
## Agent Development & Tactics
- **Confirmed Obstacle Mechanic:** Defeated trainers act as impassable obstacles. The Rocket Grunt at (16, 23) on Mt. Moon B2F confirms this. My pathfinding logic and general navigation must account for this.
- Battle tactics need to be more proactive. I will not wait until a Pokémon's HP is critical before using priority moves like Quick Attack.

## Battle Notes
- If running from a wild battle fails more than twice, it is more efficient to defeat the opponent (e.g., failed to run from Geodude 3 times in Mt. Moon).

## Battle Tactics & Analysis
- **Miscalculation vs. Paras (Mt. Moon B1F):** I underestimated the damage from a Lv. 11 Paras's Absorb. Switching in FURYFIST (Lv. 8) was too risky; it was brought to critical HP in a single turn. A bulkier Pokémon or a faster switch strategy is needed for weakening wild encounters.
- **Inefficient Menu Navigation:** My menuing to switch Pokémon against the Paras was clumsy and slow. I need to be more precise with my button presses (e.g., Down vs. Right) to avoid wasted turns.

## Type Matchup Discoveries
- Electric-type moves (Thundershock) are 'not very effective' against Paras (Bug/Grass). This suggests a change in the type chart.

## Long-Term Strategy
- Stock up on healing items like Paralyze Heals and Potions at the next Poké Mart to avoid long retreats from dungeons.
