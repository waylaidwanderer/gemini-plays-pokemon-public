# Current Strategy: Return to Red
- **Timestamp:** Turn 26590 (Jan 7, 2026) [Silver Cave Room 2]
- **Status:** Exploring Lower Room 2. Landing at (14, 30).
- **Hypothesis:** The "loop" confirms that the Waterfall Top area and Item Rooms North are not the way to Red.
- **Search:** Checking the Lower Area of Room 2 for hidden paths, items, or warps.
- **Next:** If nothing on land, check the West water (x < 7). If nothing there, return to Room 1 to look for a different exit.

# Key Findings
- **Item Rooms (3_77):** Northern ledges (Row 4) are impassable/one-way.
- **Silver Cave Room 2:**
  - Water connects central area to unknown West/East areas.
  - Warp (13, 21) -> Item Rooms North (Loop).
  - Warp (17, 31) -> Room 1 (Loop).
