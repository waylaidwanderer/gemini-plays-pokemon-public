# General Lessons
- Pathfinding: Explore the perimeters of new areas to identify paths around obstacles.
- Battle: Wild Pokémon on Route 45 (Graveler, Geodude) yield high EXP but frequently use dangerous moves like Selfdestruct (Normal) or Magnitude (Ground).
- Strategy Insight: Xenon (Gastly) is immune to Selfdestruct (Normal-type).
- Type Matchups: Normal moves are NOT super effective against Rock; they are 0.5x effective. Trust the get_type_effectiveness tool. Ground moves are super effective against Fire. Rock/Ground types are immune to Electric (Thunderpunch).
- Milestone: Xenon reached Lv25 and evolved into HAUNTER (Turn 30625).
- Strategy: Continuing switch-training Xenon to Lv30 using Calcifer as the finisher.
- Turn 30649: Defeated wild Gligar (Lv24). Yielded 370 EXP (185 to Xenon).
- Turn 30655: Battling Hiker Parry (Onix Lv29). Strategy: Switch-train Xenon with Calcifer.
- Turn 30665: Defeated Hiker Parry (Onix Lv29). Received ¥1856. Xenon reached EXP: 12653. Strategy: Continuing south on Route 45.
