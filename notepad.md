# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Strategy: The Great Western Loop
The northern plateau (14, 10) is accessible via the western coastal corridor (X=2). This requires a long loop through the southern terrace gaps to bypass the central walls and elevation traps.

### Execution Plan
1. Western Highway Access: Navigate to Row 51 via the gap at X=12, Row 48.
2. Coastal Ascent: Walk north along X=2 to Row 12.
3. Trigger sighting: Walk east to (14, 10).

## Global Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Land (Traversable).
- WALL, BUOY, DOOR: Impassable.
- WATER: Requires Surf.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way North. Blocks DOWN movement (e.g., Row 50 at X=12-19; Row 48 at X=8-10).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way South. Blocks NORTH movement (e.g., 10, 15).

## Battle Plan: Eusine
- Roster: Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25).
- Strategy: Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion) Flamethrower sweep. Overleveled status ensures OHKOs.
- Backup: Gorp (Lv50 Snorlax) Body Slam.
