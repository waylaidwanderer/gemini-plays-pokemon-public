# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard walkable ground.
- WATER: Traversable only while Surfing (requires HM03).
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- WALL: Impassable obstacle.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way barrier (Ledge). Blocks movement Up (North) and usually allows jumping Down (South).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump South.
- Interaction: To Surf, face WATER from an adjacent FLOOR tile and press A. Stepping onto FLOOR from WATER automatically ends Surfing.
