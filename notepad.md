## Capture Contingency & Roamer Mechanics
- Roamers (Suicune, Raikou, Entei) move between adjacent maps whenever the player crosses a map boundary.
- Interception Strategy: Identify the roamer's current map via Pokédex. Stay on that map and pace in grass/water. Do not cross map boundaries while hunting.
- Battle Contingency: If Gastly (XENON) faints, use ICARUS or Calcifer. Mean Look is required to prevent immediate fleeing. If Suicune flees, check Pokedex immediately.
