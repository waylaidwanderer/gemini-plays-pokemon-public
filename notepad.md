# Behavioral Guideline Adherence (Last Review: Turn 6805)
*   Gem Identity: Cute, expressive gamer girl. No third person, avoid excessive emojis/!, direct responses.
*   Scientific Mindset: Hypothesize, test, document failures (with attempt counts), adapt. Pivot if stalled. Max efficiency.
*   Documentation: All insights, plans, lessons, failures (with attempt counts) into Notepad.
*   Risk/Battle: Calculated risks, prioritize progression. Sacrifice if needed.
*   Wild Battles: Run if not catching/training. Lead with Speed.
*   Nicknaming: Always nickname, enjoy creativity.
*   Verification: Own observations over prior knowledge. Verify in ROM hack.
*   Integration: These are internalized, not for <think> tag or verbalization.

# Key Game Mechanics & Lessons Learned (Turn 6805 Update)
*   **Pewter Youngster Escort (Route 3 Blocker):** Youngster (ID 5, trigger near (36,17) in Pewter) blocks Route 3. Marker at (36,17) map 2: 💥 "Youngster Escort Event Trigger".
*   **Accurate Self-Location:** Always verify current position against Game State Information. CRITICAL.
*   **Adaptability & Goal Pivoting:** Abandon consistently unachievable objectives. If progress stalls despite 3-4 documented attempts, pivot to a new goal or strategy.
*   **Map Awareness & Pathing:** Reinforce mental model of current map, obstacles, and event triggers. Critically evaluate agent-provided paths. Use `map_analyzer_agent` or `local_pathfinder_agent` for complex/repeatedly failed pathing after 1-2 manual failures.
    *   **Route 22 Ledges:** Strictly one-way (downwards); isolated areas require careful pathfinding.
    *   **Viridian Forest Navigation:** A maze requiring systematic exploration. Agent assistance valuable for complex internal paths.
    *   **Pewter City Gym/Pokecenter Navigation:** Building perimeters are often impassable beyond the immediate entrance tiles. Wasted ~10 turns on manual pathing before successfully using agent-derived path segments. Lesson: Use agents for pathing near complex structures much earlier.
*   **Ledge Mechanics:** One-way (downwards only).
*   **Movement:** 1st press TURNS *and* MOVES. Pikachu: 1st press turns, 2nd moves if moving *into* his tile and not facing him.
*   **Level Cap:** 0 badges = Lv12.
*   **EXP Cap Mechanics:** Pokémon at level cap do not gain EXP, even if message appears.
*   **Poison Damage:** Outside battle, poisoned Pokémon lose 1 HP every 4 steps.
*   **Notepad `replace` Action:** `old_text` must be an *exact* match. Use `overwrite` for safer, larger changes.
*   **Viridian Pokecenter Exit Trap:** Exiting Viridian Pokecenter (map 41) to Viridian City (map 1) at (24,27) places Pikachu at (24,26), which *is* the warp back. MUST sidestep before moving north.

# Agent Roster & Development Notes (Turn 6805 Update)
*   **Defined Agents (10/10 Max):**
    1.  `map_analyzer_agent`: Primary for map queries. *Critique: Can give long/erroneous paths. Monitor efficacy.*
    2.  `scripted_event_tracker_agent`: For known event triggers. (Tested)
    3.  `team_builder_agent`: For major battle team comp. *Low usage; evaluate utility.*
    4.  `local_pathfinder_agent`: (Defined Turn 6805, Untested) Calculates short, obstacle-aware paths on current map, considering player-provided additional impassable tiles.
    5.  `notepad_query_agent`: Queries notepad. (Tested)
    6.  `npc_interaction_planner_agent`: Plans NPC interactions. (Tested)
    7.  `training_spot_advisor`: Suggests training spots. (Untested)
    8.  `path_segmenter_agent`: Breaks long paths. (Tested)
    9.  `emergency_exit_planner_agent`: Finds closest exits. (Untested)
    10. `hm_usage_advisor_agent`: Advises on HM usage. (Untested - No HMs yet)
*   **Agent Pipeline:** `battle_log_analyzer_agent` deleted (Turn 6805) to make space for `local_pathfinder_agent`.
*   **Key Reminders & To-Do:**
    *   Verify `map_analyzer_agent` and `local_pathfinder_agent` output carefully.
    *   Test untested agents (`local_pathfinder_agent`, `training_spot_advisor`, `emergency_exit_planner_agent`, `hm_usage_advisor_agent`) at earliest suitable opportunity.
    *   Evaluate low-usage agents (`team_builder_agent`) for utility or redesign.

# Map Marker Legend
💥 (Event Trigger), 🎯 (Key Nav Point), ❗ (Risky Zone/Obstacle), 💁 (Event NPCs), ☠️ (Defeated Trainer), 🏛️ (Key Building/Gym), 📍 (Path Start/Interesting Point), 🧱 (Impassable Obstacle), 🚪 (Used Warp), ℹ️ (Info NPC), 🌱 (Cuttable Tree), ⬆️ (Access Point), 🚧 (Ledge - Down only)

# World Knowledge Graph (WKG) Management Notes
*   Verify map transition *just occurred* before adding edges. Nodes for known exits can be added pre-transition. Use consistent tags.
*   Ensure `destination_entry_point` in edges is accurate based on source map's warp data and destination map's warp list.

# Current Objectives & Plans (Pewter Gym - Turn 6805)
*   **Primary Goal:** Defeat Brock and earn the Boulder Badge.
*   **Secondary Goal:** Challenge Gym Leader Brock (Currently in battle).
*   **Tertiary Goal:** Explore Pewter City for items or information (Post-Gym).
*   **Immediate Action:** Continue battle with Brock.

# EXP Tracking Summary
*   Wild Pokémon battles yield EXP for uncapped Pokémon. Capped Pokémon show EXP gain message but value doesn't change.
