# General Lessons
- Scripted Events: Sightings are sprite-based. If a sprite is missing, the event cannot trigger. [Turn 22217]
- Ecruteak Geography: NW = Burned Tower; NE = Barrier Station (leads to Tin Tower). Wise Trio is in Barrier Station. [Turn 22217]
- Root Hypothesis Failure: If a scripted sequence stalls (e.g., Suicune sightings), the assumed order or prerequisite might be wrong. Pivot to the next major hurdle (Wise Trio battle) instead of looping. [Turn 22321]

# Strategy: Suicune Hunt (Crystal Version)
- Sighting 1: Burned Tower (Complete)
- Sighting 2: Cianwood City (Complete)

- Sighting 3 & 4: Route 42 Island & Route 36 Junction.
