# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026
- Current Location: National Park (Map 3_15)

### Immediate Goals
1. **Find Floria**: Explore the North-East corner of the National Park.
2. **Find Exit to Route 36**: Likely in the North-East.
3. **Get SquirtBottle**: Return to Flower Shop after finding Floria.

### Quest Log
- **Badges**: Zephyr, Hive, Plain.
- **Party**: All Healthy (Garnet Poisoned).
- **Mail Quest**: Active.
- **Contest**: Not entered (lack of Sport Balls/Bug Catching logic).

### Strategic Notes
- **Poison Alert**: Garnet is poisoned. No Antidote in bag. Prioritize reaching a Pokemon Center (Violet City East?) or finding Floria quickly.
- **SquirtBottle**: Requires Plain Badge (Have), inspecting tree (Done), and finding Floria.
- **Map Intel**: "North Gate" at (25,3) was invalid. Heading South-East to find the East Exit (Route 36).
### Reflection (Turn 11576)
- **Map Update**: Route 35 path North blocked by trees at (16,6) and Trainer at (17,7).
- **Navigation**: Must go West (Left) to bypass the tree line at Row 6.
- **Hypothesis**: Map 10_2 (Route 35) connects Left/Right sides at the North end.
- **Plan**: Navigate West to (3,6) to investigate the Gatehouse/Exit at (3,5) and cross to the Left side.
- **Status**: Garnet Poisoned (54 HP). Urgency: High.
- **Discrepancy**: GameState reports position (17,7) but Screen shows (16,7). Trusting Screen/Logic.
