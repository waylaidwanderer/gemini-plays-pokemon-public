# Gem's Playbook (Post-Critique)

## Core Strategy & Goals
- My goals are managed by the system, not listed here. I will focus on achieving the current primary goal.

## Strategic Learnings & Hypotheses
- **Source of Truth:** The Game State information is the ONLY source of truth. My memory and notepad can be flawed. I must verify all critical information (e.g., badges) against the game state before acting.
- **Hypothesis Correction (Brock):** I previously believed I had defeated Brock, which was a hallucination. The actual trigger to progress past the NPC on Route 3 is *obtaining* the Boulder Badge, not just winning the fight. I am currently re-fighting Brock to earn the badge.
- **Tool Usage:** I will use `pathfinder_agent` only for complex navigation. Manual pathing is better for simple routes.
- **Battle Prep:** I will re-order my party before major battles to lead with the most advantageous Pokémon.
