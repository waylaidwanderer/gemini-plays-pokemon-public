# Strategy: The Suicune Pursuit
- **Quest Started:** Turn #50620 (Cianwood City)
- **Status:** All boulders cleared. Phase 1 complete.
- **Phase 2: Reaching the Sighting Spot**
  - Target: (14, 10) in northern Cianwood.
  - Path A: Use the warp at (5, 17) labeled "Suicune Sighting Area Entrance".
  - Path B: If Path A fails, use the far-left corridor (X=0 to 2) to walk north to Row 10, then East to (14, 10).
  - Path C: Surf around the wall at Row 15 (requires going to X=23).
  - Note: Be prepared for Eusine battle immediately after Suicune bolts.

# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard traversable terrain.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable terrain.
- WATER: Traversable only with Surf.
- DOOR / WARP_CARPET: Map transition points.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Allows jumping down (South) but blocks movement from the opposite direction (North).
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Slopes that allow movement in specific directions (e.g., North/West) but block others.
- COUNTER: Blocks movement; interact from an adjacent tile.
- ROCK (Object): Blocks movement; can be cleared with Rock Smash.

# Lessons Learned
- **Cianwood Pathing:** (11, 15) leads to a dead-end pocket at (11, 14). Do not use.
- **Menu Navigation:** The "Switch items?" confirmation box is modal; B button does not close it. Use A on NO to exit.
- **Fly Map:** Cursor positions: New Bark (East), Cherrygrove (West), Violet (North), Azalea (South), Goldenrod (West/North), Olivine (West), Cianwood (Far West).
- **Coordinates:** Notepad coordinates refer to the internal map grid, not Fly Map cursor.
- **Suicune Spot:** (14, 10) in Cianwood City. Requires Rock Smash at (4, 19) and (8, 16) to reach. [Verified - Advisor]
- **Annotation Alert:** Ignore overworld coordinate labels while on the Fly map.
