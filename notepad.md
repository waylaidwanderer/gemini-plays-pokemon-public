# Suicune Quest (Crystal) - PROGRESS
- Milestone 1-4: Burned Tower, Cianwood, Route 42, Route 36 sightings complete.
- Milestone 5: Tin Tower battle engaged (per summary Part 4).
- Status: Roaming (Tracking movements across routes 37, 42, 38, 44).
- Note: Clear Bell is still in inventory. Suicune is NOT caught.

## Strategy
1. Visit Tin Tower in Ecruteak City. Since the Clear Bell is still in my bag, I need to see if Suicune is still there or if the event triggered its roaming phase.
2. If Suicune is not at Tin Tower, use the Pokedex AREA map to track it to Route 42 or 38.
3. Lead with XENON (Gastly) to use Mean Look and Hypnosis.
