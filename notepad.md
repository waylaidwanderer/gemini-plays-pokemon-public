- **Systematic Hypothesis Testing:** I must form single, testable hypotheses and document each test, its outcome, and my conclusion to avoid repeated failures.
- **Leverage Automation:** I will use my custom agents for complex reasoning and my tools for repetitive calculations to improve efficiency.
