## Battle Strategy (Blackthorn Gym)
- Leader Clair: Dragonair Lv37 x3, Kingdra Lv40.
- Strategy: Typhlosion (Lv45) with Thunderpunch and Graveler (Lv44) with Earthquake.
- Backup: Catch Jynx (Rare) or Swinub (Common) in Ice Path for Ice-type moves. Strategy advisor confirms level advantage but warns of Graveler's 4x Water weakness.

## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Walkable. NOTE: B1F floor tiles do NOT slide. B2F floor tiles (non-islands) DO slide.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Needs Surf (HM03).
- ICE: Sliding mechanic. B2F only. Moving onto ICE causes sliding until hitting non-ICE, wall, or object.
- PIT: Warp to B2F. Dropping a boulder fills the pit on B2F, creating a "stopper" tile.
- BOULDER: Pushable with Strength (HM04). Resets to start position when changing floors via ladder or pit.
- STRENGTH: Must be re-activated after every floor transition or battle.
