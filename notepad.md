# Strategy: Goldenrod City
- **Objective**: Collect Johto Badges.
- **Method**: Challenge Whitney at the Goldenrod Gym.
- **Whitney Gym Strategy**: 
    - Use GNEISS (Geodude) to resist Normal/Rock moves.

    - Teach TM31 (Mud-Slap) to reduce Miltank's accuracy.

## Radio Tower 2F Map Transitions
- RadioTower2F (15, 0) <-> RadioTower1F (15, 0).
- Stairs to 3F at (0, 0) in RadioTower2F (Blocked by guard).

## GNEISS Training Strategy (Whitney Prep)
- **Moveset**: Teach TM04 (Rollout). It's a powerful STAB move that can sweep.
- **Held Item**: Equip HARD STONE to boost Rock-type move power.
- **Training**: Grind on Route 35 tall grass. Avoid Grass-types (Oddish) due to 4x weakness.
- **Goal**: Reach Lv 18-20 for Whitney. Magnitude is learned at Lv 16.
- **Time Tracking**: Started training at Turn 3932.
- **Stagnation recognized**: Menu navigation for TM04/Hard Stone has failed repeatedly due to persistent cursor positions.
- **Strategy Shift**: All menu navigation now includes a robust reset sequence (multiple 'Up' presses to guarantee starting at POKEDEX). This ensures reliable access to the PACK and other menus regardless of previous state.

# Menu Mechanics
- **Start Menu Wraps**: Pressing `Down` on EXIT (index 7) moves the cursor to POKEDEX (index 0). Pressing `Up` on POKEDEX moves it to EXIT. This means `Up*8` does not reset the cursor to a fixed position; it returns it to the starting point.
- **Persistent Cursor**: The Start menu and Pack pockets remember the last cursor position.
- **Current Start Menu Cursor**: Last seen on SAVE (index 5) at Turn 3964.
- **Current Pack Cursor**: Last seen on CUT (HM01) in the TM pocket at Turn 3964.

## GNEISS (Geodude) Info
- **Held Item**: BERRY (Needs to be swapped for HARD STONE).
