# Roamer Hunt Log
- **Status:** In Route 37 Grass.
- **Action:** Quick Check (Running through grass without Repel to save menuing time).
- **Strategy:**
  1. Walk through grass (Down x4).
  2. If encounter:
     - Roamer: Try to catch/battle.
     - Trash: Run.
  3. If no encounter, return to Ecruteak.
  4. Repeat shuffle.
- **Note:** I lack a Trapper (Mean Look), so catching is hard. Focus on locating first.
