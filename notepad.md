# Johto Journey - Final Phase

## Strategy: Preparing for the Elite Four
- Training: Level all active members (especially XENON and Ouroboros) to 45+ at Route 45 or Route 27.
- Coverage: Dragonite (Ouroboros) is the primary candidate for Ice-type coverage (TM33) against Lance.
- Route: Surf east from New Bark Town to Route 27 once preparations are complete.
- Fast Travel: Swap Ravioli (KRABBY) for ICARUS (PIDGEY) to use Fly. [Completed Turn 35719]

## Game Mechanics: FLY Map
- Navigation: Pressing 'Down' cycles through visited locations in a predetermined list order.
- Outdoor Use Only: FLY can only be used when the player is outdoors.

## Area Mechanics: National Park (Bug-Catching Contest)
- Timing: Thursday only. 20-minute time limit.
- Rules: 20 Park Balls provided. Only the lead Pokémon participates.
- Retention: Only the last Pokémon caught is kept.
- Start Time: 8:23 PM (Thursday).

## Contest Scoring Criteria
- Formula: Level + (Remaining HP / Max HP) * 100 + Base Stat Total factor.
- Tiers: Scyther and Pinsir are top tier. Higher level and full HP are best.
- Winning: 1st place typically requires 300-350+ points.

## Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- GRASS: Traversable; triggers encounters.
- WATER: Traversable (Surf).
- WALL/BUOY/HEADBUTT_TREE: Impassable.
- WHIRLPOOL: Requires HM06.
- LADDER/STAIRS/DOOR/CAVE: Warps.
- LEDGE/LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (South).
- COUNTER: Interaction possible from adjacent tile.

## Lessons Learned
- Dragon Shrine Entrance: South side (19, 29).
- Fly: Use 'Down' to cycle cities.
- **Move Compatibility (CRITICAL):**
  - XENON (Haunter), Calcifer (Typhlosion), Ouroboros (Dratini) CANNOT learn TM33 Ice Punch.
  - Verified in-game; ignore external advice.

## Pokemon Info
- Ouroboros (DRATINI): Lv15. ExtremeSpeed (Gift).

## Battle Strategies
- Bug-Catching Contest: Use Hypnosis. Avoid damaging low-level targets with Night Shade (Lv37 damage). Night Shade deals damage equal to the user's level. Confuse Ray is a secondary option if Hypnosis misses. Catching at full HP is prioritized for higher contest scores.
