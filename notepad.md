# Suicune Capture Strategy
## Strategy: The Mean Look Pivot
1. Catch a Gastly in Sprout Tower (Night only, Lv 3-6).
2. Train Gastly to Lv 13 to learn Mean Look.
3. Evolve to Haunter (Lv 25) to ensure Base 95 Speed (Suicune is Base 85).
4. Track Suicune using Pokedex AREA map.
5. Lead with Haunter: Mean Look (Turn 1) -> Hypnosis -> Great Balls.

## Global Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard traversable tile.
- TALL_GRASS: Standard encounter tile.
- WALL/HEADBUTT_TREE: Impassable.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT: One-way movement.
- WARP_CARPET_RIGHT/DOWN: Map transition.
- WATER: Traversable with HM SURF.
- ICE: Sliding movement.
- COUNTER: Interaction point for NPCs; impassable.
- LADDER: Vertical map transition; traversable.
- NPC: Map objects that block movement.

## Sprout Tower Analysis
- Layout: Middle section (x=5 to x=14) is isolated. Access outer ring via 2F ladders.
- Encounters: FLOOR tiles at (14, 6), (10, 11), and (14, 10) are safe zones. (6, 5) on 2F is a valid encounter tile.
- Sweet Scent: Triggers immediate encounters on valid tiles. "Nothing here" means safe tile.

## Battle Observations
- XENON (Gastly) caught at Lv 6 (Female) at Turn #13924. Sent to Bill's PC.

## Training Plan: XENON
1. (Done) Retrieve XENON from Bill's PC.
2. (Done) Deposit Blarney (Sudowoodo) to make room.
3. Heal party at Violet Pokecenter.
4. Train XENON to Lv 13 (Mean Look) and then to Lv 25 (Haunter).
## Training Session Tracking
- Turn #13969: Training session for XENON started.
- Target: Level 13 (Mean Look), then Level 25 (Haunter).
- Location: Route 32 (Grass).
## Route 32 Observations
- Ledge at (14, 6): Type FLOOR_UP_WALL. Blocked movement from (14, 5) to (14, 6) when attempting to go Down. Ledges may have specific entry rules or directions.
