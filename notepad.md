# Hall of Fame Entry
- **Achievement:** **CHAMPION OF THE JOHTO LEAGUE!**
- **Date:** Turn 33314
- **MVP:** Muscle (Machoke) Lv88.

# Reflection (Turn 34940)
- **Strategy Pivot:** Fly map navigation failed consistently. Switched to Magnet Train (Saffron City) to return to Johto. This is a deterministic path.
- **Lesson Learned:** Verification is key. Assumed Viridian Mart sold Repels; was wrong. Wasted turns. Future shopping needs verification or reliable hubs (Goldenrod/Celadon).
- **Current State:** Leaving Viridian Mart empty-handed. Heading to Saffron via Diglett's Cave.

# Roamer Hunt Log
- **Session Start:** Turn 34090.
- **Plan:** Check Clerk at (13, 5) (Top Clerk) for Super/Max Repels -> Fly to Ecruteak -> Hunt.
- **Note:** Clerk at (13, 6) (Bottom Clerk) only sells standard Repels. Viridian & Vermilion had none.
- **Pattern:** Circle grass (16 steps) -> Shuffle Ecruteak -> Repeat.
- **Lead:** Gyarados (Lv36) < Roamer (Lv40). Repel works.
- **Last Sighting:** Route 38 & Route 42 (Verified Turn 34605).
