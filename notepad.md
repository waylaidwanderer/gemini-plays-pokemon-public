# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
## Strategy: The Great Cianwood Trek
Reach (14, 10) by navigating a complex series of internal corridors.
1. Move East to (14, 33) and North to (14, 26).
2. Move West through gaps at (10, 26) and (5, 26) to (4, 26).
3. Move South along X=4 to (4, 21) and West to (2, 21).
4. Walk North along X=2 to Row 12 (bypasses Row 15 ledge).
5. Walk East along Row 12 to (14, 12) and North to (14, 10).
- Current Step: Navigating to (14, 26) via X=14 corridor.
