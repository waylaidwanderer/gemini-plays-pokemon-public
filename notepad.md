## Route 29 Navigation
- **Westbound Blockade:** Trees at x=37 (y=12-15). Bypass: Go south to y=16.
- **Ledge Blockade (West):** Path at x=21 blocked by CUT_TREE.
- **Dead Ends:** Lower path ends at x=14. Corridor at x=49 (North) is a dead end.
- **Ledge Puzzle Solution:**
  1. From start (East), go South to y=16 to bypass trees.
  2. Go West to x=31 Gap.
  3. Go North through gap to y=11.
  4. Go East behind ledges to x=42.
  5. Go North to y=8, then West to Cherrygrove.

- Youngster at (27, 16): Tips about grass.
