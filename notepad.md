## To-Do List

## Discoveries & Mechanics
- Some trees are 'HEADBUTT_TREE' type, likely for the move Headbutt.
- **Dialogue Triggers:** Some dialogues (like Professor Elm's initial errand speech) might loop until another specific NPC in the room is spoken to. In Elm's Lab, talking to the scientist was required to progress the conversation with Elm.

## World Knowledge & NPCs
- **Route 29:** The northern path is blocked by one-way ledges. The southern path is blocked by an impassable Youngster at (27, 16) who does not respond to interaction from any angle.
- **New Bark Town:** A Fisher at (12, 9) mentioned Prof. Elm discovered new Pokémon.
