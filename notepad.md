# Strategy: Suicune Hunt (Crystal)
- Sequence: 1. Burned Tower (Done) -> 2. Cianwood (Done) -> 3. Route 42 Island (Current) -> 4. Route 38 -> 5. Route 14 -> 6. Tin Tower 1F.
- Progress:
    - Sighting 1 (Burned Tower): Done.
    - Sighting 2 (Cianwood): Turn 20088. Approached at (10, 14), it fled.
    - Eusine Battle (Cianwood): Turn 20110. Won.
    - Clear Bell: Obtained Turn 21217.
    - Sighting 3 (Route 42): 
        - Island Sweep started Turn 21330. Visited ALL island FLOOR tiles (Turn 21330-21340). Sprite did NOT appear.
        - Map reset via Mt. Mortar at Turn 21349.
        - Current Task: Verify Pokedex AREA map to see if sighting triggered silently.
- Lessons Learned:
    - Pokedex Navigation: Alphabetical (A-Z). Suicune is after Sudowoodo.
    - Scripted vs Roaming: Suicune is scripted until Sighting 5. Pokedex "AREA" dot is reliable.
    - Menu Stagnation: Do not loop in menus. Use tools/agents.
