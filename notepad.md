# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Current Status
- **Location**: Cianwood City (22_7), Inside House at (2, 7).
- **Navigation Strategy**: Exit this house (Medicine Shop). Search the building south of the Gym (Cianwood Pharmacy). Heal at Pokémon Center.
- **Reflection**: The house at (15, 47) was a Medicine Shop, not the Pharmacy.
- **Party**: Garnet (Lvl 40, Injured), Headache (Surf).
- **Quest**: Obtain Mineral Badge (Jasmine).

### Objectives
- **Primary**: Obtain Mineral Badge (Jasmine).
- **Secondary**: Get SecretPotion (Cianwood).
- **Tertiary**: Train Basil to Lvl 21.

### Notes
- **Cianwood Pharmacy**: Supposed to have the SecretPotion.
- **Gym**: Chuck (Fighting Type). Weak to Psychic/Flying. Requires Strength for boulders (HM04 is in Olivine Café - missed it!). Will need to backtrack to Olivine to get HM04 before challenging Chuck if boulders block the path.
- **Return Trip**: Will need to climb Olivine Lighthouse again.
- **Moomoo Farm**: Needs Berries.
