# Strategic Notes
## Objectives
- **Primary:** Reach Indigo Plateau (Money Farming Loop).
- **Secondary:** Defeat Elite Four.
- **Tertiary:** Hunt Roamers (Raikou/Entei) - *Paused*.

## Current Task: Traverse Victory Road 1F (South -> East)
- **Location:** Victory Road 1F (West Section) at (0, 49).
- **Goal:** Reach East Section via South Corridor.
- **Route:** `(0, 49) -> (2, 57) -> (7, 57) -> (7, 54) -> (15, 54) -> (17, 56) -> North`.
- **Reasoning:**
  - 2F West path seems dead-ended or bugged at ledge (3, 34).
  - 1F has a southern corridor (Row 54/56/57) connecting West and East sections.
  - Avoiding potential blockage at (6, 56) by using Row 57.

## Status
- **Money:** ¥3294.
- **Party:** Gyarados (Lead), Lugia, Machoke, Pidgey, Oddish, Quilava.
