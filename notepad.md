### Game Info
- **Time**: Monday Morning.
- **TYPE_4e8c**: Water (Impassable).
- **TYPE_a339/a336**: Ledges (One-way South). Exclude from Northbound navigation.
- Met Sticker fanatics at National Park South Entrance (10,41) & (11,41). They have printed stickers.
- Girl at (17, 39) warned about grass. Quick Claw lady not found on bench at (22, 40). Bench was empty.

- Apricorn Trees on Route 37: (13, 5) 🔴 Red, (16, 5) 🔵 Blue. Black was harvested earlier.
- Navigation:
  - Route 37 has two lanes separated by trees (x=10-11).
  - Left Lane (x<10): Main Path to Ecruteak (North).
  - Right Lane (x>11): Apricorn Grove (Dead End North).
- **Observation**: Select button swapping failed in Party Menu. Will use 'A' -> 'SWITCH' method.
- **Observation**: `advance_dialogue` caused a loop with Eusine. Using 'B' presses to escape.
- **Hypothesis**: The tile (13, 12) might be a trigger for Eusine's dialogue, causing a loop. Attempting to move UP to break it.
- **Observation**: Row 11 is a rock wall blocking the center (x=5 to x=12). Must use side paths (x=3 or x=13) to proceed North.
- **Plan**: Taking the Left path (x=3) to explore the northern section.
- **Observation**: Access to the top right requires traversing Row 1 (North Corridor) to bypass rock walls at x=6.
- **Hypothesis**: The path to the Rival is Entrance -> Left -> North -> East -> South -> Center.
- **Correction**: Accidentally entered Fight menu. Backing out to switch to Topaz properly.
- **Menu Path**: B (Exit Fight) -> Right (PKMN) -> A -> Down x4 (Topaz) -> A (Switch).
- **Strategy**: 
  - **Status**: Topaz (Lv 15) vs Croconaw (Lv 22). Garnet (54/88) is safe in back.
  - **Tactics**: 
    1. Topaz uses **Sand-Attack**. Goal: -2 Accuracy.
    2. Topaz can tank ~2 hits (Water Gun/Bite do ~18 dmg).
    3. If Topaz faints, Garnet comes in to clean up.
  - **Note**: Croconaw has -1 Accuracy from Smokescreen already. -2 or -3 makes him very unreliable.
