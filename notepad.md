## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- LADDER: Floor change (e.g. 1F to B1F).
- COUNTER: Face and press A to interact.
- LEDGE: Semi-traversable (jump down).
- WATER: Requires SURF.
- WHIRLPOOL: Requires WHIRLPOOL.
- WATERFALL: Requires WATERFALL.

## Active Quest: Find Granddaughter [Started Turn 37715]
- Clues: Granddaughter is missing; sailor on B1F looking for buddy.
- Strategy: Explore western B1F to find the Captain's cabin. The granddaughter should be there.
- Lesson: Corridors blocked by NPCs (like sailors) often require finding a trigger NPC (like a "buddy" goofing off) to clear the path.

## Kanto Strategy
- Target 1: Lt. Surge (Vermilion City).
- MVP: GNEISS (Graveler) Lv 51. Ground-type immunity to Electric.

## Lessons Learned
- S.S. Aqua sailors block corridors; they "shadow" movements if not triggered to move.
- Super Nerd (26, 9) blocks the x=26 corridor on B1F.
- Map transitions reset NPC positions.
- Path to western 1F is likely via B1F (East 1F -> East B1F -> West B1F -> West 1F).
