### Strategic Reflection (Turn 8719)
- **Status**: Stuck in Goldenrod for ~100 turns.
- **Issue**: Oscillating between East/West without clearing the "fog of war".
- **Insight**: The North-East (Flower Shop) is a cul-de-sac. The Central North Wall seems solid. The only remaining option is the North-West quadrant, which is largely "unseen".
- **Action Plan**: 
    1. Return to Main Street (y=10).
    2. Move West to x=6.
    3.Systematically explore North from there, hugging the West edge.

### Navigation Notes
- **Location**: Goldenrod City (Central - West Side).
- **Goal**: Reach Route 35 Gatehouse (North Exit).
- **Status**: At (8, 8). Moving West to inspect the wall at x=5.
- **Plan**: 
    1. Move to (6, 8).
    2. Inspect (5, 8) and (5, 7).
    3. Move North to (6, 5) to inspect the area West of the Game Corner.
- **Hypothesis**: A path North exists along the x=5 line, or the Game Corner has a side entrance.

### Quest Chain: SquirtBottle
1. **Defeat Whitney**: Done (Plain Badge obtained).
2. **Find Floria**: Currently seeking at Route 36.
3. **Get Bottle**: Return to Flower Shop after meeting Floria.

### Key Locations
- **Game Corner**: (9, 5).
- **Target**: (5, 8).
