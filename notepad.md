# Key Game Mechanics & Lessons Learned (Turn 7021 Update)
*   **EXP Cap Mechanics:** Pok√©mon at level cap do not gain EXP, even if message appears. Badge earned mid-battle doesn't retroactively apply EXP if capped at battle start.
*   **Pikachu Movement:** 1st press turns, 2nd moves if moving *into* his tile and not facing him.
*   **Level Caps:** 0 badges = Lv12. 1 badge = Lv21.
*   **Poison Damage:** Outside battle, 1 HP every 4 steps.
*   **Notepad `replace` Action:** `old_text` must be an *exact* match. Use `overwrite` for safer, larger changes.
*   **Viridian Pokecenter Exit Trap:** Exiting Viridian Pokecenter (map 41) to Viridian City (map 1) at (24,27) places Pikachu at (24,26) (warp back). MUST sidestep.
*   **Pewter City - Route 3 Access (East):** The eastern exit of Pewter City leads directly to Route 3 (East of Pewter).
*   **Ledge Mechanics:** One-way (downwards only). Cannot step *up* onto a ledge tile from a ground tile one Y-level below it, nor step directly onto a ledge from an adjacent ground tile at the same Y-level.
*   **Dialogue Loops:** If 'A' or 'B' presses fail to advance dialogue or initiate battle after 2-3 attempts, abandon interaction, mark NPC, and move on. Do not repeat failed interaction attempts.
*   **Map Transition Variance:** Exiting a map from different adjacent edge tiles can lead to different arrival coordinates on the destination map. Must test alternative edge tiles if the initial one leads to an undesired area.

# Agent Roster & Development Notes (Turn 7021 Update)
*   **Defined Agents (10/10 Max):** `map_analyzer_agent`, `scripted_event_tracker_agent`, `team_builder_agent`, `local_pathfinder_agent` (Tested), `notepad_query_agent` (Tested), `npc_interaction_planner_agent` (Tested), `training_spot_advisor` (Untested), `path_segmenter_agent` (Tested), `emergency_exit_planner_agent` (Tested), `hm_usage_advisor_agent` (Untested - No HMs yet).
*   **Agent Usage Reflection:**
    *   Pathfinding agents (`local_pathfinder_agent`, `map_analyzer_agent`) should be used promptly after 1-2 manual pathing failures, especially in complex areas. Service unavailability has been an issue.
    *   Untested agents (`training_spot_advisor`, `hm_usage_advisor_agent`) should be tested when relevant opportunities arise. `training_spot_advisor` could be useful on Route 3 or Mt. Moon.
    *   Consider deleting less frequently used agents if a new agent slot is critically needed.
*   **Key Reminders & To-Do:** Verify agent outputs. Test untested agents. Be more proactive with pathfinding agents if they are functional.

# Map Marker Legend
üí• (Event Trigger), üéØ (Key Nav Point), ‚ùó (Problematic NPC/Obstacle), üíÅ (Event NPCs), ‚ò†Ô∏è (Defeated Trainer), üèõÔ∏è (Key Building/Gym), üìç (Path Start/Interesting Point), üß± (Impassable Obstacle), üö™ (Used Warp), ‚ÑπÔ∏è (Info NPC), üå± (Cuttable Tree), ‚¨ÜÔ∏è (Access Point), üöß (Ledge - Down only)

# World Knowledge Graph (WKG) Management Notes
*   Verify map transition *just occurred* before adding edges. Nodes for known exits can be added pre-transition. Use consistent tags.
*   Ensure `destination_entry_point` in edges is accurate.

# EXP Tracking Summary (Post-Brock)
*   SPBARKY (Pikachu, Lv12 -> Lv14): Gained EXP after Brock, now 2851 EXP.
*   ODDISH (Oddish, Lv12): 973 EXP (Gained 277 EXP from Onix, but was capped for Geodude EXP). Still Lv12.
*   FLAREE (Vulpix, Lv7 -> Lv10): Gained significant EXP on Route 3, now 1233 EXP.
*   Lesson: EXP gain messages can be misleading if Pok√©mon was capped at the start of battle, even if a badge raises the cap mid-battle. Actual EXP is applied later or not at all for the capped portion.

# Encounter Issues & Stalled Progress (Route 3 - Documented Loops)
*   **Cool Trainer F (ID 4) at (17,10) on Route 3:** Dialogue loop ("Quit staring if you don't want to fight!"). Multiple failed attempts (approx. 5+ across turns 6905-6912). Marked with ‚ùó. **Status: Abandoned.**
*   **Youngster (ID 2) at (11,7) on Route 3:** Dialogue loop ('than those found in the forest!'). 7 failed attempts (turns 6932-6936, 6938, 6940). Marked with ‚ùó. **Status: Abandoned.**
*   **Youngster (ID 3) at (15,5) on Route 3:** Dialogue loop ('when your box is full!'). 6 failed attempts (turns 6946-6948, 6950-6951, 6952). Marked with ‚ùó. **Status: Abandoned.**
*   **Youngster (ID 5) / BUG CATCHER at (20,6) on Route 3:** Battle Won. Post-battle dialogue loop ('If a POK√©MON BOX...') for 10+ turns (6973-6987). Marked as defeated (‚ò†Ô∏è). **Status: Battle Won, dialogue loop problematic.**

# Route 3 Navigation Update (Turn 7051, Updated Turn 7056)
*   **Pewter City East Exits:** Confirmed that all tested eastern edge tiles in Pewter City ((40,17), (40,18), (40,19), (40,20)) lead to the *lower path* of Route 3. The upper path is not accessible via these specific exits.
*   **Current Strategy for Upper Path Access:** Intra-map navigation on Route 3 is the primary method to access different elevations. Avoid assuming inter-map travel is needed unless all intra-map options are exhausted.

# Route 3 Exploration Update (Turn 7082)
*   **Current Focus:** Exploring eastern Route 3. Currently at (20,10) in dialogue with Youngster (ID 7) at (21,10).
*   **Unseen Tiles (26,5), (26,6):** Still listed as reachable. However, defeated trainers LASS (ID 6 at 21,5) and Youngster (ID 5 at 20,6) block direct access on the upper plateau (Y=5, Y=6).
*   **Revised Strategy for Unseen Tiles:** After dealing with Youngster (ID 7), will attempt to find an alternative path to the upper plateau (Y=5, Y=6) to access (26,5) and (26,6). If no clear path is found due to NPC blockages, will prioritize reaching Mt. Moon.

# Route 3 Navigation Lessons (Turn 7077)
*   **Defeated Trainers Impassable:** Confirmed after multiple attempts (movement, stun tool) that defeated trainers (e.g., LASS at (21,5), Youngster at (20,6) on Route 3) act as impassable obstacles, even if their tile is 'ground'. This contradicts initial assumptions about 'ground (occupied by...)' tiles being traversable.
