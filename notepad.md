# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
## Strategy: Great Southern Loop (Land Route)
To reach the northern plateau (14, 10), Gem must enter the Western Corridor (X=0-2) which bypasses the Row 15 ledge. Due to nested walls at X=3, 5, 9, the first land-based entry to the Western Corridor is at Row 51.

## Execution Plan
1. Move to (12, 49) via X=12 thoroughfare (bypasses X=9/11 walls and Row 34/46/48 ledges via gaps at 12, 34 and 12, 48).
2. Move to (10, 51) via Row 50 gap at (10, 50).
3. Move West to (2, 51) and North along Western Corridor (X=2) to Row 12.
4. Move East to (14, 12) and North to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune sighting.
