# Route 3 Navigation Plan
- **Current Position:** Route 3 (Lower Path).
- **Insight:** Route 3 has two distinct paths separated by walls from Pewter City:
    1. **Upper Path** (Enter from Pewter at y=14): Leads to Mt. Moon Entrance (Row 1).
    2. **Lower Path** (Enter from Pewter at y=18): Leads to blocked areas/dead ends.
- **Correction:** I am currently on the Lower Path. I must return to Pewter City and switch to the Upper Path.
- **Plan:**
  1. Return to Pewter City (Walk Left).
  2. Explored North (Rows 1-11): Blocked by walls/ledges. Found Berry Trees.
  3. Conclusion: The exit at Row 16 is the northernmost exit.
  4. Plan: Exit at (39, 16). This leads to Route 3 (0, 6).
  5. Verified: East Wall of Pewter (Rows 0-15) is solid. No upper exit found.
  6. Conclusion: The exit at Row 16 is the ONLY exit to Route 3.
  7. Route 3 Strategy: The "Middle Lane" (Rows 6-7) MUST be the way forward.
  8. Previous blockage at (9, 7) or (13, 7) was likely an NPC or solvable obstacle.
  9. Plan: Enter Route 3 at (0, 6), push East past x=13. If blocked, identify the specific obstacle (NPC/Rock) and deal with it. Do not retreat to Lower Lane.
  3. Re-enter Route 3 from the Upper Lane (y=14).
  4. Traverse Route 3 along the top edge to Mt. Moon.
- **Next Action:** Walk Left to Pewter City.
