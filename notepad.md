# Suicune Quest Log (Crystal Version)
- Prerequisites: Clear Bell (Obtained).
- Quest Start: Turn 24182 (Timestamp: Saturday, Dec 27, 2025, 9:35 AM PST).
- Sighting Hunt Start: Turn 26522 (Timestamp: Saturday, Dec 27, 2025, 10:41 AM PST).
- Loop Start: Turn 26164 (Stuck on sightings).

## Current Strategy
- Plan:
  1. Trigger Route 42 sighting at (26, 15).
  2. Trigger Route 36 sighting at (35, 9).

  4. Battle Wise Trio to gain access to Tin Tower roof.

## Suicune Quest Diagnostic Log
- 1. Burned Tower: Flee event completed.
- 2. Cianwood City (North): Flee event observed (Suicune fled).
- 3. Eusine Battle (Cianwood): Marker at (11, 20) says defeated.
- 4. Route 42 sighting: Required trigger at (26, 15). Previous attempt at Turn 26434 failed, possibly due to sequence flags (Radio Tower must be cleared first).
- 5. Route 36 sighting: Required trigger at (35, 9).
- 6. Burned Tower Basement: Checked at Turn 26482 (Empty, confirm flee).
- 7. Ecruteak PC (Eusine): Checked Turn 26404.
- 8. Dance Theater (Eusine): Checked Turn 26415.
- 9. Wise Trio Battle: PENDING (Room 4_2 empty at Turn 26495).
- 10. Tin Tower Shook: Dialogue confirmed at Turn 26214.
- 11. Tin Tower Battle: LOCKED.

## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable. Verified.
- WALL: Impassable. Verified.
- WATER: Traversable ONLY with SURF. Verified at (13, 9).
- CUT_TREE: Remove with CUT. Verified at (24, 13).
- LADDER/STAIRS: Warp. Verified.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Ledge (North to South). Verified.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way (North to South). Cannot walk up.
- HEADBUTT_TREE: Impassable. Verified.
- TALL_GRASS: Walkable. Verified.
- WARP_CARPET: Warp. Verified.

## Lessons Learned
- Suicune events are strictly linear.
- Eusine's location depends on quest progress.
- Sages granting passage to Tin Tower indicates the "Clear Bell" event is active.
- Verification is key: Marker at (11, 20) confirms defeat, but sightings failure suggests missing flag or sequence issue.
## Strategy for Blackthorn City
- Route: Route 44 -> Ice Path -> Blackthorn City.
- Requirements: Waterfall (HM07) likely needed for navigation.
- Objective: Obtain the Rising Badge from Gym Leader Clair at next opportunity if Suicune hunt remains stalled.
- 12. Turn 26530: Encountered Wild Seaking at (18, 12). KIMCHI at 4 HP. Swapped lead to Calcifer.
