    - **Murkrow:** Muscle (Strength). Weak Defense.
    - **Houndoom:** Muscle (Cross Chop/Dig) or Gyarados (Surf).
2.  **Champion Lance:**
    - Ice moves needed (Gyarados has none, Muscle has none).
    - Rely on Muscle (Strength/Cross Chop) and Gyarados (Surf/Thrash).
    - Zenith (Dratini) has DragonBreath/Twister? No, Zenith is Lv15.
