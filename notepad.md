# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement (acting as a ledge). Passable from SOUTH to NORTH.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at Row 15 (X=3-17).
- ROCK: Smashable rocks act as WALLs.
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
## Strategy: The Great Land Bypass
Reach (14, 10) by navigating internal corridors via specific wall gaps.
1. Land at (23, 33) from (24, 33).
2. Move West to (10, 33) and South to (10, 35).
3. Move West through gap at (5, 35) to (4, 35).
4. Move North along X=4 to (4, 22).
5. Move West through gap at (3, 22) to (2, 22) (Western Corridor).
6. Walk North along X=2 to Row 12 (bypasses Row 15 ledge).
7. Walk East along Row 12 to (14, 12).
8. Walk North to (14, 10).

# Progress Notes
- Blocked: Row 34 ledge (X=6-8) blocks SOUTH movement from Row 33.
- Blocked: (4, 25) is a smashable rock (acts as WALL).
- Blocked: X=12 corridor blocked by WATER at Row 27.
- Verified: Row 35 gap at (5, 35) allows crossing X=5 wall.
- Verified: Row 22 gap at (3, 22) allows crossing X=3 wall.
- Verified: X=4 corridor is clear from Row 35 to Row 22 (detouring X=5 at Row 25).
- Verified: X=2 corridor is clear from Row 22 to Row 12.
- Verified: Row 12 is a clear horizontal path from X=2 to X=14.
