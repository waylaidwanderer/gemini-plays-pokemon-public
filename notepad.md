# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement. Passable from SOUTH to NORTH.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at Row 15 (X=3-17).
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
## Strategy: Sea Route Bypass (Verified)
Reach (14, 10) by surfing around the city via the eastern buoy gaps.
1. Move North along X=24 to (24, 10).
2. Move Right to (27, 10) (Gap in X=26 wall).
3. Move North to (27, 8) (Gap in Row 9 wall).
4. Move West along Row 8 to (19, 8) (Gap in X=22 wall).
5. Move West to (14, 8) and South to land on the plateau.
6. Walk to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

# Progress Notes
- Blocked: All land routes (X=2, 4, 6, 10, 12) are blocked by SOUTH-blocking ledges (FLOOR_UP_WALL).
- Verified: (26, 10) is a gap in the vertical buoy wall.
- Verified: (22, 8) is a gap in the vertical buoy wall.
- SUPER REPEL is active (Turn 49722).
- Stagnation Check: Abandoning land-based "secret gaps" as they are confirmed dead ends.
