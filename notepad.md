# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) in Cianwood City to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The West Beach Land Route (Verified)
- Plan:
  1. Use Super Repel. [DONE]
  2. Walk to (18, 51) via (18, 44). [IN PROGRESS]
  3. Walk West along Row 51 to (5, 51).
  4. Walk North to (5, 37) then West to West Beach (X=2).
  5. Walk North along West Beach (X=2) to (2, 12).
  6. Walk East along Row 12 to (14, 12), then North to (14, 10).
- Status: At (27, 44) on land. Repel active.
- Reasoning: The city is a vertical maze. X=18 is the only clear vertical path South to Row 51. Row 51 is the only land bridge to the West Beach (X=2). X=2 is a clear vertical highway to the northern plateau. Row 12 provides horizontal access to the sighting spot. Water routes are blocked by ledges at X=15.

# Blocked Routes (Verified)
- Central City: Vertical walls at X=5, X=9, X=11, X=17.
- Row 15 Barrier: Solid wall/ledge from X=3 to X=17.
- Row 30/34/46 Barriers: Impassable cliffs (FLOOR_UP_WALL).
- Route 41 Water Loop: Blocked by north-south ledge at X=15 (faces East).

# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard ground. Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Surf required. Traversable.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable cliff face.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
