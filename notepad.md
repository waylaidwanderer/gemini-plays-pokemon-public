# Reflection (Turn 15741)
- **Status:** Suicune hunt stalled. Suicune missing from Tin Tower 1F.
- **Current Hypothesis:** I need to reset the event by speaking to the Wise Trio at the Barrier Station Main Entrance, or use the Clear Bell at the correct time/place.
- **Action:** Traversing back from Tin Tower to Ecruteak City side of Barrier Station.
- **Lesson:** Legendaries in Gen 2 can have complex spawn triggers. White-outs might reset/despawn them until a map reload or specific NPC interaction.

# Suicune Mystery Log
- **Encounters:** Battled once, whited out.
- **Search 1 (Immediate Return):** Suicune absent at (9,9).
- **Search 2 (Map Reload):** Suicune absent.
- **Pokedex:** Not showing as roaming (only Poliwag/Gyarados in Water search).
- **Key Item:** Clear Bell ("Not the time to use that" at 10,2).

# Navigation
- **Current Map:** WiseTriosRoom (4_2).
- **Goal:** Exit via (7,4) to reach Barrier Station Main Hall (Left Side).
- **Navigation Anomaly:** Taking the Left Ladder `(1,4)` in Wise Trio Room `(4_2)` placed me at `(17,3)` in Barrier Station `(4_1)`, which is the **Right Side**.
- **Hypothesis:** I am on the "Tower" side of the Barrier Station. To reach the "City" side (Left Side), I must find a connector.
- **Action:** Investigating the Ladder at `(17,15)` on `4_1` (Right Side). It likely leads to the City side or a basement connector.
- **Navigation Update:** The ladder at `(17,15)` (Right Side) WARPED me to `(5,3)` (Left Side). I am now on the "City" side of the Barrier Station.
- **Action:** Talk to the Sage at `(4,6)` to see if he is part of the Wise Trio or has info on Suicune.
- **Goal:** Reset Suicune event.
- **Interaction:** Sage at (4,6) said "Please, do go on." (Permission granted).
- **Plan:** Talk to Wandering Sage and Wandering Gramps to gather info/confirm reset.
- **Action:** Moving to (6,8) to talk to Sage (ID 3) at (5,8).
- **Next:** Return to Tin Tower 1F and check (9,9) for Suicune again.
- **CRITICAL UPDATE:** Wandering Sage confirmed: "The TIN TOWER shook! A POKéMON must have returned to the top!"
- **Conclusion:** Suicune event has been RESET.
- **Action:** Returning to Tin Tower 1F to check (9,9) and look for new paths to the top.
- **Navigation:** Re-entering Barrier Station via Main Entrance (37,7).
- **Plan:** Walk straight through the Barrier Station to reach Bell Chime Trail. The Sages have granted permission ("Please, do go on"), so the path should be unblocked.
- **Objective:** Reach Tin Tower 1F to find Suicune.
- **Observation:** Suicune is NOT visible at (9,9) from position (9,11).
- **Hypothesis:** "Returned to the top" implies Suicune is on a higher floor or the Roof.
- **Plan:** Re-check the "Mystery Warp" at (10,2). The event reset might have activated it. If not, search for stairs in unexplored corners (Top-Right).
- **Action:** Retrying "Mystery Warp" at (10,2) now that the Wandering Sage confirmed the tower shook.
- **Reasoning:** The warp was inactive before, but the "shaking" event likely activated the path to the top. The XML map data explicitly flags (10,2) as a warp.
- **Status:** Standing on (10,2). Warp did not auto-trigger.
- **Action:** Pressing 'A' to inspect the floor.
- **Plan:** If inspection fails, I will step off and back on. If that fails, I will try using the Clear Bell again (just in case).
- **Action:** Checking Top-Right corner (16,2) for hidden stairs.
- **Hypothesis:** Since the warp is acting up and walls are solid, the path to "the top" might be a new staircase in the corner.
- **Next:** If empty, check the East Wall at (13,6) and talk to the Sage at (14,6) again.
- **Observation:** Wall at (12,1) confirms I must use Row 2 to traverse.
- **Hypothesis:** Speaking to the Sages INSIDE the tower might be required to activate the warp at (10,2) or reveal the path, now that the "shaking" event has occurred.
- **Plan:** Check (16,2), then talk to Sage at (14,6).
- **Observation:** Wall at (12,1) confirms I must use Row 2 to traverse.
- **Hypothesis:** Speaking to the Sages INSIDE the tower might be required to activate the warp at (10,2) or reveal the path, now that the "shaking" event has occurred.
- **Plan:** Check (16,2), then talk to Sage at (14,6).
- **Observation:** Sage at (14,6) still gives old lore text ("Two towers...").
- **Hypothesis:** The "Tower Shook" event might allow the **Clear Bell** to work at (10,2) now. I tried it *before* the event reset, but not after.
- **Plan:** Go to (10,2) and use the Clear Bell from the bag.
- **Contingency:** If that fails, talk to the Center Sage (11,11) and Left Sage (5,9).
- **Action:** Navigating to Key Items pocket to find and use Clear Bell.
- **Context:** Retrying Clear Bell at (10,2) after "Tower Shook" event.
- **Suicune Mystery Log Update:**
    - **Search 3 (Post-Shake):** Using Clear Bell at (10,2). Expectation: The event reset should allow the bell to function.
- **Result:** Clear Bell FAILED ("This isn't the time to use that!").
- **Status:** Suicune event is reset (Tower Shook), but Clear Bell is useless at (10,2).
- **Action:** Inspecting North Wall at (10,4) again.
- **Reasoning:** I checked this BEFORE talking to the Wandering Sage who confirmed the "shake". The shake likely removed a wall tile here to allow entry to the center room.
- **Plan:** Walk into (10,4). If open, find Suicune. If closed, check side walls.
- **Action:** Walking into the wall at (10,4).
- **Hypothesis:** The "shaking" removed this wall tile, opening the path to Suicune.
- **Observation:** Walking into wall at (10,4) failed. It is solid.
- **Action:** Pressing 'A' to inspect wall at (10,4).
- **Plan:** If inspection fails, I will resume the plan to check the Top-Right Corner (16,2) via Row 2, as I was interrupted before.
