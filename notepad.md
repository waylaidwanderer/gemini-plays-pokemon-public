# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard walkable ground. Verified traversable.
- WATER: Traversable only while Surfing.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable from the NORTH.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Impassable from the NORTH.
- HEADBUTT_TREE: Impassable.
- CUT_TREE: Impassable (becomes FLOOR when cut). Verified regrows on map exit.
- CAVE / WARP_CARPET: Warp to another map (e.g. Mt. Mortar, Gatehouse).
- COUNTER: Impassable. Used to interact with NPCs from an adjacent tile.

# Suicune Quest
- Status: 16 Badges, Red Defeated, Clear Bell in inventory.
- Timestamps:
    - Tin Tower Investigation Started: Turn #47028
    - Route 42 Re-investigation Started: Turn #47046
- Sighting Progress:
    1. Burned Tower (DONE)
    2. Cianwood City (DONE - Eusine defeated)
    3. Route 42 (Mahogany side) - PENDING (Expert says this is MANDATORY before Tin Tower).
    4. Kanto Route 14 (East of Fuchsia) - PENDING
    5. Kanto Route 25 (Cerulean Cape) - PENDING
- Strategy: Visit sighting spots in order. Route 42 is the current bottleneck. The Wise Trio in Ecruteak are non-interactable, likely until the Route 42 sighting is triggered.
- Expert Advice: Suicune must be found in the grove near the middle of Route 42 (requires Cut or Surf).
- Hypothesis: Sighting might require entering the grove from the Ecruteak side or standing on a specific tile.

# Verified Failures (Route 42)
- "Mow the lawn" in grove: FAILED (60+ turns, 100% tile coverage).
- "Sighting trigger at (28, 15)": FAILED.
- "Re-entry from Mahogany": FAILED.
- "Re-entry from Ecruteak": FAILED.
- "Re-entry from Mt. Mortar": FAILED.
- "Eusine in Ecruteak Center": FAILED (Turn 46981).
- Wise Trio Interaction (Ecruteak): FAILED (Turn 47043).

# Map Insights
- Route 42: Middle grove with Apricorns requires Cut at (24, 13).
- Mt. Mortar: B1F ladder at (19, 29) leads to 1FOutside (17, 29). B1F has an item ball at (21, 26).
- Ecruteak: Gatehouse to Route 42 is at (35, 27).
- Tin Tower: Located in Ecruteak City. Requires Clear Bell.

# Pivot Plan (If Route 42 Abandoned)
- Option A: Fly to Saffron -> Walk to Route 25 (Cerulean Cape).
- Option B: Visit Tin Tower in Ecruteak.
