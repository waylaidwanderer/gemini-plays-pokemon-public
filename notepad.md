# Suicune Strategy (Crystal Version)
- **Mechanics Check**: In Crystal, Suicune has fixed overworld sprite locations and is NOT a random grass encounter until the final stationary battle at Tin Tower.
- **Encounter Sequence**:
    1. Burned Tower: Trigger beasts to flee. (COMPLETED)
    2. Cianwood City: North end town. (COMPLETED)
    3. Route 42: Island in the middle (requires Surf and Cut). (IN PROGRESS - Started Turn 18704)
    4. Kanto Route 14: Near the water. (FUTURE)
    5. Tin Tower: Stationary battle with Clear Bell. (FUTURE)
- **Battle Plan**: Lead XENON (Gastly, Lv21) with Mean Look. Battle Strategy: Use Mean Look immediately, then Hypnosis. Weakened with low power moves or status.
- **Tin Tower Steps**: After all scripted flee events, enter Tin Tower in Ecruteak. Sages allow passage to the roof if you have the Clear Bell. Battle Strategy: Mean Look -> Hypnosis -> weaken.
