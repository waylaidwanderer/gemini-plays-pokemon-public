# Strategy: Trigger Suicune Sighting (Started: Turn 51131)
- City Logic: The city is divided by vertical walls. The Western Corridor (X=2) is the primary path to the northern sighting spot. Row 51 is a horizontal highway connecting all corridors. Gaps in the Row 46/48/50 terraces exist at X=12/13.
- Execution Plan:
  1. Walk North to (12, 44).
  2. Walk West to (8, 44) (through gaps at X=11 and X=9).
  3. Walk West to (6, 44) (through gap at X=7).
  4. Walk North to (6, 41) and West to (2, 41) (through gaps at X=5 and X=3).
  5. Walk North to (2, 10) and East to (14, 10).
- Battle Prep: Lead Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion).
