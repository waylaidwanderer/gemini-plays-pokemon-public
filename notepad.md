- **Route 25 Observations:**
    - **The Cape (Target):** Located at the far east (x=56), accessible only via water.
    - **Barriers:** The land area is walled off from the water channel.
    - **South Trap:** The area south of the maze (Rows 13-17, x=11-39) is a dead end, only reachable via the isolated pool at (42, 12).
    - **East Water Pool:** The pool at (42-53, 8-11) is isolated and does not connect to the main channel.
- **Route 24 Connectivity:**
    - **West Channel:** Isolated dead end. Walls block access to Cerulean City East or the Bridge.
    - **Hypothesis:** Must cross from West to East on Route 24 or Route 25 water.
- **Current Strategy:**
    1. Return North to Route 24.
    2. Attempt to Surf East under the bridge.
    3. If blocked, return to land on Route 25 (4, 15) and find a different exit from the "South Trap".
- **Goal:** Reach Cape (Route 25) via Route 24 East water channel.
