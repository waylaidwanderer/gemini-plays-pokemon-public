# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement. Passable from SOUTH to NORTH.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at Row 15 (X=3-17).
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
## Strategy: Sea Route Bypass (Final)
Reach (14, 10) by surfing around the city via the eastern buoy gaps.
1. Use SUPER REPEL and Surf East to X=27 corridor.
2. Surf North along X=27 to Row 8 (Gap in Row 9 buoy wall at 27, 9).
3. Surf West along Row 8 to X=14 (Above the trigger point).
4. Move South to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune sighting.

# Progress Notes
- Verified: X=27 is a clear vertical lane to the northern sea.
- Verified: (27, 9) is a gap in the buoy walls.
- Verified: Row 15 land/ledge blocks all internal land corridors.
- SUPER REPEL is active.
- Stagnation Check: Abandoning all land-based routes; Sea Route is the only path.
