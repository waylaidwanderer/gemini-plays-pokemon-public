# Gem's Pokémon Crystal Adventure!

## Current Mission
- **Primary Objective:** Defeat the Violet City Gym Leader.

## Gym Prep Plan
- Train Hearth and Periscope to at least Level 10 before challenging the Violet City Gym.
- Explore the area around Violet City (Sprout Tower) for training opportunities and items.

## Current Plan
### Route 29 to Cherrygrove City
1. Navigate the shifting maze of Route 29.
2. Proceed west towards the exit at (1, 6).
3. Enter Cherrygrove City.
4. Heal Pokémon at the Pokémon Center.

## Game Mechanics & Quirks
- **Headbutt Trees:** Some trees are 'HEADBUTT_TREE' type and are impassable.
- **Dialogue Triggers:** Some dialogues might loop until another specific NPC in the room is spoken to (e.g., Elm's Lab).
- **Wild Encounters:** Can be triggered on 'FLOOR' tiles if they are adjacent to 'TALL_GRASS' tiles. (Observed on Route 30).
- **One-Way Paths:** The gatehouse between Route 29 and Route 46 appears to be a one-way path.
- **Ledge Mechanics:** I can move sideways (left/right) along 'HOP_DOWN' tiles on Route 29.
- **Shifting Mazes:** Route 29's layout can change dynamically, blocking previously open paths. Must be navigated carefully, preferably with an agent.

## Agent Performance & Lessons
- **Trust Agents:** I must trust my agents' calculations over my own intuition, especially for navigation in shifting areas.
- **Systematic Updates:** When a new game mechanic is discovered, ALL relevant agents must be updated immediately.
- **World Knowledge Graph:** I need to check the graph before adding new edges to avoid errors.

## World Knowledge & NPCs
- **New Bark Town:** A Fisher at (12, 9) mentioned Prof. Elm discovered new Pokémon. A Scientist in Elm's Lab gave me Poké Balls after the Pokémon theft was reported.
- **Professor Elm:** Tasked me with challenging the Pokémon Gyms, starting with Violet City. Has a healing machine in his lab.
- **Rival Silver:** Stole a Pokémon from Professor Elm's lab.
- **Route 29:** A Cooltrainer at (52, 9) offers a Pokémon catching tutorial. A Youngster at (27, 16) gives advice, does not battle.

## Unverified Assumptions & Hypotheses
- **Mom's Healing:** Can Mom heal my Pokémon? (Test next time in New Bark Town)
- **Cherrygrove Mart:** Is the Poké Mart still inaccessible? (Check upon arrival)
- **Cooltrainer Battle:** Does the Cooltrainer on Route 29 battle you after the tutorial? (Talk to him again to verify)

## Completed Objectives & Past Events
- Started my journey and chose Hearth (Cyndaquil).
- Delivered the MYSTERY EGG to Professor Elm.
- Received a POKéDEX and POKé BALLS.
- Named my rival 'Silver'.
- Spoke to Mom and arranged for her to save my money.
- Caught a Sentret on Route 29 and named it Periscope.

## Reflection Notes (Turn 1925)
- My documentation needs to be kept up-to-date. I'll make sure to move completed tasks to the correct section of my notepad.
- I will continue to use map markers proactively for important NPCs and locations, placing them immediately after an event.
- I will be more diligent about checking my World Knowledge Graph before adding new data to avoid duplicates.
- I will start adding tags to my WKG nodes to make them more useful.
- My notepad should include more actionable, step-by-step plans for my goals.
