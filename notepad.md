# Global Mechanics
## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement. Allows NORTH movement. Found at Rows 34, 46, 48, 50.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at (10, 15).
- WALL: Impassable.
- ROCK: Smashable rock (acts as WALL).

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- Quest Start: Turn 48900
- Movement Attempt Start: Turn 49554

## Strategy: Outer Sea Surf Bypass
Reach the northern plateau (14, 10) by Surfing north in the Outer Sea (X=24) to bypass the Row 15 land ledge.

## Execution Plan
1. Surf into the Outer Sea at (24, 32). <- CURRENT TASK
2. Navigate North to Row 15 and pass through the buoy gap at (23, 15).
3. Navigate West along Row 11-14 to the landing point at (16, 12).
4. Walk to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune sighting.

## Lessons Learned
- Land paths (X=4, X=6, X=8, X=12) are all blocked by ledges or walls before reaching the plateau.
- Row 15 ledge blocks all central/eastern access to the plateau.
- Row 51 is the only confirmed "bottom" thoroughfare.
- Ledge Gaps: (12, 34) is a rare gap allowing South movement past Row 34.

## Progress Summary
- Turn 49556: At (23, 32). Surf text on screen. Clearing text to move to (24, 32).
