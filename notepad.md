## Tile Mechanics: Cianwood City
- FLOOR: Standard traversable ground.
- WALL: Impassable barrier.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way ledge. Blocks DOWN movement. Allows UP and East-West movement. (Verified at (6, 46)).

## Navigation: Landmarks
- Southern Rim (Row 52): Clear terrestrial path from East Shore (X=27) to West Beach (X=2).
- West Beach Highway (X=2): Clear North-South passage from Row 53 to Row 14.
- Plateau Path: Row 14 -> Row 12 -> (14, 10).

## Inventory Check
