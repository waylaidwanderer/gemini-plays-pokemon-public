## Strategy: Inner Channel Landing to Suicune
**Start Turn:** 48900 (Quest: Trigger Suicune Overworld Sighting)

Cianwood's internal walls and buoy lines form a maze. The Northern Plateau is only accessible by landing at the Inner Channel Landing (13, 16).

### Step-by-Step Execution Plan
1. Clear Surf message and apply Super Repel. - DONE
2. Surf North to (24, 16), then West to (21, 16) (X=22 Wall Gap).
3. Surf South to (21, 26), then West to (17, 26) (X=18 Wall Gap).
4. Surf North to (17, 16), then West to land at (13, 16).
5. Walk to the plateau: (13, 16) -> (11, 16) -> (11, 14) -> (8, 14) -> (8, 10) -> (14, 10).
6. Trigger Suicune sighting.

## Tile Mechanics: Cianwood City
- FLOOR: Standard ground.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Surf required.
- BUOY: Impassable water barrier.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way ledge. Blocks DOWN movement. Allows UP and East-West movement. (Verified at (6, 46)).

## Navigation: Buoy Gaps
- X=26 Wall: Gap at Row 10-15.
- X=22 Wall: Gap at Row 16-24.
- X=19/18 Wall: Gap at Row 26.

## Failed Hypotheses & Lessons
- Great Sea Bypass: Route 40 is a dead end on the West.
- Row 8/18/21 Gaps: Blocked by buoys or walls. Row 26 is the only confirmed way into the inner channel.
- Terrestrial Row 52: Blocked by WATER at (23, 32). Cannot walk south along the eastern shore.

## Inventory Check
- Super Repel: 4 remaining. Applied turn 49327.
- Party: Calcifer (Lv 64) leads. Ready for Eusine.
