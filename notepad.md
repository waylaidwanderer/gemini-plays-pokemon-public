# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
## Strategy: Great Southern Loop (Row 51)
Reach (14, 10) by bypassing all land ledges via the southern thoroughfare (Row 51). This is the most reliable land-based route.
1. Move South through ledge gaps:
   - Row 34 gap at (12, 34). (Done)
   - Row 46 gap at (18, 46). <- CURRENT TASK
   - Row 48 gap at (12, 48).
   - Row 50 gap at (10, 50).
2. Walk West along Row 51 to the Western Corridor (X=2).
3. Walk North along X=2 to Row 12 (bypasses Row 15 ledge).
4. Walk East to (14, 12) and North to (14, 10).
