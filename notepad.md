# Current Location
* Pewter Pokecenter (ID: 58) at (12,4)

# Current Goals
*   **Primary Goal:** Reach Cerulean City and prepare to challenge Gym Leader Misty.
*   **Secondary Goal:** Traverse Mt. Moon and reach Route 4 (East of Mt. Moon).
*   **Tertiary Goal:** Test rom_hack_mechanics_lookup_agent and team_composition_advisor_agent.

# Gameplay Notes & Strategy
## Navigation & Exploration
*   **CRITICAL:** Trust the **annotated screen** for immediate obstacles over map memory if there's a conflict.
*   The North map connection from Route 3 (e.g., (58,1)) leads to the *lowest tier* of 'Route 4 (Before Mt. Moon)' at (8,18), not into Mt. Moon 1F (Western side). This route is a loop if trying to access upper Route 4 tiers or the western Mt. Moon entrance for traversal.
*   When on Route 4 (Before Mt. Moon) upper tiers, navigate eastward by descending ledges.
*   The Super Nerd at Mt. Moon B2F (30,12) requests a fossil; he does not provide one.

## Battle Strategy
*   Improve precision in battle menu navigation.
*   Be mindful of type matchups and PP conservation.
*   **Risk Assessment:** Avoid switching in Pokémon with critically low HP against opponents that can KO them.

## ROM Hack Specifics
*   **General Changes:** Old Rod (Viridian Mart), HMs forgettable/menu use, TMs repurchasable, Trade evos by level.
*   **Type Matchup Changes:** Ghost (Special) SE vs Psychic. Bug no longer SE vs Poison.
*   **Stat Boosts:** Pikachu, Farfetch’d, Venomoth, Onix.
*   **Level Caps:** Misty (Starmie Lv21 -> Cap 21), Lt. Surge (Raichu Lv28 -> Player Cap 24).

# Agent Development Plan
*   **`item_finder_reminder_agent` (USE AS NEEDED):**
    *   **Status:** Defined. Works well.
*   **`rom_hack_mechanics_lookup_agent` (Low Priority - Test):**
    *   **Status:** Defined. Untested.
*   **`team_composition_advisor_agent` (Low Priority - Test):**
    *   **Status:** Defined. Untested.
*   **`hm_advisor_agent` (Low Priority - Test):**
    *   **Status:** Defined. Untested.
*   **Agent Usage Review (`battle_strategy_agent`, `encounter_optimizer_agent`, `level_up_move_advisor_agent`, `next_battle_action_advisor_agent`, `tm_learning_advisor_agent`):**
    *   **Status:** Defined.
    *   **Action:** Evaluate necessity of less-used agents. Consolidate or delete if not providing consistent value. Reduce reliance on `next_battle_action_advisor_agent`.
*   **`dungeon_navigator_agent` (USE WITH CAUTION):**
    *   **Status:** Defined. High usage noted. Attempt more manual navigation. Review paths or use 'avoid_coordinates' when using.

# ARCHIVED LOGS (Summarized)
*   **Mt. Moon Exploration:** Successfully navigated Mt. Moon and found eastern exit to Route 4. Noted complexity and segmented nature of B1F/B2F. Super Nerd wants a fossil.
*   **Route 4 (Before Mt. Moon) Navigation:** Initial attempts to navigate Route 4 eastward from Mt. Moon's exit were inefficient due to prematurely jumping down ledges, forcing a loop back via Route 3. The correct path requires staying on the upper tier after exiting Mt. Moon (eastern exit) and heading east. Current plan involves backtracking through Route 3, re-entering Mt. Moon from the west, traversing it to its eastern exit, then exploring eastward on the upper tier of Route 4.
