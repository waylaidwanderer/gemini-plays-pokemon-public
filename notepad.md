## Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Traversable.

## Active Quest: Find Granddaughter
- Status: Investigating lower deck (B1F).
- Clue: Gentleman (2, 17) on 1F said she's energetic and bugging someone.
- Clue: Sailor (ID 2) at (31, 6) on B1F was looking for his "lazy bum" buddy.
- Progress: Found the buddy (ID 1) at (30, 6). Both sailors seem to have updated positions/dialogue after map reset.
- Strategy: Finish dialogue with Sailor at (31, 6). Explore western corridors of B1F.

## Kanto Strategy

- Target 1: Lt. Surge (Vermilion City).
- MVP: GNEISS (Graveler) Lv 51. Ground-type immunity to Electric.

- NPCs may block corridors until specific events/dialogue.
- NPCs often update positions after a map transition.
