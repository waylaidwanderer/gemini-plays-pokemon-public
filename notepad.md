## Tile Mechanics (2F)
- Vertical Barriers: Column 4 (Row 0-12), Column 2 (Row 10-17), Column 9 (Row 12-17).

- Column 8: Blocked by walls at (8, 8-9)? Verification in progress.

## Puzzle Plan
- Goal: Verify the path for B8 (8, 14) to reach P3 (8, 7).
- Step 1: Push B8 Up to (8, 10) systematically.
- Step 2: Test collision at (8, 9).
- Step 3: If (8, 9) is a wall, test (7, 10) and (7, 11) from column 6.
- Hypothesis: B8 must either go through (8, 9) or pivot through column 7 to reach its pit.
