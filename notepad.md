# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement (acting as a ledge). Passable from SOUTH to NORTH.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at Row 15 (X=3-17).
- ROCK: Smashable rocks act as WALLs.
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
## Strategy: Verified Land Route (The S-Curve)
Reach (14, 10) by navigating internal corridors to bypass all obstacles.
1. Surf South to (23, 33) and land.
2. Move West along Row 33 to (9, 33).
3. Move West through gap at (9, 33) to (6, 33).
4. Move North along X=6 to (6, 24).
5. Move West through gap at (5, 24) to (4, 24).
6. Move North along X=4 to (4, 22).
7. Move West through gap at (3, 22) to (2, 22) (Western Corridor).
8. Walk North along X=2 to (2, 12).
9. Walk East along Row 12 to (14, 12).
10. Walk North to (14, 10).

# Progress Notes
- Blocked: Sea Route is a complex buoy maze; Land route is more predictable.
- Verified: Row 33 gap at (9, 33) crosses X=9 wall.
- Verified: Row 24 gap at (5, 24) crosses X=5 wall.
- Verified: Row 22 gap at (3, 22) crosses X=3 wall.
- Verified: X=2 corridor (Row 22 to Row 12) bypasses the Row 15 ledge (X=3-17).
- Verified: Row 12 is a clear horizontal path from X=2 to X=14.
