# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- PIT: Warp tile. Falling through takes you to the floor below.
- LADDER: Warp tile. Used to travel between floors.
- BOULDER: Object. Impassable. Can be pushed with Strength.
- ICE: Sliding mechanic (Ice Path).
- ROCK: Destructible with ROCK SMASH.
- WATER: Requires Surf to traverse.
- WARP: Static transition between maps/locations.
- BOULDER BRIDGES: Boulders in pits (1F 2,6; 7,6; 7,7) act as passable FLOOR.

# Blackthorn City & Gym Discoveries
- Pokemon Center: (21, 29).
- Emy's House: (29, 23). Trade DODRIO for female DRAGONAIR.
- Move Deleter's House: (9, 31).
- Dragon Speech House: (13, 21).
- Blackthorn Gym Entrance: (18, 11).
- Trainers Defeated: Paul (1, 14), Mike (6, 6), Lola (9, 2) on 1F; Fran (4, 11), Cody (4, 1) on 2F.
- Gym Guide (7, 15) advice: Dragon-type Pokemon are weak against Ice-type moves.
- Gym Layout: Island (Rows 2-10) is isolated from Mainland (Rows 12-17). Use 2F detours to cross.

# Strategy: Gym Leader Clair (Start Turn: 29455)
- Status: 1 Dragonair defeated. Kingdra (Lv40) is out. Calcifer, KIMCHI, ICARUS, XENON & Ravioli fainted. GNEISS (126/126 HP) is my last hope. No Revives or major healing items left. Kingdra accuracy -1.
- Plan:
  1. GNEISS is on the field. Select FIGHT.
  2. Use Earthquake (Neutral damage).
  3. Hope for accuracy misses or Kingdra using non-lethal moves.

# Blackthorn Gym Layout Theory
- Pit Destinations:
  - 2F Pit (2, 5) -> 1F (2, 6)
  - 2F Pit (8, 7) -> 1F (7, 7)
  - 2F Pit (8, 3) -> 1F (7, 6)

# Reflection & Lessons
- **NPC Collision:** Defeated NPCs are impassable. (Turn 29424)
- **Warp Safety:** 1F Entry Points (5, 6, 7) correspond to specific 2F pits. (Turn 29374)
- **Isolation:** Isolated map areas require indirect paths (e.g., through 2F). (Turn 29420)
- **Item Management:** Running out of Max Potions and having no Revives makes Kingdra extremely dangerous. Smokescreen was a good attempt but failed due to Surf's high damage and Typhlosion's paralysis.

# Type Effectiveness (Verified)
- Dragon resists: Fire, Water, Electric, Grass. (Verified vs Dragonair, Turn 29459)
- Kingdra (Water/Dragon) resists: Fire (1/4x), Water (1/4x), Electric (1/2x), Grass (1/2x).
- Normal & Ground: Neutral vs Dragon.
