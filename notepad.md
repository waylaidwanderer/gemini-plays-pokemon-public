# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Strategy: Finding Rock Smash
The northern plateau (14, 10) is blocked by boulders. I need TM08 Rock Smash to proceed. 

### Action Plan
1. Talk to NPCs outside near the northern rock clusters (Row 16-27). This is the most likely source of TM08.
2. If not found, check remaining buildings: Pharmacy (15, 47) and Lugia Speech House (15, 37).
3. Teach Rock Smash to GNEISS (Graveler) or GORP (Snorlax).
4. Clear boulders at (8, 16) or (10, 27) and reach Suicune.

## Verified Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way ledge/impassable from the North.
- ROCK: Impassable without Rock Smash.
- Vertical Walls: Major barriers at X=5/6 and X=16-20.

## Battle Plan: Eusine
- Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion) sweep.
- Drowzee/Haunter: Flamethrower.
- Electrode: Thunderpunch or Return.

## Phone Contacts
- Tully, Alan, Arnie, Chad, Dana.
