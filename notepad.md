# Lessons Learned
- **Menu Hygiene:** Visual confirmation is required before entering complex sequences.
- **Economics:** Super Repels > Max Repels.
- **Fly Mechanics:** 'Select' button toggles map regions in Gen 2. Indigo Plateau is the connection point.
- Fly Map Debugging Concluded:
  - West Kanto (Pewter/Viridian/Pallet/Cinnabar) seems isolated from East Kanto on the Fly Map for unknown reasons (input drops or logic).
  - Decision: Abandon direct Fly to Saffron.
  - Action: Fly to **Pewter City** (Current Cursor).
  - New Route: Walk from Pewter -> Route 3 -> Mt. Moon -> Cerulean -> Saffron.
  - Rationale: Walking is reliable. Debugging the map is not.
  - Goal: Reach Saffron City via foot/Magnet Train.
