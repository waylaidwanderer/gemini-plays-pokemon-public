# Ilex Forest Quest: Runaway Farfetch'd
*Started Turn 2803*

## Goal: Catch the bird to obtain HM01 (Cut).

## Puzzle Mechanics
- **Apprentice Hint**: "You have to get behind it to catch it."
- **Startle Logic**: Interacting from the front or side makes the bird fly ~6 tiles along the path.
- **Twig Logic**: Tiles with specs (Verified Row 31, X=23-29) are noisy. Stepping on them makes the bird turn to face the player.
- **Success Condition**: Interact from the tile directly behind the bird's facing direction WITHOUT alerting it (avoid twigs or drive it to clean ground).

## Strategy: Current Capture Plan
1. **Locate**: Bird is at (28, 31) facing UP.
2. **Identify Noisy Path**: Row 31 contains twigs.
3. **Approach**: Circle around to (28, 32) via clean ground (Northern loop through X=14 -> Row 35).
4. **Interact**: Press UP while at (28, 32) to catch it from behind.

## Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR**: Clean ground. Passable.
- **TWIGS**: Noisy ground. Alerts bird. (Row 31).
- **WALL / DENSE_TREES**: Impassable.
- **HEADBUTT_TREE**: Impassable.
- **CUT_TREE**: Impassable. Requires HM01 Cut.
- **LEDGE_HOP**: One-way traversal.

## Locations & Progress
- **Charcoal Kiln**: Azalea (21, 13). Reward for this quest is Cut.
- **Badges**: Zephyr, Hive.
