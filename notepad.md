# Active Strategy: The Suicune Pursuit
- **Goal:** Trigger Suicune sighting at (14, 10) in northern Cianwood.
- **Battle Prep:** Lead with Lv64 Calcifer to sweep Eusine's team.
- **Plan (The X=2 Expressway):**
  1. Currently at (27, 45). Move Right to (28, 45) and Surf.
  2. Surf South to Row 51 (via X=30 to bypass buoy wall at X=29).
  3. Land at (24, 51) and walk West on Row 51 to (2, 51).
  4. Walk North via X=2 corridor to (2, 12) (Clear of all barriers).
  5. Walk East on Row 12 to (14, 12), then North to (14, 10).
- **Verification:** Row 12 is a confirmed clear horizontal corridor from X=5 to X=16. X=2 corridor is clear from Row 51 to Row 12.
