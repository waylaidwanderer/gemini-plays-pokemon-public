# Ilex Forest Quest: Runaway Farfetch'd
*Started Turn 2803*

## Goal: Catch the bird to obtain HM01 (Cut).

## Puzzle Mechanics
- **Success Condition**: Interact from the tile directly behind the bird's facing direction.
- **Startle Logic**: Interacting from the front or side makes the bird fly ~6 tiles away.
- **Twig Logic**: Tiles with dark specs are noisy. Stepping on them makes the bird turn to face the player.
- **Noisy Tiles (Specs)**: 
  - Row 26: (14, 26), (15, 26)
  - Row 28: (14, 28) to (18, 28)
  - Row 31: (23, 31) to (29, 31)
- **Verified Clean Tiles**: Row 23, Row 24.

## Strategy: Current Capture
- **Status**: Bird at (20, 24) facing LEFT. Player at (21, 24) on clean ground.
- **Plan**: Turn LEFT to face bird, then interact from behind to catch.
- **Verification**: Row 24 is clean (no twigs). This prevents the bird from turning to face the player.

## Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR**: Passable. Clean ground.
- **TWIGS**: Noisy ground (specs). Alerts bird.
- **WALL / DENSE_TREES**: Impassable.
- **HEADBUTT_TREE**: Impassable.
- **CUT_TREE**: Impassable. Requires HM01 Cut.

## Locations & Progress
- **Charcoal Kiln**: Azalea (21, 13). Reward: Cut.
- **Badges**: Zephyr, Hive.
