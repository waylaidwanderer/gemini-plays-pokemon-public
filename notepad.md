# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
- **Start Turn:** 49885
- **Current Status:** Heading to the western "Highway" (X=2) via the Row 18 cross-over.

## Active Strategy: The Western Highway (X=2)
The northern plateau (14, 10) is accessible via the western coastal highway (X=2). This route avoids all ledges and rocks by using a specific cross-over at Row 18.

### Execution Plan
1. Central Corridor: Walk to (6, 33). (In Progress)
2. Terrace Ascent: Walk North along X=6 to (6, 18).
3. Western Cross-over: Walk West to (4, 18), then South to (4, 20).
4. Highway Entry: Walk Left to (2, 20) to reach the Western Highway.
5. Coastal Dash: Walk North along X=2 to Row 10.
6. Final Approach: Walk East to (14, 10).

## Verified Mechanics
- X=6 Corridor: Clear north-south path from Row 33 to Row 18.
- Row 18/19: Clear horizontal path from X=6 to X=4.
- (4, 20): FLOOR_UP_WALL. Allows movement from (4, 21) or (4, 19) into the tile, and from (4, 20) to (2, 20).
- X=2 Highway: Clear north-south path from Row 20 to Row 10.

## Battle Plan: Eusine
- Expected Team: Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25).
- Lead: Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion).
- Strategy: Flamethrower sweep.

## Failed Hypotheses
- Hypothesis 1: Land access via X=11 (blocked by Row 31 wall).
- Hypothesis 2: Direct Surf to beach (dead end).
- Hypothesis 3: Cut tree at (11, 13) (fake tree).
- Hypothesis 4: Ocean Loop (unnecessary detour).
