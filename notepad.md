# Current Goals (Revised Turn 8421)
*   **Primary Goal:** Reach Cerulean City and train key team members (especially ZAPPY and BELLA) to Lv20-21 to challenge Gym Leader Misty (Ace Starmie Lv21, Player Cap 21).
*   **Secondary Goal:** Exit Mt. Moon and reach Route 4.
*   **Tertiary Goal:** Explore remaining reachable unseen tile at (9,7) on Mt. Moon B2F OR find a Pokémon Center to heal Nina and Zappy.

# Gameplay Notes & Strategy
## Navigation & Exploration
*   **CRITICAL:** Trust the **annotated screen** for immediate obstacles over map memory if there's a conflict.
*   The North map connection from Route 3 leads to the *lowest tier* of 'Route 4 (Before Mt. Moon)', forming a loop for upper Route 4/western Mt. Moon access.
*   When on Route 4 (Before Mt. Moon) upper tiers, navigate eastward by descending ledges.
*   **Path Validation (CRITICAL):** Rigorously verify paths generated by `dungeon_navigator_agent`, especially in complex, warp-heavy environments like Mt. Moon, by cross-referencing with map data or using manual checks for initial segments. Reduce reliance.
*   **Multi-Tile Warps:** Be consistently aware of 2-step activation (onto tile, then into boundary/direction).
*   **Mt. Moon Fossil Hunt Plan (REVISED - Turn 8421 - FOSSIL OBTAINED):
    1.  **Objective:** Obtain a Fossil (Dome or Helix). - COMPLETE (Helix Fossil obtained).
    2.  **Source:** Super Nerd (ID 1, sprite MTMOONB2F_SUPER_NERD) at (Mt. Moon B2F, 13,9) guarded the fossils. He was defeated in battle.
    3.  **Fossil Acquisition:** After defeating Super Nerd (ID 1), the Helix Fossil was picked up at (14,7).
    4.  **Next Step:** Find the eastern Mt. Moon exit to Route 4. The Super Nerd (ID 4) at (30,12) might still be relevant if he blocks the path or has new dialogue after a fossil is obtained, but he is currently unreachable.
*   **Item Acquisition:** Key items like fossils, if pick-ups, will be visible item sprites on the map and listed in the `Map Sprites` section *after the trigger event*. Do not interact with empty ground tiles expecting items.

## Battle Strategy
*   Improve precision in battle menu navigation.
*   Be mindful of type matchups and PP conservation. Internalize ROM hack type changes.
*   **Risk Assessment:** Avoid switching in Pokémon with critically low HP against opponents that can KO them.
*   **Healing Priority:** Prioritize reaching a Pokémon Center quickly if key Pokémon are critically injured.

## ROM Hack Specifics
*   **General Changes:** Old Rod (Viridian Mart), HMs forgettable/menu use, TMs repurchasable, Trade evos by level.
*   **Type Matchup Changes (CRITICAL TO MEMORIZE):** Ghost (Special) SE vs Psychic. Bug no longer SE vs Poison. Grass is 0.25x vs Poison/Flying (e.g., Zubat). Poison attacks NVE vs Zubat (Poison/Flying). Bug SE vs Poison (likely 2x, resulting in 4x vs Grass/Poison like Gloom).
*   **Stat Boosts:** Pikachu, Farfetch’d, Venomoth, Onix.
*   **Level Caps:** Misty (Starmie Lv21 -> Cap 21), Lt. Surge (Raichu Lv28 -> Player Cap 24).

## PC Interaction Notes
*   Pewter City PC is on the far right (east side) of the Pokecenter.
*   'SOMEONE's PC' for Pokémon Storage. 'Gem's PC' for Item Storage.

# Agent Development & Usage (Revised Turn 8054)
*   **Current Agents (10/10):** `level_up_move_advisor_agent`, `next_battle_action_advisor_agent`, `exploration_prioritizer_agent`, `tm_learning_advisor_agent`, `rom_hack_mechanics_lookup_agent`, `dungeon_navigator_agent`, `team_composition_advisor_agent`, `item_use_advisor_agent`, `trainer_data_logger_agent`, `gym_leader_strategist_agent`.
*   **High Usage Agents to Monitor & Reduce Reliance:**
    *   `dungeon_navigator_agent` (91 uses): REDUCE RELIANCE. Prioritize manual navigation or segment/verify agent paths. Actively work on manual pathfinding.
    *   `next_battle_action_advisor_agent` (23 uses): Continue efforts for more manual battle decisions, especially for common wild Pokémon.
*   **Agent Slot Management:** 10/10 agents defined. All slots are currently full.

*   Exited Mt. Moon (western exit) onto Route 4 (Before Mt. Moon).
*   Confirmed Route 3 (North) to Route 4 (Before Mt. Moon) (South) map connection forms a loop.
*   Deposited WIGGLES (Caterpie Lv4) into PC Box 3. Withdrew SIR (Paras Lv13) from PC Box 1.
*   Healed party at Mt. Moon Pokecenter (most recently turn 7866).
*   Obtained Helix Fossil from Mt. Moon B2F after defeating Super Nerd (ID 1).

# Navigation Rules & Insights
*   NPCs on `navigable: false` tiles are impassable physical obstacles, even if defeated or non-battling.
*   Ledge tiles marked `navigable="true"` can be occupied (e.g., by jumping down onto them), but upward movement onto a ledge from below is prevented by game physics, even if the tile's `navigable` attribute is true. The game's movement denial takes precedence over the XML's `navigable` flag for directional traversal of ledges from below.
*   Defeated trainers may sometimes remain as physical obstacles on their tile; their tile will remain `navigable: false` in map memory.

# Dungeon Navigation Insights (NEW)
*   **Segmented Dungeons (CRITICAL):** Complex dungeons like Mt. Moon often have multiple disconnected segments on the *same floor*. Different warps/ladders are keys to these distinct areas. Systematically explore each warp from a given floor to discover all accessible sub-sections of other floors. Do not assume all parts of a lower floor are accessible from a single entry point.

# Agent Usage & Development (Further Notes - Turn 8112)
*   Prioritize manual navigation for simple paths; `dungeon_navigator_agent` (91 uses) often needs manual correction for Pikachu. Reduce reliance.
*   Consider deleting underused agents (e.g., `exploration_prioritizer_agent`, `rom_hack_mechanics_lookup_agent`) if slots are needed. `exploration_prioritizer_agent` has been useful for identifying targets, will keep for now.

## NPC Interaction Rules & Key Dialogue (NEW - Turn 8113)
*   Some NPC dialogue that seems like a request or statement (e.g., Super Nerd's "If you find a fossil, give it to me and scram!") might actually be a pre-battle taunt if the NPC is an undefeated trainer blocking a path or objective. Always consider context and whether the NPC is a known trainer type.

# Agent Development & Usage (Further Notes - Turn 8162)
*   `exploration_prioritizer_agent` Limitations: The agent might fail to provide suggestions if 'Reachable Unseen Tiles' (from game state) are not marked `navigable="true"` in the map XML. Its Python script currently looks for `seen="false"` AND `navigable="true"`. Consider updating its prompt to instruct its code to also analyze tiles adjacent to `navigable="true"` tiles that are `seen="false"`, or to directly use the 'Reachable Unseen Tiles' list from game state if that's more reliable, especially in complex, segmented dungeons where XML `navigable` status might be misleading for overall reachability.

*   `dungeon_navigator_agent` (91 uses): Drastically reduce reliance, especially for complex, multi-segment navigation or when targets are known to be in separate areas. Prioritize manual pathfinding or breaking navigation into smaller, verifiable segments. Be more critical of its output.
*   **1x1 Warp Activation:** Be more consistent with 1x1 warp activation, especially considering Pikachu's position. Stepping off and then back on is the reliable method if unsure.

# Gameplay Reminders (Post-Reflection Turn 8367)
*   **Reachable Unseen Tiles List:** Always use the *current* list from the Game State Information for exploration planning. This list is dynamic and can change frequently.
*   **Navigation Goal Coordinates:** Ensure `navigation_goal_coordinates` are always confirmed `navigable: true` in the map XML or are part of the current 'Reachable Unseen Tiles' list from Game State to avoid pathing errors.

# Future Agent Ideas (Brainstorming)
*   **Boulder Puzzle Helper Agent:** Could analyze `map_xml_string` to identify boulder positions, switches, and barriers, then suggest optimal push sequences for Strength puzzles. Input: target switch/barrier. Output: sequence of boulder pushes.
*   **Objective Validator Agent:** Given a player-defined objective (e.g., 'Reach Super Nerd at X,Y'), it would check `map_xml_string` and game state to confirm if the target is currently `reachable: yes` or if its tile is `navigable: true`. Could help prevent pathing to currently impossible targets. Input: target description/coordinates. Output: validation (true/false), reason if false.

# Navigation Rules & Insights (NEW - Turn 8471)
*   **Mt. Moon B2F Discrepancies:** Significant differences noted between map XML `navigable` status and actual on-screen impassable tiles, particularly in the southern and eastern-central segments. Rely more on annotated screen views for immediate pathing decisions, especially when map memory suggests a path that is visually blocked.
