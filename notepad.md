# Lessons Learned
- **Automation vs. Interruptions:** Phone calls and unexpected events freeze the game, causing fixed-input sequences (like hunt routines) to desync. Always monitor for these and manually reset if necessary.
- **Efficiency:** "Checking with your face" (running into grass) is faster than checking the Pokedex to locate Roaming Beasts.

# Current Status
- **Location:** Route 37 (8, 0). Checking Grass.
- **Activity:** Hunting Raikou & Entei.
- **Party:** Gyarados (Lv 36) Lead for Repel Trick. Lugia in party.
- **Active Effect:** None (Repel wore off). Applying last Max Repel.

# Legendary Beast Hunt Strategy
- **Target:** Raikou (#238) & Entei (#239).
- **Method:** Blind Hunt Loop (Route 37 Grass <-> Ecruteak City).
- **Tactics:**
  1. Enter Route 37 from Ecruteak.
  2. Run into grass (Down x2, Left/Right wiggle).
  3. If no encounter, run back to Ecruteak (Up).
  4. Repeat.
- **Lesson:** Phone calls freeze movement, causing the fixed-input hunt tool to 'miss' the grass check phase. If interrupted, manually move to Ecruteak to reset.
