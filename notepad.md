# Current Strategy: Enter Warp (11, 5) to Southern Item Rooms
- **Start Turn:** 26744 (Jan 7, 2026)
- **Location:** Silver Cave Room 2 (3_75)
- **Status:** In Battle at (11, 6). Just one tile away from the Warp!
- **Goal:** Run from battle, then Step North into Warp (11, 5).
- **Reflection (Turn 26744):**
  - **Execution:** No deferred tasks.
  - **Correction:** The `navigate` tool successfully moved me from (6, 13) all the way to (11, 6) before the battle. The "Position Mismatch" warning was just me not realizing how far I got!
  - **Lesson:** When `navigate` is interrupted, check Game State position immediately. Do not assume I am at the start of the path.
  - **Navigation:** The "East Path" (Landing at 14, 30 -> Gap at 19, 27 -> North Corridor) is the CORRECT path to the Southern Item Rooms.

# Key Findings
- **Silver Cave Room 2:**
