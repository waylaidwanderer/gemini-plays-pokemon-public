# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Cross the whirlpool to reach the Dragon Shrine.

# Key Mechanics & Lessons
- **Field Moves:** If 'A' interaction fails (even when facing correctly), ALWAYS fallback to Menu -> Pokemon -> [Mon] -> [Move].
- **Whirlpool:** Requires facing the whirlpool tile directly. 'A' button might be unreliable; Menu is safer.

- Status: Correction - Exiting Menu to Face Down.
- Reason: 'Whirlpool' from menu failed ("Can't use that here") because I am facing UP. Whirlpool is BELOW me.
- Step 1: Exit Party Menu (B).
- Step 2: Exit Main Menu (B).
- Step 3: Face Down.
- Step 4: Interact (A) or use Menu again.
