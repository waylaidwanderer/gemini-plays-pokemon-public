# Game Mechanics & Discoveries
## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR (Brown): Walkable, non-sliding.
- ICE (B1F Rows 1-2): Sliding mechanic.
- PIT: Warp to B2F. Filling a pit creates a stopper on B2F.
- BOULDER: Boulders in pits do NOT reset. Boulders on floor reset on ladder use. Verified.
- STRENGTH: Must be re-activated after battle or floor change. Verified.

## Encounters
- Golbat (Lv25) at (5, 9).
- Delibird at (7, 9).
- Zubat at (12, 11).

# Tracking & Verification
- B2F Stoppers: P3 and P4 (Verified by absence of B3/B4 at start).
- Pits: P3 and P4 filled. P1 and P2 unfilled.
- Verification Needed: Confirm B2F stoppers after each pit fall.

# Failed Hypotheses
- "B1F floor tiles do NOT slide" was too broad; Row 1-2 ice tiles DO slide.
- Mixed inputs in menus cause errors; use single actions or autopress.
- "Boulders do not reset on pit fall" - Boulders in pits are permanent stoppers. Verified.
