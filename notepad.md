# Ice Path Strategy
- **Current State:** At Ice Path B1F (7, 9).
- **Goal:** Clear the Boulder blockade at (x=7-9, y=8-10) to access the South Room.
- **Status:** STRENGTH Active. Text box open.
- **Status:** Back on B1F (17, 3). Boulders Reset.
- **Immediate Goal:** Navigate to West Side (Col 5) to access South area.
- **Route:** `(17, 3) -> (17, 2) -> (16, 2) -> Row 1 -> (6, 1) -> (6, 2) -> (5, 2)`.
- **Master Plan (Boulders Reset):**
  1. **Access South:** From (5, 2), go Down Col 5 to Row 16.
  2. **Solve B1 (Pit 11, 2):** Go East to (11, 16) -> North to (11, 8). Push B1 Up to (11, 5) -> Right to (13, 5) -> Up to (13, 1) -> Left to (11, 1) -> Down to Pit (11, 2).
  3. **Solve B4 (Pit 12, 13):** Go East to (18, 16) -> North to (18, 7). Push B4 Left to (16, 7). Maneuver to Push B4 Down to (16, 12) -> Left to (12, 12) -> Down to Pit (12, 13).
  4. **Solve B2 (Pit 4, 7):** Standard (Left -> Up -> Left -> Down).
  5. **Solve B3 (Pit 5, 12):** Standard.
- **Next Step:** Navigate to (5, 2).
