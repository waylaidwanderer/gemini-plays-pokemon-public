# Strategy for Primary Goal (Defeat Gym Leader Jasmine)
- Observation: Jasmine uses Steel-type Pokémon (2x Magnemite Lv30, Steelix Lv35).
- Weaknesses: Fire, Fighting, Ground.
- Team Assets: Calcifer (Fire), GNEISS (Ground), Blarney (Fighting move: Low Kick).
- Plan: Use Calcifer's FLAME WHEEL as the primary weapon. Special Fire moves bypass Steel-type physical bulk.

# Strategy for KIMCHI Training
- Training Route: Surf Route 40/41.
- Method: Use shared XP by leading with KIMCHI and switching to Calcifer or GNEISS.
- Goal: Reach Lv21+ for evolution into Gloom.

# Game Mechanics & Systems
## Tile Mechanics
- Verified Traversal:
  - FLOOR: Traversable in all directions.
  - WALL / BUOY / ROCK / BOOKSHELF / TV / RADIO / TOWN_MAP / STATUE / COUNTER: Impassable barriers.
  - WATER: Traversable while surfing (HM03 Surf + Fog Badge). Verified.
  - LADDER / DOOR / PIT / WARP_CARPET: Triggers map transition upon entry.
  - PIT: Drops player to the floor below (usually landing on a specific tile).
- Verified RELATIONAL Behavior:
  - Counter NPCs: Must interact with the COUNTER tile in front of them.
  - PCs/Switches: Must face UP from directly BELOW the tile.

## Lessons Learned
- Strength (HM04): Obtained from the Sailor in Olivine Cafe (1, 7).
- Boulder Dialogue: "A POKéMON may be able to move this" indicates Strength is needed.
- Gym Access: Cianwood Gym requires Strength to reach the Leader.
- Battle Mechanics: FIRE moves are Special in Gen 2. HEADBUTT is a Physical Normal-type move. Steelix has high Physical Defense but lower Special Defense; use Special attacks (Fire).
- NPC Interaction: Always face the counter tile, not the NPC sprite, when talking to Clerks or Nurses.
- XP Sharing: Switching a Pokémon out allows it to gain 50% of the battle experience.
- Rival (Malice) Anomaly: Sprite confirmed standing on water at (14, 15) on Route 40 (Turn 6868). Currently absent.
- Lighthouse Descent: The structure is a series of concentric rings. Navigating between the inner pillar and outer ring requires dropping through specific pits on higher floors. Path: 6F (16, 5) -> 5F (16, 7) -> 4F (16, 9) -> 3F outer ring -> 2F ladder -> 1F exit.
