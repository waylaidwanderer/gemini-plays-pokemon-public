# I. Game Mechanics & Traversal
## A. Core Rules
- **Level Cap:** 8 badges = Level 65.
- **"No Will to Fight" Message:** A party menu cursor error on a fainted Pokémon, not a refusal to battle.
- **HM Usage:** HMs are used from the party menu. Fainted Pokémon can use field moves.
- **PC Interaction:** Stand directly below the PC, face up, and press 'A'.
- **Surfing:** Not all `ground` tiles adjacent to `water` are valid starting points.
- **Puzzle Resets:** Leaving and re-entering a floor resets all boulders to their original positions.
- **Data Trust:** The map XML data is the ultimate source of truth for traversal.
## B. Tile Glossary & Movement Rules
- `ground`: Standard walkable tile.
- `grass`: Wild Pokémon encounters.
- `water`: Requires SURF.
- `impassable`: Wall.
- `ledge`: One-way traversal. Can only be jumped DOWN from the tile directly above. Acts as a wall from all other directions.
- `elevated_ground`: Walkable, different elevation. It is NOT possible to step down from an `elevated_ground` tile to an adjacent `ground` tile unless using a `steps` tile.
- `steps`: Allows movement between `ground` and `elevated_ground` in both directions.
- `boulder_switch`: Floor switch for boulders.
- `boulder_barrier`: Impassable barrier linked to a boulder switch.
- `cleared_boulder_barrier`: A former barrier, now acts as `ground`.
- `hole`: Drops to a lower floor. Pushing a boulder into one causes it to appear on the floor below.
- `spinner`: Forces movement.
- `ladder_up` / `ladder_down`: Warps between floors.
- `cuttable`: A tree that can be removed with the HM Cut.

# II. Battle Intel
## A. Type Effectiveness Chart (Verified)
- **Super Effective (2x):** Psychic > Ghost, Poison; Ghost > Psychic; Electric > Rock, Water; Flying > Grass, Poison, Fighting; Ice > Ground, Grass, Flying, Dragon; Ground > Poison, Fire, Electric, Rock, Ground; Rock > Fire, Ice, Flying, Bug; Fighting > Normal, Rock, Ice; Water > Fire, Ground, Rock; Grass > Water, Ground, Rock; Bug > Grass, Poison, Psychic; Poison > Grass, Bug
- **Not Very Effective (0.5x):** Normal !> Rock; Electric !> Grass, Electric, Dragon; Rock !> Psychic; Psychic !> Psychic; Poison !> Poison, Ground, Rock, Ghost; Ice !> Water, Ice, Fire; Fighting > Poison, Flying, Psychic, Bug; Water !> Water, Grass, Dragon; Grass !> Fire, Grass, Poison, Flying, Bug, Dragon
- **Immune (0x):** Flying immune to Ground; Ground immune to Electric; Ghost immune to Normal, Fighting
- **Correction:** Psychic-type moves deal NEUTRAL (1x) damage to Rock-type Pokémon.

# III. Tool Development & Debugging
- **`gem_pathfinder_v2` Status:** The tool is currently bugged and unreliable. It has repeatedly failed to generate valid paths, often suggesting moves into impassable tiles. I am actively working on fixing it.
- **`puzzle_strategist_agent` Status:** The agent has proven reliable, correctly identifying an unsolvable puzzle on Victory Road 1F.
- **Debugging Principle:** Trust direct, in-game evidence over personal assumptions. When a tool fails after being corrected, re-evaluate the map data and my own understanding to find the true obstacle and form a new plan.
- **Lesson on Confirmation Bias:** I must be wary of confirmation bias. I previously wasted time assuming a path was blocked because my tools were flawed and my understanding of game mechanics was incorrect. I must actively try to disprove my own assumptions and be more willing to change my strategy when my tools contradict my beliefs.
