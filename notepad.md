# Battle Notes
- Electric is ineffective vs. Ground (Geodude, Sandshrew).
- Grass is 4x effective vs. Rock/Ground (Geodude).
- Electric is NOT very effective vs. Bug/Grass (Paras), or Grass/Poison (Oddish, Bellsprout).

# Dungeon Notes & Traps
- **Mt. Moon 1F:** The ladder at (26, 16) is a one-way trap leading back to 1F.
- **Mt. Moon B1F:** The ladder at (18, 12) appears to be a one-way path up from B2F.

# Game Mechanics
- **Dialogue:** A single 'A' press advances to the next dialogue box. 'B' can dismiss dialogue.
- **Defeated Trainers:** Some defeated trainers act as impassable obstacles.
- **Elevation Rule (FINAL):** `ground` and `elevated_ground` tiles are on completely separate planes. Movement between them is IMPOSSIBLE unless a `steps` tile connects them.
