# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Challenge the Pokémon League.
- **Secondary:** Obtain Extremespeed Dratini (Dragon's Den).
- **Tertiary:** Get Master Ball (New Bark Town).
- **Immediate:** Deposit a Pokemon at Blackthorn PC.

# Current Status (Turn 18411)
- **Location:** Dragon's Den 1F (3, 3).
- **Action:** Re-triggering warp to (5, 13).
- **Reasoning:** 
    - Pressing 'A' failed. The ladder is a step-warp.
    - I am standing on it, so I must step off (Down) and step back on (Up) to trigger it.
- **Goal:** Reach (5, 13), then (5, 15) to Warp to B1F.

# Plan
1. Step Down to (3, 4).
2. Step Up to (3, 3) (Trigger Warp to 5, 13).
3. From (5, 13), walk Down to (5, 15).
4. Warp to B1F.
5. Surf to Shrine.
6. Get Dratini.

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Obstacle. Requires HM06 + Badge.
- **Buoy:** Obstacle.
- **Lava/Magma:** (None here).
- **Ice:** (None here).
- **Warp Carpets:** Some (like Dragon's Den 1F exit) may be arrival-only or directional.

# Lessons
- **Menu Navigation:** Always verify cursor position.
- **Map Reading:** Verify tile types (Buoy vs Whirlpool).
- **Warps:** If a warp doesn't trigger, try different approach angles or assume it's one-way.
