### Previous Accomplishments
- Cleared Sprout Tower.
- Defeated Falkner.
- Crossed Union Cave.
- Hint: The Charcoal Man's Pokemon can use CUT.
- **Gym Strategy**: Use Garnet's Ember to sweep Bug-type Pokemon.
- **Gym Trainers**: Twins (Defeated), Bug Catcher Al (Defeated), Bug Catcher Benny (Defeated).
- Note: The path South from (8, 29) to (8, 35) is a dead end.
- Note: The path South from (2, 29) connects back to the entrance at (3, 42). Re-investigate for Farfetch'd.
- Critical Insight: The map is 30 tiles wide. I have only explored the West side (X < 9). I need to explore the East side (X > 9) to find the Farfetch'd.
- Task: Locate Farfetch'd West of the Apprentice.
- Farfetch'd Location: Suspected West of Apprentice (X < 7).
- Discovery: Mental Map XML indicates tiles (9, 35) and (10, 35) are walkable (TYPE_3fe2). The 'Dead End' marker at (8, 35) is likely incorrect. I must investigate this path.
