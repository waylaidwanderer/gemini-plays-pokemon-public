# Blocked Routes (Verified)
- Central City: Vertical wall at X=9 (Rows 34-37). Cliff at Row 30.
- Plateau Access: Row 29 is a clear East-West path from X=19 to X=2, bypassing the Row 30 cliff and city walls.
- Southern Corridor: Row 47/48 provides a path from the east side (X=19) to the west beach (X=2), bypassing the central maze.
- Row 50 Cliff: Impassable wall from X=12 to X=19.

# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The Great Northern Buoy Loop (Verified)
- Plan:
  1. Use Super Repel. [DONE]
  2. Navigate to (19, 30) and Surf. [DONE]
  3. Navigate to (27, 29) to reach the eastern channel. [IN PROGRESS]
  4. Navigate North to Row 6.
  5. Navigate West through the X=22 gap at (22, 6) to (21, 6).
  6. Navigate South to Row 11, then West to land at (16, 11).
  7. Walk to (14, 10).
- Status: At (0, 29) on Route 41 surfing.
- Reasoning: The buoy walls have a confirmed gap at (22, 6). Accessing the eastern channel (X=27) is the only way to reach that gap. The transition from Cianwood (29, 29) leads to Route 41 (0, 29).

# General Lessons
- City Layouts: In Johto cities like Cianwood, horizontal paths (Rows) often bypass vertical blockades (Walls) even if they look like a maze. Always check the full length of a Row for gaps.
