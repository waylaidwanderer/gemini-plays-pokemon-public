# Gem's Strategic Playbook (Post-Critique Revision)

## Current Objective & Plan
- **Primary Goal:** Defeat Brock and earn the Boulder Badge.
- **Current Task:** Train FURYFIST and NIGHTSHADE to the level cap (12) on Route 2.
- **Plan:**
  1. Hypothesis: Defeating Brock is the trigger to open Route 3. Plan: Train FURYFIST and NIGHTSHADE to the level cap (12) on Route 2, then challenge Brock.

## Core Lessons (Hard Mode)
- **EXPLORE FIRST:** Don't assume I'm stuck. Systematically explore all reachable paths before creating complex tools.
- **TRUST THE DATA:** If the game state says a path is 'Reachable: No', it is blocked. Find the trigger; don't force it.
- **SMART TRAINING:** Switch out Pokémon *before* they are at critical HP to prolong training sessions and avoid constant retreats.
- **WKG DILIGENCE:** Log map transitions immediately.
