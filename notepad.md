## III. Area & Navigation Insights

### Tile Traversal Rules (Verified)
- **Objects are impassable:** All map objects (items, trees, signs, defeated trainers etc.) act as walls.
- **WALL:** Impassable.
- **FLOOR:** Traversable.
- **TALL_GRASS:** Traversable, triggers wild encounters.
- **LEDGE:** One-way downward traversal.
- **FLOOR_HOP_*_LEDGE:** One-way traversal in the specified direction.
- **COUNTER:** Impassable.
- **DOOR/CAVE:** Warp tile, triggered by movement.
- **MART_SHELF/BOOKSHELF/TV/RADIO/PC/TOWN_MAP/WINDOW/PAINTING:** Impassable scenery.
- **WATER/CUT_TREE/BUOY:** Impassable.
- **PILLAR:** Impassable.
- **VOID:** Impassable.
- **WARP_CARPET_*: Warp tile, direction-specific.
- **FRUIT_TREE:** Impassable object, may yield items.
- **LADDER:** A warp tile, triggered by movement (not by pressing 'A'). Can be one-way or two-way.
- **STATUE:** An impassable scenery object.

### Sprout Tower Layout
- The central pillar on the first and second floors is generally impassable, but can be navigated around.
- On the second floor, the eastern and western sides are connected by a path that goes around the defeated Sage at (9, 14).
- The third floor has gaps in the central pillar, allowing free east-west movement.
- The ladder at (10, 14) on the second floor is a one-way warp *down* from the third floor. It cannot be used to go up.
- To exit the tower from the top, one must ascend to the third floor, cross from east to west, and then descend using the western ladders.

## IV. Future Plans & Untested Hypotheses

- **Hypothesis:** Can Onix learn Flash (HM05)?
- **Current Objective Plan:** My previous attempts to exit Sprout Tower via the eastern side have failed. The new plan is to thoroughly explore the western side of the third floor to find the correct exit path. I will start by exploring the northern section.
