### Strategic Reflection (Turn 8719)
- **Status**: Stuck in Goldenrod for ~100 turns.
- **Issue**: Oscillating between East/West without clearing the "fog of war".
- **Insight**: The North-East (Flower Shop) is a cul-de-sac. The Central North Wall seems solid. The only remaining option is the North-West quadrant, which is largely "unseen".
- **Action Plan**: 
    1. Return to Main Street (y=10).
    2. Move West to x=6.
    3.Systematically explore North from there, hugging the West edge.

### Navigation Notes
- **Location**: Goldenrod City North.
- **Goal**: Reach Route 35 Gatehouse.
- **Status**: Exiting Name Rater's House.
- **Correction**: The Route 35 Gatehouse is likely at (29, 8) (East of the Gym), NOT on the main street.
- **Plan**:
    1. Move East past the Gym (24, 7).
    2. Locate the Gatehouse entrance at (29, 8).

### Map Structure
- **Name Rater**: (15, 7).
- **Gym**: (24, 7).
- **Route 35 Gatehouse**: ~ (29, 8).

### Quest Chain: SquirtBottle
