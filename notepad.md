# Radio Tower Crisis (Started Turn 8588)
- **Primary Objective**: Clear Team Rocket from the tower and restore normal broadcasts.
- **Progress**: 1F and 2F cleared. 3F sweep in progress.
- **Strategy (HOW)**:
    1. Floor-by-floor sweep (1F -> 5F).
    2. Defeat all Rocket Grunts and Executives.
    3. Find the Director (5F/Basement).
    4. Pass the quiz on 1F for the Radio Card.
    5. POST-SWEEP: Re-verify 1F for any missed trainers (suggested by overwatch).
- **Executive Battles**: Use `battle_strategist_v2`.

# Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR**: Standard traversable.
- **WALL**: Impassable.
- **COUNTER**: Impassable. Interact from adjacent tile facing the counter.
- **WARP_CARPET_DOWN**: Map transition.
- **ICE**: Sliding movement until hitting an obstacle.
- **LADDER/STAIRS**: Warp points.
- **NPC/Item Sprites**: Walls; stop sliding.

# Completed Badges
- Zephyr, Hive, Plain, Fog, Storm, Mineral, Glacier.

# Navigation Notes
- **Counter Interaction**: Face the counter, not the NPC.
- **Fly Map (Goldenrod)**: From New Bark Town, 4 Ups and 6 Lefts. Menu is "sticky"; use discrete presses or `fly_to_v1`.
- **PC Storage**: SHUCKIE (Lv15), ROCKY (Lv6), EGG (Lv5), XFDW (Lv16), FRITTATA (Lv5).

# Reflection & Lessons Learned
- **Turn 8725**: 50-turn reflection. Sweep of 1F and 2F complete. 3F has multiple trainers. Goal is to reach 5F. No deferred tasks identified. Map and tools are up to date. Foundational assumption: Progress is achieved by defeating Rockets floor-by-floor to reach the Director.
- **Turn 8737**: Corrected turn number tracking error. Verified battle progress against Grunt at (5, 1). Calcifer (Lv40 Typhlosion) remains the primary attacker due to significant level advantage.
- **Turn 8740**: Responding to switch prompt. Calcifer is dominant; no switch needed.
