# Battle Strategy: Suicune
- Status: Leading with XENON (Gastly).
- Overworld: The Route 42 encounter is a scripted fleeing event, not a battle. Mean Look is not required here.
- Scripted Battle (Tin Tower): Focus on status (Hypnosis/Sleep Powder) and chip damage. Avoid KO.
- Roaming Battle: Use Mean Look immediately to prevent escape.
- Team: GNEISS (Graveler) for bulk, Calcifer (Typhlosion) for Thunderpunch, KIMCHI (Gloom) for Sleep Powder.
