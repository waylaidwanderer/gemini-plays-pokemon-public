# Suicune Quest Strategy (Crystal)
- Quest Phase Start: Turn 27180
- Current Status: Re-evaluating sighting triggers. Sage at Gatehouse (7, 10) mentioned the tower shaking at Turn 27084. Need to verify if sightings on Route 42 and 36 are truly missing or if progress is stalled elsewhere.
- Key Items: Clear Bell (Acquired)
- Prerequisite Strategy: Eusine must be defeated at Cianwood City north shore. (Status: Verified).
- Route 42 Trigger: (26, 15) - Small clearing with 3 Apricorn trees.
- Route 36 Trigger: (35, 9) - Near the junction where Sudowoodo was.
- Final Encounter: Tin Tower (static battle) after all wild sightings and Wise Trio battle.

## Battle Strategy (Wise Trio)
- Sage Gaku: Noctowl (32), Flareon (32). Counter: GNEISS (Rollout/Earthquake).
- Sage Masa: Noctowl (32), Vaporeon (32). Counter: KIMCHI (Sleep Powder) or Calcifer (Thunderpunch).
- Sage Koji: Noctowl (32), Jolteon (32). Counter: GNEISS (Earthquake).

## Capture Strategy (Suicune)
- Hypothesis: Suicune is a static encounter in Tin Tower (Crystal) at Lv40.
- Lead: XENON (Gastly) Lv21 (Hypnosis, Night Shade).
- **CRITICAL RISK:** Xenon is severely underleveled. Suicune will likely outspeed and KO Xenon. Consider training or using items.
- Items: 43 Great Balls, 1 Ultra Ball.

## Lessons Learned
- Suicune Quest (Crystal): Sages in Tin Tower 1F telling lore indicates progress. If they don't battle, a sighting is missing.
- Gatehouse Sages: The Sage at (4, 6) only checks for the Clear Bell. The Sage at (7, 10) tracks Suicune sighting progress.
- Flight Check: Always verify destination city before confirming Fly.
- Wise Trio: Battle sequence is the final gate to Suicune in the Tin Tower.
