### History & Completed Quests

    - **Dance Theater:** Defeated all 5 Kimono Girls. Received HM03 (Surf) from Gentleman.
- **Pending Needs:**
    - Pokemon to learn Surf (Sentret in PC?).
    - Withdraw Mom's Super Potions.
- **Burned Tower Layout:**
    - Divided into North/South by a wall at y=11 (West side) and y=11 (East side?).
    - Divided into East/West by a wall at x=13 (North side).
    - **Path to Rival:** Rival is at (8, 9) (North-West section). Access seems to be via a gap on the far West side (x < 5).
    - **Hazards:** Holes at (5, 14), (7, 15), (15, 14). Watch your step!
