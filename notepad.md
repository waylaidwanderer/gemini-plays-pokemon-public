# Strategy: Rising Badge (Gym Leader Clair)
- Tactical Plan: Use Xenon's Night Shade for fixed damage. Gneiss for physical bulk and STAB Earthquake. Calcifer's Thunderpunch for neutral coverage.
- Training Goal: Level Xenon and Kimchi to 30+ in Route 45 grass.

# Strategy: Johto League Training
- Method: Switch-training. Lead with Kimchi or Xenon to share EXP, then switch to finisher (Gneiss/Calcifer).
- Efficiency: Grind in Route 45 grass (4,12)-(5,12).
- Resource Management: Return to Blackthorn PC via FLY when Xenon's Night Shade or Gneiss's Earthquake PP is depleted, or when HP is critical.
- Grinding Session 1: Started Turn #31060 (Tuesday, Jan 6, 2026).

# Ground-Type Safety Protocol (Lethal Threat)
- Problem: Xenon (Poison/Ghost) is weak to Ground. Magnitude 10/Earthquake are OHKO threats.
- Solution: NEVER lead or switch Xenon into Ground-types (Geodude, Graveler, Donphan, Gligar) if they are likely to use a Ground move.
- Safe Alternative: Use Icarus (Immune) or high-level finishers (Gneiss/Calcifer) to handle Ground-types.
- Ground Move Resistances:
  - Icarus (Flying): Immune (0x).
  - Kimchi (Grass/Poison): Neutral (1x).
  - Ravioli (Water): Neutral (1x).
  - Gneiss (Rock/Ground): Weak (2x).
  - Calcifer (Fire): Weak (2x).
  - Xenon (Ghost/Poison): Weak (2x).

# Key NPC Locations & Gifts
- Dana (Lass): Route 38. Has a gift. (Turn #31604)

# Battle Strategies & Observations
- Night Shade: Deals fixed damage equal to user level. Cannot hit Normal-types.
- Sleep Powder: Effective for neutralizing threats before switching. Note: Encountered "It didn't affect" on wild Graveler (Turn #31726). Investigating cause (potential immunity or item).
- Type Immunities: Ghost-types (Xenon) immune to Normal/Fighting moves (e.g., Selfdestruct, Quick Attack).
- Move Mechanics: Selfdestruct is used by Graveler/Geodude; Xenon is immune. Hypnosis/Sleep Powder are effective for safe switches.
