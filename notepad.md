# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement (acting as a ledge). Passable from SOUTH to NORTH.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at Row 15 (X=3-17).
- ROCK: Smashable rocks act as WALLs.
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
## Strategy: The Triple S-Curve
Reach (14, 10) by crossing internal walls at specific gaps.
1. Move to Row 33/32 and cross X=11 and X=9 walls (Gaps at 11, 33 and 9, 33).
2. Move North along X=6 to Row 24 and cross X=5 wall (Gap at 5, 24).
3. Move South along X=4 to Row 35 and cross X=3 wall (Gap at 3, 35).
   - Detour Smashable Rock at (4, 25) via X=5 or X=6 corridor.
4. Move North along X=2 corridor to Row 12.
5. Move East along Row 12 to (14, 12) and North to (14, 10).

# Progress Notes
- Verified: Row 33/32 is a clear path from X=12 to X=6.
- Verified: Row 24 is a clear path from X=6 to X=4.
- Verified: Row 35 is a clear path from X=4 to X=2.
- Verified: X=2 corridor is clear from Row 35 to Row 12.
- Verified: Row 12 is clear from X=2 to X=14.
- Consistently Blocked: All far-southern routes (Row 46-50) and far-eastern sea routes (Row 9-15).
