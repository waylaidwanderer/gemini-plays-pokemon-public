*   Pewter City (ID: 2) at (19,23)

*   **Tertiary Goal:**

# Gameplay Notes & Strategy
## Navigation & Exploration
*   **CRITICAL:** Trust the **annotated screen** for immediate obstacles over map memory if there's a conflict.
*   The North map connection from Route 3 (e.g., (58,1)) leads to the *lowest tier* of 'Route 4 (Before Mt. Moon)' at (8,18), not into Mt. Moon 1F (Western side). This route is a loop if trying to access upper Route 4 tiers or the western Mt. Moon entrance for traversal.
*   When on Route 4 (Before Mt. Moon) upper tiers, navigate eastward by descending ledges.
*   The Super Nerd at Mt. Moon B2F (30,12) requests a fossil; he does not provide one.

## Battle Strategy
*   Improve precision in battle menu navigation.
*   Be mindful of type matchups and PP conservation.
*   **Risk Assessment:** Avoid switching in Pokémon with critically low HP against opponents that can KO them.

## ROM Hack Specifics
*   **General Changes:** Old Rod (Viridian Mart), HMs forgettable/menu use, TMs repurchasable, Trade evos by level.
*   **Type Matchup Changes:** Ghost (Special) SE vs Psychic. Bug no longer SE vs Poison.
*   **Stat Boosts:** Pikachu, Farfetch’d, Venomoth, Onix.
*   **Level Caps:** Misty (Starmie Lv21 -> Cap 21), Lt. Surge (Raichu Lv28 -> Player Cap 24).

## PC Interaction Notes
*   Pewter City PC is on the far right (east side) of the Pokecenter, interact from below (e.g., from (14,5) to use PC at (14,4)).
*   'SOMEONE's PC' is for Pokémon Storage. This is where you withdraw/deposit Pokémon.
*   'Gem's PC' is for Item Storage.
*   **CRITICAL MISTAKE LOG:** Spent ~50 turns fumbling PC interactions in Pewter Pokecenter due to: 
    1. Misidentifying the PC location (tried non-PC terminal, Link Receptionist).
    2. Forgetting SIR was in Box 3 and repeatedly trying Box 1 (then later incorrectly assuming Box 3 again after depositing WIGGLES there).
    3. Misunderstanding menu flow (e.g., accessing Item Storage via 'Gem's PC', getting stuck on 'WITHDRAW PKMN' screen).
    4. Repeatedly pressing 'A' on static menu screens expecting a different outcome.
    *Lesson: Slow down in menus, consult notepad for critical info (like PC box numbers, if accurately recorded!), and don't assume repeated actions on a non-responsive menu will work. If a box's contents don't match expectations, re-verify the box number or check other boxes methodically.*

# Agent Development Plan
*   **`item_finder_reminder_agent` (USE AS NEEDED):**
    *   **Status:** Defined. Works well.
*   **`rom_hack_mechanics_lookup_agent` (Low Priority - Tested):**
    *   **Status:** Defined. Works as expected.
*   **`team_composition_advisor_agent` (Low Priority - Tested):**
    *   **Status:** Defined. Works as expected.
*   **Agent Usage Review (8/10 agents):**
    *   `hm_advisor_agent` deleted (0 uses).
    *   **Action:** Reduce reliance on `dungeon_navigator_agent` (45 uses) and `next_battle_action_advisor_agent` (18 uses). Attempt manual navigation/battle decisions first.
    *   Review utility of `battle_strategy_agent` (3 uses) and `encounter_optimizer_agent` (1 use) if not used more consistently soon.
*   **`dungeon_navigator_agent` (USE WITH CAUTION):**
    *   **Status:** Defined. High usage noted. Attempt more manual navigation. Review paths or use 'avoid_coordinates' when using.

*   Exited Mt. Moon (eastern exit) onto Route 4 (Before Mt. Moon).
*   Confirmed Route 3 (North) to Route 4 (Before Mt. Moon) (South) map connection forms a loop for Mt. Moon traversal purposes.
*   Tested `rom_hack_mechanics_lookup_agent` and `team_composition_advisor_agent`.
*   Deleted `hm_advisor_agent`.
*   Deposited WIGGLES (Caterpie Lv4) into PC Box 3. Withdrew SIR (Paras Lv13) from PC Box 1.

# Trainer Battle Intel
## Route 3 Trainers
*   Youngster (ID 2) at (11,7) - Defeated.
*   Youngster (ID 3) at (15,5) - Defeated.
*   Cool Trainer F (ID 4) at (17,10) - Defeated.
*   Youngster (ID 5) at (20,6) - Defeated (Blocks path from east on row 6).
*   Youngster (ID 7) at (23,10) - Non-battling (repeated dialogue). His tile (23,10) is `navigable: false`, acting as a physical block, preventing eastward movement on row 10 from (22,10).
*   Youngster (ID 8) at (25,7) - Defeated.
*   Cool Trainer F (ID 9) at (34,11) - **UNDEFEATED**. Blocks path west on row 11.
## Mt. Moon 1F Trainers
*   All encountered trainers defeated.
## Mt. Moon B2F Trainers
*   Rocket Grunt (ID 3) at (16,23) - Defeated.
*   Super Nerd (Rocket ID 4) at (30,12) - Not a battle. Requests a Fossil.
*   Rocket Grunt (ID 5) at (30,18) - Undefeated (was unreachable).
## Route 4 (Before Mt. Moon) Trainers
*   Cool Trainer F (ID 1) - **UNENGAGEABLE / NOT DEFEATED.** Abandoned attempts to battle. (Player choice to avoid unnecessary battle and prevent looping on lower ledges).

# ARCHIVED LOGS (Summarized)
*   **Mt. Moon Exploration:** Successfully navigated Mt. Moon and found eastern exit to Route 4. Noted complexity and segmented nature of B1F/B2F. Super Nerd wants a fossil.
*   **Route 4 (Before Mt. Moon) Navigation:** Initial attempts to navigate Route 4 eastward from Mt. Moon's exit were inefficient due to prematurely jumping down ledges, forcing a loop back via Route 3. The correct path requires staying on the upper tier after exiting Mt. Moon (eastern exit) and heading east.
