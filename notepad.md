# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Stop Team Rocket.
- **Secondary Goal:** Investigate Radio Tower (Team Rocket takeover).
- **Navigation:** Go to Radio Tower (Northwest Goldenrod).
- **Status:** Executing South-West Loop to reach Radio Tower.
- **Plan:**
    1. Navigate South from (18, 4) to (18, 28).
    2. Navigate West to (6, 28).
    3. Navigate North along the West side (x approx 6) to find the Radio Tower entrance (likely Northwest).
    4. Confirmed: The path at (6, 9) does not lead West. The path at (18, 5) does not lead West. This loop is the only remaining option for the Northwest quadrant.

## Key Information
- **Turn 12001:** Rocket Grunt at (31, 10) is a non-battling blocker.
- **Underground:** "No Entry" door at (18, 6) requires a key or switch.
- **Radio Tower:** Rumored to be taken over.

## Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR:** Standard walkable tile.
- **WALL:** Impassable.
- **COUNTER:** Impassable, interactable from adjacent.
- **LADDER:** Warp.

## Reflections (Turn 12001)
- **Execution:** Good immediate responses.
- **Hygiene:** Notepad cleaned up. Grunt behavior noted.
- **Goals:** Clear outcome-focused goals.
- **Hypothesis:** Uniform is needed. If not on a Grunt, maybe it's in the locked room or with a specific NPC I missed.
