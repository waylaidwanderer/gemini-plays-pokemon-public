# Pokémon Crystal Journey

## Current Situation
- **Objective:** Begin the Pokémon Gym Challenge. The first gym is in Violet City.
- **Next Step:** Talk to Mom in New Bark Town before leaving.
- **Status:** I am in New Bark Town, just outside Elm's Lab.

## Long-term Goal
- Become the Pokémon League Champion.

## The Rival
- A red-haired boy named KAINE stole a Totodile from Professor Elm's lab.

## Key Items
- **POKéGEAR:** Received from Mom. Has a Phone feature.
- **POKéDEX:** Received from Professor Oak.
- **POKé BALLS (x5):** Received from Elm's assistant.

## Mechanics & Discoveries
### System Mechanics
- **Stuck on Warp/Event Tile:** If movement is locked after a warp or event, opening the main menu ('Start') and then closing it ('B' or 'EXIT') can resolve the issue.

### Environmental Mechanics
- **Route 29 Ledges:** The western section of Route 29 has one-way ledges preventing eastward travel from that area.
- **Route 46:** This route is a dead-end when approached from the south due to one-way ledges.
- **CUT_TREE:** These small trees are impassable and require the HM 'Cut' to be removed.

### Battle Mechanics
- **Held Items (Berries):** Pokémon can use held Berries to heal themselves in battle.

## Important NPCs
- **Professor Elm:** Gave me Hestia and set me on the path to the Pokémon League.
- **Mom:** Gave me the POKéGEAR. I need to talk to her before leaving.
- **Professor Oak:** Gave me the POKéDEX.
