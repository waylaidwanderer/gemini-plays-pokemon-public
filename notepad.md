# Current Strategy: Return to Red
- **Timestamp:** Turn 26399 (Jan 7, 2026) [Silver Cave Item Rooms]
- **Status:** At (13, 3) on Warp Carpet.
- **Action:** Pressing DOWN to trigger warp to Room 2.
- **Observation:** Stepping ONTO the warp didn't trigger it, so must step OFF/INTO the wall below.
- **Next:** In Room 2, I need to find the entrance to the *Southern* Item Rooms.
- **Hypothesis:** There is surfable water or a path I missed in Room 2 leading to the South.

# Tile Mechanics
- **WARP_CARPET_DOWN:** Must step DOWN onto this tile to trigger warp.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** South-facing Ledge at y=4.
  - **Status:** Surfing at (13, 30) in Room 2.
- **Action:** Navigating to Waterfall base at (11, 30).
- **Plan:**
  1. Move to (11, 30).
  2. Ascend Waterfall at (11, 29).
  3. Explore the area above (Room 2 Upper / Room 3).
- **Hypothesis:** The waterfall is the exit from the Item Rooms loop and leads to Red.
- **Observation:** The Waterfall tiles at y=29 are passable but push the player back (DOWN) if entered without the HM active.
- **Correction:** Must interact (Face Up + Press A) to use HM. Moving into the tile causes a pushback loop.
- **Strategy:** Attempting rapid input (Up+A) to interact before movement/pushback occurs.
- **Correction:** 'Can't use that here' when selecting from menu.
- **Action:** Must interact with the waterfall directly by pressing A while facing it from the overworld.
- **Observation:** Entering the waterfall tile pushes the player back and forces them to face DOWN.
- **Strategy:** Reset facing by moving away and coming back.
- **Plan:** Move DOWN to (11, 31), then move UP to (11, 30) (ensuring Face UP), then press A to trigger HM.
- **Encounter:** Wild Ursaring at (11, 23) in Silver Cave Room 2.
- **Strategy:** Run (Low on balls, saving Master Ball).
- **Observation:** Row 3 connects to the West side. Row 0 connects to the East side (via x=17).
- **Refined Plan:**
  1. Move West to x=3.
  2. Walk South through the gap at (3, 4).
  3. Explore the Southwest area.
