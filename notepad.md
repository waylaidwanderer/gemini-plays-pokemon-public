# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Current Status
- **Location**: Cianwood City (22_9), Inside Pharmacy.
- **Goal**: Get SecretPotion.
- **Status**: Battling Swimmer Kara (Pokemon 2: Starmie).
- **Reasoning**:
  1. **Visual Confirmation**: The screen shows the cursor is **ALREADY on FLAME WHEEL**.
  2. **Action**: Pressing 'A' to execute the move immediately.
  3. **Speed**: Garnet (Lv 40) is faster than Starmie (Lv 20), so I strike first.
  4. **Damage Calculation**: Previous hit did ~40%. Starmie has ~60% left. I need a high roll or a crit to KO.
  5. **Risk**: If Starmie survives, Garnet (15 HP) will likely faint to Bubblebeam/Water Gun.
  6. **Contingency**: "Phoenix Protocol" (Revive Garnet using fodder) is ready.
- **Plan**:
  1. **EXECUTE**: Flame Wheel.
  2. If Starmie faints -> **WIN**.
  3. If Garnet faints -> **REVIVE STRAT**.
  4. Continue North.

### Objectives
- **Primary**: Obtain Mineral Badge (Jasmine).
- **Secondary**: Get SecretPotion (Cianwood).
- **Tertiary**: Train Basil to Lvl 21.

### Notes
- **Cianwood Pharmacy**: Supposed to have the SecretPotion.
- **Gym**: Chuck (Fighting). Weak to Psychic/Flying. Needs Strength (HM04) to reach.
- **Plan**:
  1. Get SecretPotion (Current).
  2. Buy Repels at General Store (22_3).
  3. Surf to Olivine City.
  4. Get HM04 (Strength) from Café.
  5. Climb Lighthouse, Heal Amphy.
  6. Defeat Jasmine (Steel) with Garnet.
  7. Return to Cianwood (Surf), Defeat Chuck, get Fly.
- **Shuckle Guy**: Found at (17, 41) in Cianwood (Map 22_4). Offers a Shuckle to look after.
- **Search Update**: Building at (17, 41) is NOT the Pharmacy. Pharmacy is likely South of the Pokemon Center.
- **Discovery**: Found a previously unnoticed door at (15, 37) in Cianwood.
- **Hypothesis**: This is likely the Pharmacy.
- **Plan**: Navigate to (15, 38) and enter.
