## Lessons Learned
- NPCs act as walls.
- Buildings are often larger than they appear.
- Ledges are one-way (South confirmed impassable from below).
- Menu Navigation: Do NOT mix directional buttons and action buttons in the same turn.
- CRITICAL HITS: Can happen anytime! Stay healthy even during training.
- BATTLE MENUS: Directional inputs (Up/Down) and action inputs (A) must be in separate turns.
