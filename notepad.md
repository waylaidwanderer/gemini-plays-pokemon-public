- TYPE_989e: Door Mat (Likely Blocked/Collision)

### Notes
- **Sudowoodo Strategy**: Interact with the tree on Route 36 to 'activate' the need for the SquirtBottle, then return to Goldenrod Flower Shop.
- **Navigation**: West side of Goldenrod is accessed via the South path near Radio Tower. Alley west of Game Corner is a dead end.
- Navigation: West Road (X=5) status ambiguous (Type ID conflict).
- Navigation: Main Ave (X=13-16) appears blocked at Row 5 by walls, but must be checked.
- Plan: Go East to X=15 (Row 8). Inspect path North.
- If X=15 blocked, re-evaluate X=18 alley or X=5 road.
- System: Python sandbox tools are down. Using manual navigation.
