# Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Acts as a South-facing Ledge (verified). Blocks North movement.
- **Maze Solution:** Access the North-East section by crossing the top corridor at Row 4.
- **Navigation Notes:**
    - Warp at (15, 1) is the exit from Room 1.
    - x=14 corridor leads directly to the warp.
    - Other Eastern corridors (x=16, x=19) might be accessible from different points or are dead ends.
