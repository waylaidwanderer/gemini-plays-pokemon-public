# Strategy Lessons
- Buoy Maze: The buoy spiral is a trap designed to block access from the east. The landing spot (14, 10) is only reachable via the western channel or a very specific path through the inner buoys.
- Land Route Efficiency: When water navigation is complex, look for land-based corridors (like X=2) that bypass the obstacles.
- Menu Discipline: Slow down during menu navigation to avoid entering Options or Pokemon stats accidentally. Verify the cursor position before pressing A.

# Suicune Quest Strategy: 'The Buoy Spiral to North Plateau'
- Observation: The north plateau at (7, 4) is isolated by walls and ledges. The only access is by water from the north-east, navigating a spiral of buoy walls.
- Confirmed Spiral Route:
    1. Surf at (27, 44) onto (28, 44).
    2. Sail North to (28, 10), then Left to (26, 10) (Gap 1).
    3. Sail South to (26, 16), then Left to (22, 16) (Gap 2).
    4. Sail North to (22, 14), then Left to (19, 14) (Gap 3).
    5. Sail North to (19, 11), then West past X=17 (Wall 7 ends at Y=12).
    6. Land at (14, 10) or (16, 11).
    7. Walk to Suicune sighting area at (7, 4).
- Preparation: Lead with XENON (Haunter) for Hypnosis. Use SUPER REPEL once on water.
