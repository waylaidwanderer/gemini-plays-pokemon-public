# Quest Log
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Status:** Exploring Mt. Silver Cave 1F.
- **Next:** Traverse Cave to Red.

# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Location:** Silver Cave Room 1.
- **Status:** Testing Southbound Exit (Col 8).
- **Action:** Navigate to (8, 34) and attempt to move South.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Row 23 is a wall from Col 1-10, forcing me to cross East to Col 12+ to pass South.
  2. From Col 12, Row 26 allows crossing back West to Col 8.
  3. Col 8 is the only column that reaches Row 34 (others blocked by walls at Row 33).
  4. (8, 34) is a "FLOOR_UP_WALL" tile. I hypothesize this specific tile is traversable Southbound (a hidden ledge or path), allowing access to the bottom corridor (Row 35) and the West Edge (Col 0).
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.

# Tile Mechanics
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN:** One-way South.
- **LEDGE_HOP_LEFT:** One-way Left.
- **WARP_CARPET:** Step on to exit map.
- **CUT_TREE:** Obstacle unless Cut is used.
- **PIT:** Drops player to floor below.
- **LADDER:** Transitions between floors.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Walkable from South/Sides. Northbound exit is BLOCKED (Verified at 8,14). Acts as a one-way ledge preventing Northward movement.
- **BUOY:** Water boundary/Wall.

# Reflection (Turn 25132)
