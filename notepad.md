# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement (acting as a ledge). Passable from SOUTH to NORTH.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at Row 15 (X=3-17).
- ROCK: Smashable rocks act as WALLs.
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- Started: Turn 49630
## Strategy: The S-Curve Bypass
Reach (14, 10) by crossing internal walls at specific gaps.
1. Move North to (18, 45) and West to (12, 45).
2. Move North along X=12 to (12, 33).
3. Move West through gap at (9, 33) to (6, 33).
4. Move North along X=6 to (6, 24).
5. Move West through gap at (5, 24) to (4, 24).
6. Move North along X=4 to (4, 22).
7. Move West through gap at (3, 22) to (2, 22) (Western Corridor).
8. Move North along X=2 to (2, 12).
9. Move East along Row 12 to (14, 12) and North to (14, 10).

# Progress Notes
- Verified: (18, 46) is a FLOOR gap in the Row 46 ledge.
- Verified: Row 33 gap at (9, 33) crosses X=9 wall.
- Verified: Row 24 gap at (5, 24) crosses X=5 wall.
- Verified: Row 22 gap at (3, 22) crosses X=3 wall.
- Verified: Row 12 is a clear horizontal path from X=5 to X=14.
- Blocked: Row 34 ledge (X=6-8) blocks SOUTH movement from Row 33.
- Blocked: (4, 25) is a smashable rock (acts as WALL).
