# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026 (Turn #12392)

### Current Task
- **SquirtBottle Run**: Return to Goldenrod Flower Shop via Route 35 Gatehouse.

### Quest Log
- **Badges**: Zephyr, Hive, Plain.
- **Party**: All Healthy.
- **Mail Quest**: Active.
- **Sudowoodo**: Inspected at Turn 12797 ("It's a weird tree. It wiggles when touched.").

### Strategic Notes
- **Navigation**: Heading back to Goldenrod City via Route 36 Gatehouse.
- **SquirtBottle**: Now that the tree is inspected, the Flower Shop sister should give the bottle.
- **Floria**: Likely back at the Flower Shop or will appear after watering the tree.

### Tile Types
- **TYPE_3fe2**: Walkable Ground/Grass (Safe)
- **TYPE_2889**: Obstacle (Wall/Tree)
- **TYPE_fed7**: Mixed (Benches/Obstacles & Gaps).
- **Navigation Constraint**: Route 35 East is separated from Goldenrod Gatehouse by a fence. Must use the West side (via National Park) to reach the Gatehouse from the North.
- Navigation Update: The right side of the Route 35 Gatehouse (approx x=13) appears to be an exit-only or blocked path. The main entrance is likely on the left side (approx x=10).

- Status Update: Currently out of Poké Balls. Need to restock at next opportunity.
- Navigation Update: Tree at (11, 5) is NOT cuttable (just a wall).
- Active Navigation Plan: Return to Goldenrod Flower Shop.
