# Johto Progression: The Rock Smash Quest
## Primary Goal: Obtain TM08 Rock Smash
- **Status:** Fisher at (44, 9) gives post-gift dialogue but TM08 is not in Bag.
- **Quest Started:** Turn 50407.
- **Hypothesis 1:** TM08 is stored in the PC.
- **Hypothesis 2:** Trigger requires talking to Flower Shop clerk in Goldenrod.
- **Hypothesis 3:** NPC (Fat Man) only appears after certain conditions (e.g., map refresh).
- **Strategy:**
  1. Fly to Violet City and check PC storage for TM08. (Current Task)
  2. If not found, Fly to Goldenrod and visit the Flower Shop.
  3. If still missing, return to Route 36 and enter/exit a gatehouse to refresh NPCs.

## Secondary Goal: Trigger Suicune Sighting in Cianwood City
- **Location:** (14, 10) in Cianwood City.
- **Status:** Blocked by boulders. Rock Smash is mandatory.
