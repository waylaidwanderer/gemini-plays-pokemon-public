### Strategic Reflection (Turn 8719)
- **Status**: Stuck in Goldenrod for ~100 turns.
- **Issue**: Oscillating between East/West without clearing the "fog of war".
- **Insight**: The North-East (Flower Shop) is a cul-de-sac. The Central North Wall seems solid. The only remaining option is the North-West quadrant, which is largely "unseen".
- **Action Plan**: 
    1. Return to Main Street (y=10).
    2. Move West to x=6.
    3.Systematically explore North from there, hugging the West edge.

### Navigation Notes
- **Location**: Goldenrod City North (West Side).
- **Goal**: Locate Exit to Route 35.
- **Status**: Trapped in a pocket at (7, 6).
- **Observation**:
    - North (Row 5): Blocked.
    - West (x=5): Blocked.
    - East (x=8): Blocked by Sign.
    - South: Open back to Row 9.
- **Plan**:
    1. Move South to Row 9/10.
    2. Move East to Main Street (x=16) or Gym area (x=24).
    3. Look for a gap in Row 5/6 to head further North.
- **Hypothesis**: The path to Route 35 is likely on the main street (x=16) or near the Gym.

### Map Structure
- **Underground Exit**: (9, 6).
- **Gym**: (24, 7).
- **Blockade**: Row 5 seems to be the northern limit of this section. Route 35 is North of this.
