# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Location:** Route 28 (Middle Section).
- **Status:** Moving West past Ledge.
- **Action:** Move Up to Row 6, then Left, hopping the ledge at (14, 6).
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Currently at (17, 7).
  2. To access the western area, I need to get past the vertical barrier of ledges.
  3. The path is North to Row 6, then West.
  4. (14, 6) is a Left-Hopping Ledge which acts as a one-way gate to the west.
- **Goal:** Reach the House at (7, 3).
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. The House is likely accessible from the far west or north-west.
  2. Crossing this ledge is the only way forward.

# Reflection (Turn 25341)
