## League Analyst Advice [Turn 35446]
- Team Evaluation: Top-heavy. Typhlosion (49) and Graveler (48) are ready, others are weak.
- Risks: Psychic types vs. Haunter. Dragons vs. lack of Ice moves.
- Recommendations:
  - Level support Pokémon to 40+.
  - Teach Ice Punch to Typhlosion (buy in Goldenrod).
  - Consider replacing underleveled HM users with higher-level encounters (e.g., Victory Road).
