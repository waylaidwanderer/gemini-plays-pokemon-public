# Gem's Log: Pok√©mon Yellow Legacy - Hard Mode

## I. Current Status & Active Plans

### A. Pok√©mon Party (Turn 2574)
1. SPROUT (ODDISH): Lv10 (24/32 HP, EXP: 624) | Moves: TACKLE (7 PP), POISONPOWDER (35 PP), LEECH SEED (5 PP)
2. PIP (PIDGEY): Lv9 (21/27 HP, EXP: 523) | Moves: GUST (15 PP), SAND-ATTACK (15 PP)
3. SPARKY (PIKACHU): Lv12 (38/38 HP, EXP: 1728) | Moves: THUNDERSHOCK (28 PP), TAIL WHIP (30 PP), QUICK ATTACK (30 PP), THUNDER WAVE (20 PP) - AT LEVEL CAP (0 Badges). Visual EXP from NIDORAN‚ôÄ Lv3 (Turn 2578): +25.

### B. Financial Status
- Money: ¬•296

### C. Current Location & Immediate Objective
- Location: Route 22 (ID: 33), at (34,11) (Turn 2574).
- Immediate Objective: Train SPROUT and PIP in the eastern grass patch of Route 22.

### D. Training Priorities
- SPROUT (ODDISH): Lv9 -> Needs significant training for Brock (Rock/Ground). Grass moves super effective. **PRIORITY**
- PIP (PIDGEY): Lv9 -> Needs training.
- SPARKY (PIKACHU): At cap, less effective vs Brock.

<!-- Goals section removed as per system guidance. Goals are tracked in the response structure. -->

## II. Game Mechanics & Rules

### A. Hard Mode Rules
- Battle Style: Set.
- No items allowed in battle.
- Level caps: Pok√©mon cannot exceed cap for current badge count. (0 badges=12, 1=21, 2=24, 3=35, 4=43, 5=50, 6=53, 7=55, 8=65). EXP gain messages for capped Pok√©mon are visual only; no actual EXP is gained.

### B. General Game Changes (Pok√©mon Yellow Legacy)
- HMs: Forgettable, menu-use, not PC-storable. CUT is Bug-type.
- All 151 Pok√©mon obtainable. Trade evos by level.
- Smarter AI, tougher bosses, unlimited enemy PP.
- EXP. All obtainable without special requirements (seems active).

### C. Behavioral Guideline Summary (Internalized from Turn 2261 Critique)
- **Scientific Mindset:** Hypothesize, test, document failures (with attempt counts), avoid repeating failed strategies. Pivot goals if stalled.
- **Risk-Taking:** Be calculated, prioritize progression. Sacrifices okay in battle.
- **Wild Battles:** Run if capped/low HP/PP, unless catching/training. Speed dictates escape.
- **Nicknaming:** Always do it; enjoy the process.
- **Verification:** Trust direct observation over prior knowledge for ROM hack changes. Verify with multiple cases.

### D. Discovered Mechanics
- Poison: 1 HP lost per 4 steps outside battle.
- STAT Experience: Significant stat boosts from battling/leveling.
- PC Log Off: Saves game.
- Evolution: By training.
- Status Conditions: SLP (AWAKENING), BRN (BURN HEAL), PSN (ANTIDOTE), FRZ (ICE HEAL), PAR (PARLYZ HEAL).
- Wild Battle Escapes: Speed-dependent. If lead Pok√©mon's Speed >= wild's, escape is guaranteed. Otherwise, chance increases with attempts.
- Pok√©mon Nicknaming: Always do it when prompted.
- DV Checking: Hold START, then press A on STATS in Pok√©mon menu. (Learned from VIRIDIANCITY_YOUNGSTER2, Turn 1972)
- Party Order: Game may auto-switch lead Pok√©mon in certain battle initiation scenarios (Observed Turn 2572).

### E. Data Management & Logging
- **Battle Logs:** Summarize training progress (e.g., levels gained, key moves learned) rather than logging every individual EXP gain, especially for capped Pok√©mon, to keep notepad concise. Note visual EXP gains for capped Pok√©mon if significant.
- **PP/HP/EXP Tracking:** Rely on Game State Information as the absolute source of truth for Pok√©mon stats (HP, EXP, PP). Notepad entries are for reference/planning but can have discrepancies.

## III. World Knowledge & Exploration

### A. Discovered Tile Types & Movement Rules
- **ground**: Walkable.
- **impassable**: Walls, objects, etc. Not traversable.
- **warp**: Map transition. Activation varies (instant 1x1, or 2-step for larger like exit mats/gatehouses).
- **water**: Requires Surf.
- **grass**: Wild encounters.
- **ledge**: Jump down only. One-way traversal.
- **cuttable**: Tree, requires CUT.
- **Pikachu Movement**: If Pikachu is adjacent in movement direction & player not facing him, 2 presses needed (1st turns, 2nd moves). Normal otherwise.
- **PC Interaction**: Stand below, face up, press A.
- **Item Interaction**: Some items require 'A' interaction.

### B. Verified Type Matchups
- Ghost > Psychic.
- Poison > Bug; Bug !> Poison.

### C. NPC Interaction Log & Key Dialogue
- **Viridian Old Man (ID 5, (20,14) Viridian):** Taught catching, unblocked path N. (Marker ‚úÖ set)
- **Viridian Girl (ID 4, (18,10) Viridian):** Grandpa needs coffee. (Marker üí¨ set)
- **Pewter Gym Guide (Pewter Gym):** Brock's Lead: GEODUDE (Offense, Rock Throw). Other: ONIX (Defense, BIND). Electric harmless vs Ground.
- **Pewter Nidoran House Man (Pewter Nidoran House):** Traded Pok√©mon grow fast but might ignore unskilled trainers; BADGEs help.

## IV. Agent Management

### A. Defined Agents
1.  `level_cap_compliance_checker`
2.  `item_finder_agent`
3.  `wkg_transition_recorder_agent`

5.  `battle_strategist_agent`
6.  `pathfinding_agent`
7.  `exploration_helper_agent`

### B. Active Agent Improvement Tasks (High Priority)
- **`wkg_transition_recorder_agent`:** Update prompt to *mandate* querying WKG for existing nodes using `run_code` with `world_knowledge_graph_json_string` before suggesting new node creation. (Top Priority)
- **`item_finder_agent`:** Remove redundant `player_x`, `player_y` from `agent_input_schema` as agent can derive location from `map_xml_string`. (High Priority)
- **`pathfinding_agent` & `exploration_helper_agent`:** Prompts need significant update to handle ledges correctly. *Current Plan: Defer major fix, continue manual navigation in ledge-heavy areas like Route 22. Re-evaluate agent fix priority if Brock proves too difficult or if significant ledge navigation is required for other pre-Brock objectives.*
- **General for code-enabled agents**: Prompts must clarify use of `run_code` for auto-provided variables (`map_xml_string`, `world_knowledge_graph_json_string`) and how to parse/utilize them effectively.

### C. Future Agent Considerations (To be defined when strategically beneficial)
- **Ledge-Aware Explorer Agent:** Specialized for navigating ledge-heavy areas.
- **Training Spot Suggester Agent:** Input: target Pok√©mon, current location, desired level. Output: suggested map/grass/trainers.
- **Shop Inventory Agent:** Input: city/mart name. Output: items sold & prices.
- **EXP Farming Route Agent:** Input: target Pok√©mon, desired level. Output: optimal routes/areas.

## V. Lessons Learned & Strategic Refinements

### A. Key Learnings from Mistakes
- **NPC Interaction Threshold:** If an NPC interaction fails after 2-3 distinct, well-reasoned attempts, assume they are non-battling, already defeated, or require a different game state, then MOVE ON.
- **Pathing Precision:** Meticulously review Map Memory before committing to movement. Verify current map_id/position from Game State frequently. Cross-reference agent paths with map data, especially for ledges.
- **Agent Reliability:** If an agent is unreliable (e.g., pathfinding over ledges), default to manual planning or `run_code` scripts. Review/fix failing agent prompts ASAP.
- **Flexibility:** Be willing to change secondary/tertiary goals if current approach is stalled.
- **Map Segmentation by Ledges:** Understand that ledges create one-way paths and can isolate map sections.
- **Route 22 Ledge Navigation:** Manual exploration and careful map study are crucial for complex terrain like Route 22 due to agent failures.
- **Notepad `old_text`:** Double-check `old_text` for `replace` actions to avoid failed edits.

### B. Failed Hypotheses Log (Selected)
- VIRIDIANCITY_YOUNGSTER1 (ID 1) at various Viridian locations: Attempted battle ~20+ times (Turns ~1920-1943). Result: Stuck dialogue loop. Conclusion: Interaction bugged or requires unknown condition. Marked üö´.
- `exploration_helper_agent` for Route 22 unseen tiles from (32,12) (Turn 2303): Path led to seen areas/ledges. Attempts: 1.
- `pathfinding_agent` for Route 22 to (12,8) from (32,12), (32,8) (Turns 2305-2307): Invalid ledge jumps. Attempts: 3.

### C. Manual Navigation Plans (When Agents Fail)
- **Route 22 (Current):** All navigation on Route 22 will be manual, focusing on systematically exploring reachable unseen tiles. This is due to repeated `pathfinding_agent` and `exploration_helper_agent` failures with ledges.

## VI. Historical Log & Major Milestones (CONCISE - To be reviewed/archived post-Brock)
- **Startup:** Pallet Town, got SPARKY. Delivered Oak's Parcel, got Pok√©dex.
- **Early Routes & Forest:** Traversed Route 1. Viridian Forest (caught SPROUT, PIP), defeated Bug Catchers.
- **Pewter City Exploration:** Visited Museum (couldn't afford ticket), Nidoran House, Mart. Gathered intel on Brock.
- **Blackout:** Lost to Jr. Trainer in Pewter Gym (Turn 1901). Returned to Viridian Pokecenter.
- **Viridian City NPC Issues:** Encountered bugged/non-battling NPCs (Youngster1, Gambler1).
- **Route 22 Initial Exploration:** Defeated Rival BLAZe (Turn ~2159). Navigational difficulties with ledges.
- **Route 22 Training (Turns 2250+):** Ongoing training for SPROUT and PIP.

## VII. Task List (Active & Pending)

### A. Pre-Brock Tasks (High Priority)
- **Agent Definition Updates (Immediate):**
    - `wkg_transition_recorder_agent`: Update prompt (see IV.B).
    - `item_finder_agent`: Update input schema (see IV.B).
- **Agent Prompt Fixes (Ongoing/Deferred):**
    - `pathfinding_agent` & `exploration_helper_agent` for ledges (see IV.B).
    - General review for code-enabled agents on auto-provided variable usage.
- **Map Markers (This Turn):**
    - Place Route 22 (9,6) Warp marker: üö™ "Used - To Route 22 Gate (5,8) EP:1"
    - Place Route 22 (8,12) Sign marker: ‚ÑπÔ∏è "Sign: ROUTE22_POKEMON_LEAGUE_SIGN"

### B. Post-Brock Task List (To be reviewed/actioned after defeating Brock)
- Review and prioritize agent development ideas (from IV.C).
- Review and summarize/archive older historical log entries from Section VI.
- Finalize any remaining agent prompt fixes from VII.A.
- Place any other pending map markers (e.g., Sign at Route 22 (8,12) - already marked, Ledge at Route 22 (34,8) - already marked).
- Review and potentially delete old/redundant tertiary goal definitions from Section I.E.

## VIII. Reflection Notes (Consolidated)
- **Notepad Maintenance (Critique Turn 2551):** This `overwrite` action addresses the need for consolidation. Will continue to aim for accurate `replace` actions or use `overwrite` for major refactors.
- **Agent `item_finder_agent` (Turn 2551):** Definition needs review for redundant player_x/y input.
- **Agent `capability_checker_agent`:** Deleted (Turn 2641) due to lack of use and to streamline agent list.
