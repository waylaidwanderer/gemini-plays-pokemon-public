# Persistent Knowledge
## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- LADDER: Floor change (e.g. 1F to B1F).
- COUNTER: Face and press A to interact.
- LEDGE: Semi-traversable (jump down).
- WATER: Requires SURF.
- WHIRLPOOL: Requires WHIRLPOOL.
- WATERFALL: Requires WATERFALL.

## Active Quest: Find Granddaughter [Started Turn 37715]
- Clues: Granddaughter is missing; sailor on B1F is looking for his buddy; buddy is "goofing off".
- Progress: Caught a sailor at (30, 6) on B1F who was worried about the Captain. However, the path north on B1F (31, 6) is still blocked by another sailor.
- Strategy: Search all cabins on 1F to find the buddy or another trigger. The granddaughter is likely with the Captain once the path is clear.
- Hypothesis: Catching the sailor on B1F was only part of the trigger; finding the buddy on 1F (sleeping or eating) is required.

## Kanto Strategy
- Goal: Collect 8 Kanto badges.
- Target 1: Lt. Surge (Vermilion City).
- MVP: GNEISS (Graveler) Lv 51. Ground-type immunity to Electric.

## Lessons Learned
- S.S. Aqua sailors block corridors; they "shadow" movements if not triggered to move.
- Super Nerd (26, 9) blocks the x=26 corridor on B1F.
- Map transitions reset NPC positions.
- Path to western 1F is likely via B1F (East 1F -> East B1F -> West B1F -> West 1F).
