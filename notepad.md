# Pokémon Crystal Journey

## Current Plan
- **Objective:** Get back to New Bark Town to investigate the stolen Pokémon.
- **Route:** Find a way out of Cherrygrove City to Route 29, then head east.

## Current Quest
- **A Pokémon has been stolen from Professor Elm's lab!** I need to return to New Bark Town immediately to find out more and help.

## Long-term Goal
- Become the Pokémon League Champion.

## The Rival
- A red-haired boy bumped into me as I was leaving Professor Elm's lab for the first time.
- I suspect he is the one who stole the Pokémon. He seems to be blocking my path west in Cherrygrove City.

## Key Items
- **POKéGEAR:** Received from Mom. Has a Phone feature.
- **POKéDEX:** Received from Professor Oak. Automatically records data on Pokémon.
- **MYSTERY EGG:** Received from Mr. Pokémon. Needs to be taken to Professor Elm.

## Mechanics & Discoveries
### System Mechanics
- **Warp Mechanics:** Some warp tiles may require stepping off of them and then back on to activate.
- **SELECT Button:** Can be used to register a key item for quick use.
### Environmental Mechanics
- **Route 29 Ledges:** The western section of Route 29 has one-way ledges preventing eastward travel from that area.
- **Route 46:** This route is a dead-end when approached from the south due to one-way ledges.
- **CUT_TREE:** These small trees are impassable and require the HM 'Cut' to be removed.
### Battle Mechanics
- **Held Items (Berries):** Some Pokémon can hold items like Berries, which they can use automatically in battle to heal themselves when their HP gets low.
- **Smokescreen:** Lowers the opponent's accuracy.
### Item Effects
- **POTION:** Heals a Pokémon for 20 HP.

## Wild Pokémon Encounters
### Route 29 (Tall Grass)
- **Hoppip** (Lv. 2-3): Knows Splash
- **Sentret** (Lv. 2-3): Knows Tackle
- **Pidgey** (Lv. 2-3): Knows Tackle
- **Rattata** (Lv. 2): Knows Tackle
- **Hoothoot** (Lv. 3): Knows Tackle

## Important NPCs
- **Professor Elm** (New Bark Town): Gave me Hestia and his phone number. A Pokémon was stolen from his lab.
- **Mom** (New Bark Town): Gave me the POKéGEAR.
- **MR. POKEMON** (Route 30): Gave me the MYSTERY EGG.
- **Professor Oak** (met at Mr. Pokémon's House): Gave me the POKéDEX.

## Radio Broadcasts
- **Professor Oak's Pokémon Talk:** Abra may be seen around Route 35.

## Puzzle Solutions
- **Cherrygrove House Lock:** Became stuck at (3, 1). Solution was to turn to face the TV at (2, 1) and interact with it ('A' button). This triggered a text box, and after closing it, movement was restored.
- **Mr. Pokémon's House Exit:** Became stuck on the exit warp at (2, 7). Solution was to press 'Start' to open the menu, then 'B' to close it, which resolved the glitched state and allowed the warp to function.

## Self-Corrections & Failed Hypotheses
- The path to Cherrygrove City is through Route 29. My initial assumption that it was a dead end was incorrect.
