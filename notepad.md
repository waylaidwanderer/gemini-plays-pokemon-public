## Strategy: Reaching Suicune Overworld Sighting
**Start Turn:** 48900 (Quest: Trigger Suicune Overworld Sighting)

Cianwood's geography is a maze of vertical walls and ledges. I am using a terrestrial path to the northern plateau.

### Step-by-Step Execution Plan
1. Walk South to (11, 18), then West to (7, 18) to reach the central corridor.
2. Walk South along the X=7 corridor to (7, 34).
3. Walk West through the Row 34 gap to (2, 34) (West Beach).
4. Walk North along the West Beach Highway (X=2) to (2, 14).
5. Walk East along the Row 14 corridor to (8, 14).
6. Walk North along the X=8 corridor to (8, 12).
7. Walk East along the Row 12 corridor to (14, 12).
8. Walk North to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune sighting.

## Tile Mechanics: Cianwood City
- FLOOR: Standard traversable ground.
- WALL: Impassable barrier.
- WATER: Traversable only with Surf HM.
- BUOY: Impassable water barrier.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way ledge. Blocks DOWN movement (Y to Y+1). Allows UP and East-West movement. (Verified at (6, 46)).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump South. Impassable from the North side.
