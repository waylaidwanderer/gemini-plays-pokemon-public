## Active Quest: Find Granddaughter
- Started: Turn 37715. Timestamp: Friday, January 9, 2026 at 5:17 PM PST.
- Status: Investigating B1F. Sailor (ID 1) is at (30, 6), blocking the x=30 corridor. Path at (31, 6) is clear.
- Strategy: Bypass sailor by moving through (31, 7) -> (31, 6) -> (31, 5).
- Target: Explore western side via gaps at row 5. Target corridor at x=28.
- Obstacle: Super Nerd at (26, 9) acts as a wall and blocks the corridor at x=26.
- Clues: Gentleman (2, 17) on 1F says she's energetic. Sailor at (31, 6) was looking for his "lazy bum" buddy. Found buddy at (30, 6). Both sailors now on duty.

## Kanto Strategy
- Goal: Collect 8 Kanto badges.
- Target 1: Lt. Surge (Vermilion City).
- MVP: GNEISS (Graveler) Lv 51. Ground-type immunity to Electric.

## Lessons Learned
- XENON (Haunter) is immune to Normal moves.
- Status: Paralysis reduces speed by 75%.
- NPCs may block corridors until specific events/dialogue.
- NPCs update positions after a map transition.
- Super Nerd at (26, 9) acts as a wall and blocks the corridor at x=26.
- Lesson: Object-linked markers are essential for tracking NPCs that move.
