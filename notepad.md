# Gem's Gameplay Log & Strategy

## Party & Brock Prep
*   **SPROUT** (Oddish, Lv11): Key for Brock. Goal: Lv12.
*   **PIP** (Pidgey, Lv10): Good utility. Goal: Gain levels.
*   **SPARKY** (Pikachu, Lv12): At level cap (12).
*   **THISTLE** (Nidoran♀, Lv4): Newest member. Goal: Gain levels.

## Current Objective: Training for Brock
*   **Primary Location:** Route 22 (Nidoran, Mankey, Spearow).
*   **Alternative Location:** Route 2 (Untested, may have better encounters).
*   **Strategy:** Level SPROUT to 12 first, then focus on PIP and THISTLE.

## Verified Strategies & Rules
*   **Pre-Adventure Checklist:** ALWAYS heal all Pokémon (HP, PP, Status) at a Pokémon Center before leaving a town or starting a major task.
*   **Efficient Navigation:** Use `pathfinding_agent` for complex routes to avoid wasting time. For simple paths, plan multi-step movements.
*   **Agent Responsibility:** Agents provide plans (`pathfinding_agent`) or analysis (`battle_strategist_agent`). I am responsible for execution (clearing obstacles, making the final battle decision).
