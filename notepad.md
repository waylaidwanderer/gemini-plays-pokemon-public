- LEDGE: One-way movement (usually South).
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable from North.

# Suicune Capture Strategy (Pokemon Crystal)
## Primary Goal: Capture Suicune
- Suicune follows a scripted sequence of sightings before becoming a roamer or stationary battle.
- Sighting 1: Cianwood City (Completed).
- Sighting 2: Route 42 Middle Island (In Progress?). Approach the sprite on the island.
- Sighting 3: Route 36 (Next Target). Approach the sprite near the Sudowoodo spot.
- Final Encounter: Tin Tower. Stationary battle (requires Clear Bell and 3 Ecruteak-area badges).

## Verification Plan: Roamer vs. Sighting
- If Suicune is roaming, its location in the Pokedex will change when crossing map boundaries.
- If Suicune is in sighting mode, it will remain at its scripted location.
- Test: Move to Mahogany Town and back, checking Pokedex Area each time.

## Party Strategy
- XENON (Gastly, Lv18): Lead for Mean Look/Hypnosis.
- KIMCHI (Gloom): Cut.
- Ravioli (Krabby): Surf.

## Items
- Super Repel: Active (approx 180 steps remaining). Use to avoid wild encounters while traveling.
