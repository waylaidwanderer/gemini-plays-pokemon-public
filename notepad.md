# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Active Strategy: The Northern Sea Bypass
The city's internal layout is a maze of one-way ledges (FLOOR_UP_WALL) that block southward travel. The only unobstructed path to the northern plateau (14, 10) is via the northern sea.

1. Run from the current battle at (28, 37). (In Progress)
2. Surf North along column X=28 to Row 9.
3. Move West through the buoy gap at (27, 9).
4. Surf North to Row 8.
5. Surf West along Row 8 to X=14.
6. Surf South to land at (14, 10) and trigger the sighting.

## Verified Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement (Confirmed at Row 46, X=28). Northward passability UNVERIFIED.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement.
- Buoy Gap: (27, 9) is a confirmed passage to the northern sea.
