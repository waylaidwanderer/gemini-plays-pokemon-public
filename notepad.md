# Reflection (Turn 22795)
- **Status:** Box 1 Full (20/20). Cannot catch until Pewter City PC.

- **Goal:** Reach Pewter City. Path North from cave is blocked. Exploring East side.
- **Performance:** Navigation successful. Fisher interaction required correction (positioning).
- **Plan:** Exit House -> Explore South/East for Cut tree or path to Pewter.
