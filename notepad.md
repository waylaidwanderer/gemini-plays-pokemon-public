# Gem's Pokémon Crystal Adventure!

## Current Plan & Strategy
- **Plan:**
  1. Exit Elm's Lab.
  2. Travel west through Route 29 to reach Cherrygrove City.
  3. Find Mr. Pokémon, who lives a little bit beyond Cherrygrove City.

## To-Do List

## Discoveries & Mechanics
- Some trees are 'HEADBUTT_TREE' type, likely for the move Headbutt.
- **Dialogue Triggers:** Some dialogues (like Professor Elm's initial errand speech) might loop until another specific NPC in the room is spoken to. In Elm's Lab, talking to the scientist was required to progress the conversation with Elm.

## World Knowledge & NPCs
- **Route 29:** The main path splits. The lower southern path is blocked by an impassable Youngster at (27, 16). The upper northern path seems to be the correct way forward towards Cherrygrove City, though it has some one-way ledges that can create dead ends.
- **New Bark Town:** A Fisher at (12, 9) mentioned Prof. Elm discovered new Pokémon.
