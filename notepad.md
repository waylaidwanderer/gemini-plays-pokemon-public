# Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR**: Standard traversable tile.
- **WALL**: Impassable barrier.
- **LADDER**: Warp point between floors.
- **WARP_PANEL**: Transport tile (often one-way).
- **BOOKSHELF**: Impassable background object.
- **COUNTER**: Impassable. Interact with NPCs/Items from an adjacent tile.
- **SECURITY_CAMERA / Persian Statue**: Triggers alarms and battles until disabled.
- **NPC/Item Sprites**: All sprites have collision and act as walls.

# Team Rocket Base Investigation (Mahogany Town)
- **Status:** Passwords 'RATICATE TAIL' and 'SLOWPOKETAIL' used. Executive defeated.
- **B1F (3_49):**
  - (19, 11): Secret Switch (Disables Statues).
- **B2F (3_50):**
  - **Structure:** Isolated sections.
  - **Central Section:** Contains Electrode transmitter powering the radio signal.
  - **South-West Room:** Ladder (3, 6) and item (3, 10).
- **B3F (3_51):**
  - (10, 9): Boss Room Door (Opened).
  - (8, 3): Boss Office. Executive defeated at Turn 8361.
  - (7, 2): Murkrow location (likely gives final password).
- **Key Encounters:**
  - **Malice:** Met on B3F West (7, 10). Mentioned Lance's lecture on love/trust.
  - **Rocket Executive:** Defeated on B3F West. He ran off after the battle.

# Strategy (HOW)
1. **Get Final Password:** Talk to the Murkrow in the Executive's office to get the password for the transmitter room.
2. **Shut Down Transmitter:** Return to B2F, open the locked doors at (14, 12) or (15, 12), and neutralize the three Electrode.
3. **Reward:** Speak with Lance to receive HM06 (Whirlpool).

# Lessons Learned
- Map sections can be isolated; use floor transitions to navigate.
- Voltorb sprites on B2F are traps.
- Boss door requires two passwords from grunts on B3F.
- **Path to Boss:** B2F East -> B3F East -> B2F North -> B3F West.
