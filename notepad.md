# Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR:** Standard traversable tile.
- **WALL:** Impassable obstacle.
- **WATER:** Traversable only with Surf.
- **TALL_GRASS:** Traversable, chance of wild encounters.
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN:** One-way movement South. Impassable from other directions.
- **LEDGE_HOP_RIGHT:** One-way movement East. Impassable from other directions.
- **LEDGE_HOP_LEFT:** One-way movement West. Impassable from other directions.
- **CUT_TREE:** Obstacle. Removable with Cut HM.
- **LADDER:** Warps to another map or floor.
- **DOOR:** Warps to another map or interior.
- **Correction:** The "Cape" tip at (50-55, 4) is walled off from the land. The only access is via the water channel at x=56.
- **Correction:** Access to the x=56 water channel is blocked on Route 25 by walls. Must access from Route 24 (Nugget Bridge) East side.
- **Plan:** Return to Route 24 -> Surf East of Bridge -> Head North to (56, 4).
- **Correction:** The path South at x=11 (Route 25) is open (`FLOOR`) and leads to the East side of Route 24 (the grassy area).
- **Plan:** Walk South from (11, 13) to Route 24 -> Surf North from the grassy area to reach the Cape (x=56).
- **Discarded Plan:** No need to loop back to the West side (x=4) since x=11 provides direct access.
