# Quest Logic (Cascade Badge)
1. **Fact:** I possess TM07 (Zap Cannon), which confirms the Power Plant quest is COMPLETE.
2. **Implication:** The Generator is fixed. Misty should be at the Cape (Route 25) or the Gym.
3. **Current Status:** Heading to Cerulean to verify Gym state and Power Plant Manager status.
4. **Plan:**
    - Go to Cerulean City.
    - Check Gym (is Misty there?).
    - If empty, check Power Plant (Route 9) to confirm quest completion dialogue.
    - If complete and Gym empty, return to Route 25 (Cape) and SEARCH THOROUGHLY for Misty.
