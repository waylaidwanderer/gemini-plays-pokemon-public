# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- **Quest Start:** Turn 48900
- **Status:** Executing Southern Bypass (Surf via X=27 channel). Repel active (~185 steps).

## Execution Plan (Southern Bypass)
1. Surf to (12, 21), then East to (27, 21). <- CURRENT TASK
2. Surf South to (27, 51).
3. Land at (24, 51).
4. Walk West to (2, 51), then North to (2, 14).
5. Walk East to (8, 14), then North to (8, 10).
6. Walk East to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

## Strategy: Southern Bypass
The city center is blocked by one-way ledges (Row 34, 46, 48, 50) and walls. To reach the western corridor (X=2), I must Surf around the south end of the map (Row 51). This avoids all city barriers.

## Failed Hypotheses & Lessons
- Island Hop (13, 16): Dead end due to walls at Row 13/15.
- Inner Channel (X=12): Blocked at Row 15 by buoy wall.
- Terrestrial Path (South): Blocked by multiple ledge lines.
- Terrestrial Path (West): Blocked by wall lines at X=11, 9, 5, 3.

## Progress Summary
- All 16 Badges obtained.
- Elite Four/Red defeated.
- Current Focus: Suicune tracking.
