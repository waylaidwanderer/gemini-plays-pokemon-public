# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Active Strategy: House-to-House Search for Rock Smash
The northern plateau (14, 10) is blocked by rocks. I need TM08 Rock Smash to proceed. Advisor says the NPC is typically outside, but I will check all buildings systematically to be sure.

### Search Progress
1. Poke Seer (5, 17): In Progress. Talking to Granny at (2, 3).
2. Photo Studio (9, 31): Next.
3. Pokefan M (17, 33): Outside.
4. Lugia Speech House (15, 37).
5. Pokefan F (10, 46): Outside.
6. Pharmacy (15, 47).
