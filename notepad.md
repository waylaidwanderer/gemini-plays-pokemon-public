# Strategic Goals
1. **Wake Snorlax:** Needs Poke Flute & Power.
   - *Status:* In Lavender Radio Tower. Dialogue was ambiguous ("With that thing...").
   - *Issue:* EXPN Card NOT in Key Items list. "UP-GRADE" is for Porygon.
   - *Hypothesis:* Either EXPN Card is a flag, or I haven't received it yet.
   - *Plan:* Talk to Director again (A) -> Verify receipt -> Exit -> Fly Vermilion -> Tune Radio to 20 -> Wake Snorlax.
   - *Next:* Battle Snorlax -> Enter Diglett's Cave.
2. **Collect Badges:** Thunder (Done), Marsh (Done).
