# Suicune Capture Strategy
- Lead: XENON (Haunter, Lv44).
- Move 1: Hypnosis (Sleep). Accuracy is key.
- Move 2: Night Shade (44 dmg). Suicune (Lv40) has ~120 HP. Use twice for Red health.
- Move 3: Dream Eater (100 power). Only works if Suicune is asleep.
- Item: Ultra Balls (32).
- Backup: GORP (Snorlax) as a tank. Calcifer (Typhlosion) is risky due to type disadvantage.

# Strategic Plan: The West Beach Sprint
- Start Turn: 48151.
- Step 1: Reach East Coast Surf Point and land at (27, 45). (Done)
- Step 2: Walk to (12, 44). (Done)
- Step 3: Navigate to West Beach corridor (X=2) via Row 33 gap (X=9) and Row 35 gap (X=5). (In Progress)
- Step 4: Walk North along X=2 to Row 14.
- Step 5: Walk East along Row 12 to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune sighting.
- Status: XENON leading, Repel active.

# Lessons Learned
- Pathing: The city center is a plateau; the X=9 wall has gaps at Row 33 and Row 44-47. The X=5 wall has gaps at Row 34-37.
- Navigation: Row 51 is a clear corridor but requires going far east to X=20 to descend. Row 33-35 is the most direct land route.
- Blockage: (7, 45) is a Gym Sign (WALL). (5, 44) is a WALL.
