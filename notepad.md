- Apricorn Trees on Route 37: (13, 5) 🔴 Red, (16, 5) 🔵 Blue. Black was harvested earlier.
- Navigation:
  - Route 37 has two lanes separated by trees (x=10-11).
  - Left Lane (x<10): Main Path to Ecruteak (North).
  - Right Lane (x>11): Apricorn Grove (Dead End North).
- **Observation**: Select button swapping failed in Party Menu. Will use 'A' -> 'SWITCH' method.
- **Observation**: `advance_dialogue` caused a loop with Eusine. Using 'B' presses to escape.
- **Hypothesis**: The tile (13, 12) might be a trigger for Eusine's dialogue, causing a loop. Attempting to move UP to break it.
- **Observation**: Row 11 is a rock wall blocking the center (x=5 to x=12). Must use side paths (x=3 or x=13) to proceed North.
- **Plan**: Taking the Left path (x=3) to explore the northern section.
- **Observation**: Access to the top right requires traversing Row 1 (North Corridor) to bypass rock walls at x=6.
- **Hypothesis**: The path to the Rival is Entrance -> Left -> North -> East -> South -> Center.
- **Correction**: Accidentally entered Fight menu. Backing out to switch to Topaz properly.
- **Menu Path**: B (Exit Fight) -> Right (PKMN) -> A -> Down x4 (Topaz) -> A (Switch).
- **Status**: Escaping Burned Tower via West Exit.
- **Location**: (6, 15).
- **Correction**: Row 16 at x=2-5 is `TYPE_3fe2` (Floor). The barrier only spans x=6-11. I can walk out!
- **Action**: Close Menu -> Move Left -> Exit South.
- **Route**: Left to (5, 15) -> South to Exit.
- **Party**: Garnet (27/90). Critical.
- **Goal**: Heal at Pokémon Center.
