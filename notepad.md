# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Strategy: Finding Rock Smash
The northern plateau (14, 10) is blocked by boulders. I need TM08 Rock Smash to proceed. 

### Action Plan
1. Search the northern rock clusters (Row 16-27) for the TM NPC. This is the most likely source.
2. Systematic check of remaining buildings: Pharmacy (15, 47) and Lugia Speech House (15, 37).
3. Teach Rock Smash to GNEISS (Graveler) or GORP (Snorlax).
4. Clear boulders at (8, 16) or (10, 27) and reach Suicune.

## Verified Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way ledge/impassable from the North.
- ROCK: Impassable without Rock Smash.
- Vertical Walls: Major barriers at X=5/6 and X=16-20.

## Battle Plan: Eusine
- Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion) sweep.
- Drowzee/Haunter: Flamethrower.
- Electrode: Thunderpunch or Return.

## Phone Contacts
- Tully, Alan, Arnie, Chad, Dana.
