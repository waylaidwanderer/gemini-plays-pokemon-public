## Saffron City Exploration Plan
- Goal: Map the city and find the path to Cerulean City/Power Plant.
- Step 1: Head north from the Saffron Gate (16, 33) to find the Route 5 exit.
- Step 2: Identify key buildings (Magnet Train Station, Silph Co., Gyms).
- Step 3: Speak with NPCs for clues about the Power Plant.
- Note: Pokefan M at (20, 30) is moving; ignore unless he blocks the path.
- Verified: Saffron Gate is open and traversable.
## Saffron City Observations (Turn 38381)
- Map layout: City seems very large (40x36).
- Current Position: (16, 30).
- Nearby Buildings: Huge building to the north (WALLs from x=12 to x=21, y=26 to y=29). This is likely Silph Co.
- NPCs: Pokefan M at (19, 30).
- Reachable Unseen: Tiles at (11, 30) and (22, 30) suggest the street continues East/West.
- Strategy: Silph Co is blocking direct north movement. I need to go around it to find the Route 5 exit.
- Verified: No dialogue triggered upon entering city.
## Saffron City Exploration Log
- Turn 38383: At (16, 30). Silph Co. building occupies the center of the city.
- Pathfinding to (11, 30) failed, likely due to unseen tiles. Moving manually to (12, 30) to expand visibility.
- NPC Pokefan M is wandering around (18, 30).
