# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH. Allows NORTH. Verified: Down at (12, 49) failed (Turn 49397); Up at (15, 51) worked (Turn 49319).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH. Found at (10, 15).
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
## Strategy: Great Southern Loop (Row 51)
Reach (14, 10) by bypassing land ledges via staggered gaps.
1. Move to (18, 45) and south through gap at (18, 46). <- CURRENT TASK
2. Move to (12, 47) and south through gap at (12, 48).
3. Move to (10, 49) and south through gap at (10, 50).
4. Walk West along Row 51 to X=2 corridor.
5. Walk North along X=2 to Row 12 and East to (14, 10).

## Verified Tile Mechanics
