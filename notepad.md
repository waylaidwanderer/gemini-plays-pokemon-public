### Current Objectives
1. **Find Floria**: Located at Route 36 (North of Route 35).
2. **Get SquirtBottle**: Return to Flower Shop (19, 1) after finding Floria.
3. **Clear Sudowoodo**: Use SquirtBottle on Route 36.

### Navigation Status: Route 35 Gatehouse
- **Current Location**: Map 11_9 (Route 35 Gatehouse).
- **Goal**: Pass through to Route 35 via door at (5, 0).
- **Obstacle**: Party is full.
- **Plan**: Exit North to Route 35 immediately.

### Validated Routes
- **Flower Shop**: CONFIRMED at Goldenrod City (19, 1). Dead end.
- **Floria's Sister's House**: Goldenrod City (29, 5).
- **Underground**: Connects South (11, 29) to North (9, 5).

### Ruled Out Routes
- **West Side (x=6-8)**: Row 5 blocked by walls.
- **Center (x=9-13)**: Row 5 blocked by Underground Entrance and walls.
- **Flower Shop Area (x=18-21)**: Row 4 walls block access to the North-West exits.

### Navigation Plan
- **Current Location**: (19, 8).
- **Hypothesis**: The Route 35 Gatehouse is located in the unexplored North-East corner (x>29, y<5) or North of the Gym.
- **Action**: Move East from (19, 8) past the Gym to x=32, then head North.
- **Goal**: Find the North exit in the top-right sector of the map.

### Quest Log
- **Badges**: Zephyr, Hive, Plain.
- **Party**: Quilava (27), Sentret (2), Bellsprout (6), Togepi (5), Rattata (8), Igglybuff (5).
- **Storage**: Drowzee (Topaz) [Box 1].
- [9590] CONFIRMED: Goldenrod Underground has side exits to enclosed 'Backyards'. The main City entrances/exits are at (11, 29) [South] and (9, 5) [North].
### Ruled Out Routes
- **West Side (Radio Tower)**: Blocked by NPC.
- **Narrow Path (x=3)**: CONFIRMED DEAD END (y=14). Memory was likely about Underground.
- **North-West (Flower Shop)**: Dead end at (19, 1).
- **Underground**: Exits lead to enclosed areas (9, 5) or back to start.
- **Direct North**: Path to (16, 0) is blocked from (19, 11).
- **Row 10 West**: Blocked by Officer at (18, 10).

### Current Plan
- **Explore North-East**: Move North to Row 10, then East past the Gym.
- **Goal**: Reach the area East of the Gym (x>24) and find the exit to Route 35.
- [9794] Map 11_9 is a RESIDENTIAL HOUSE, not the Gatehouse. Contains Randy (gives Kenya quest).
- **Observation**: At (15, 8), facing Name Rater. Main street is to the West.
- **Plan**: Move West to x=10, then head North to find the Gatehouse.
- **Correction**: Previous "Path North" at x=20 led to dead ends. The true exit is likely aligned with the main vertical road (x~9).
- **Observation**: Building at (9, 5) is the Underground Entrance (North).
- **Observation**: Crossing West at y=16 to reach Main Street.
- **Plan**: Move West to x~8, then Head North to find the Route 35 Gatehouse.
- **Note**: Radio Tower is at (5, 15), so aim for x=8 to avoid blockage.
