# Hall of Fame Entry
- **Achievement:** **CHAMPION OF THE JOHTO LEAGUE!**
- **Date:** Turn 33314
- **MVP:** Muscle (Machoke) Lv88.

# Reflection (Turn 35407)
- **Menu Navigation:** Long "macro" sequences (15+ buttons) are unreliable. Split complex actions (e.g., Fly) into discrete steps: 1. Open Map, 2. Navigate, 3. Confirm. Visual verification is mandatory.
- **Tool Development:** Custom tools DO NOT share global scope. Arguments must be explicitly retrieved from `input_data`.
- **Roamer Hunting:** Fly is effective for randomizing positions. Border hopping is unreliable.
- **Shop Inventory:** Shop stock varies by region. If Super Repels aren't found, use standard Repels to save time.

# Roamer Hunt Log
- **Session Start:** Turn 34090.
- **Goal:** Encounter Raikou/Entei on Route 37.
- **Strategy:** Hunt Roamers on Route 38 (Current loc: R38/R42).
- **Party:** Gyarados (Lv36) w/ Repel.
- **Status:** Turn 35455 - In Fly Menu (Violet City). Navigating to Ecruteak to sell items for Repels and resume hunt.

# Lessons Learned
- **Static Roamers:** Border hopping (Route 37 <-> Ecruteak) failed to move Roamers from Routes 38/42 for >100 turns.
- **RNG Reset:** Entering a building (Pokemon Center) did not immediately move them either.
- **Solution:** Using Fly to randomize positions is the next logical step when soft methods fail.
