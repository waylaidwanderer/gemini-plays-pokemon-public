# I. Core Principles
- **Immediate Action is Non-Negotiable:** All documentation, agent creation, and tool refinement must be performed in the current turn.
- **Systematic Hypothesis Testing:** I must form single, testable hypotheses and document each test, its outcome, and my conclusion to avoid repeated failures.
- **Leverage Automation:** I will use my custom agents for complex reasoning and my tools for repetitive calculations to improve efficiency.

## B. Tile Mechanics & Movement Rules
- **ground:** Standard walkable tile.
- **impassable:** Walls, objects, and other barriers. Cannot be entered.
- **warp:** A tile that transports the player to another location.
- **hole:** A warp tile that leads to a lower map area. Typically a one-way trip down.
- **open_gate:** A previously closed gate that is now open and acts as `ground`.
- **closed_gate:** An impassable gate that is currently visible on the screen. Treat as a wall.
- **gate_offscreen:** A gate (either open or closed) that is not currently visible. Treat as potentially open for pathfinding.
- **teleport:** Instant warp tile within the same logical location (e.g., inside a building).
- **spinner_up/down/left/right:** Forces movement in the specified direction.

# III. Pokémon Mansion Puzzle Log & Hypothesis
- **Current State:** I am on Pokemon Mansion B1F. I was previously trapped on 1F because the gates at (21, 18) & (22, 18) closed behind me.
- **Hypothesis (v8):** The two switches in the basement (at (21, 4) and (19, 26)) control the gates on all floors. I have now pressed both. My next step is to return to 1F to observe the new gate configuration and see if a path to the exit is now open.
- **Untested Assumption:** The switches are simple toggles. I need to test if the order of presses matters to confirm this isn't a sequential puzzle.
