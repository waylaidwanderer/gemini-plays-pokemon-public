# Suicune Quest Log (Crystal Version)
- Prerequisites: Clear Bell (Obtained), All Sightings Completed.
- Start: Turn 24182, Saturday 12:45 AM.

## Story Progress
- Team Rocket: Disbanded at Radio Tower.
- Tin Tower: Shook after entering gatehouse with Clear Bell.
- Sages (Gatehouse & 1F): All talked to after tower shook.

## Sighting Progress
1. Burned Tower: Verified.
2. Cianwood City (North): Verified.
3. Route 42 (Central Island): [FAILED] Full sweep of island on Turn 25893 yielded no sighting. Testing east side of route.
4. Route 36 (Sudowoodo Junction): Pending. Checked once.
5. Tin Tower 1F: Pending.

## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable. Standard ground collision.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Traversable with SURF. 
- CUT_TREE: Impassable; remove with CUT. Regrows.
- GRASS / TALL_GRASS: Traversable; triggers encounters.
- CAVE / DOOR / WARP: Transitions.
- LADDER: Vertical transition.
- HEADBUTT_TREE: Impassable.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Traversable (ledges/stairs). Ledges are one-way down.

## Strategy
- Current: Test "Entry Direction" hypothesis. Entered Route 42 from Mahogany. Surf to the island and sweep again.
- Exploration: Explore unseen tiles on the east side of Route 42 (around x=55-59) if the sighting fails.
- Alternative: If the island sweep fails again, I will stop repeating it. My next steps will be: 1. Re-check the Sudowoodo junction on Route 36. 2. Visit the Poké Seer in Cianwood for potential clues. 3. Re-examine the Wise Trio Room in Ecruteak for any missed interactions. 4. Check Tin Tower 1F again.
