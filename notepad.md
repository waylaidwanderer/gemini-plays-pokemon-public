# Key Observations
- Suicune Sighting Sequence: Burned Tower -> Cianwood -> Route 42 -> Route 36 -> Tin Tower.
- Route 37 "WEIRD_TREE" objects at (6, 12) and (7, 12) are the Twins Ann & Anne, not Suicune.
- History of Ecruteak: Two towers were roosts for flying Pokemon. One burned down. Three Pokemon (water, lightning, fire) ran off into the grassland.
- Burned Tower items: Cooltrainer mentioned hidden items in the Burned Tower.

# Items Received
- Fire Stone: Collected from Alan on Route 36 at (31, 14).
- Itemfinder: From Cooltrainer in Ecruteak Itemfinder House (Turn 17417).

# Lessons Learned
## Menu Navigation
- Use 1-2 button presses at a time and verify screen state in complex menus (FLY map, Pokedex).
- Verify "Currently selected" text before committing to navigation tools.

## Suicune Trigger Mechanics
- Pokedex 'Area' tracks the current active overworld sighting location.
- Sightings are triggered by specific tile-entry or movement zones, not object interaction.
