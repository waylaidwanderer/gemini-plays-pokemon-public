# Quest Log
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.

- **Next:** Traverse West Corridor to Red.

# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Location:** Silver Cave Outside.
- **Status:** Searching for West Entrance.
- **Action:** Clear phone call, navigate South to water, Surf West.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Exited cave at (18, 11) (Main Entrance). 
  2. The internal West Corridor (Column 0) was inaccessible from the main area due to ledges. It likely connects to a hidden external entrance.
  3. Row 24 contains water. I will Surf West to search for land and a second cave entrance.
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.

# Tile Mechanics

- **WARP_CARPET:** Step on to exit map.
- **CUT_TREE:** Obstacle unless Cut is used.

- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Walkable from South/Sides. Northbound exit is BLOCKED (Verified at 8,14). Acts as a one-way ledge preventing Northward movement.
