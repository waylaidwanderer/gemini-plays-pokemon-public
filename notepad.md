# Suicune Capture Strategy
## Strategy: The Mean Look Pivot
1. Catch a Gastly in Sprout Tower (Night only, Lv 3-6).
2. Train Gastly to Lv 13 to learn Mean Look.
3. Evolve to Haunter (Lv 25) to ensure Base 95 Speed (Suicune is Base 85).
4. Track Suicune using Pokedex AREA map.
5. Lead with Haunter: Mean Look (Turn 1) -> Hypnosis -> Great Balls.

## Global Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard traversable tile. In Sprout Tower, some FLOOR tiles are "safe" (no encounters).
- TALL_GRASS: Standard encounter tile. Movement registers as steps.
- WALL/HEADBUTT_TREE: Impassable.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT: One-way movement.
- WARP_CARPET_RIGHT/DOWN: Map transition.
- WATER: Traversable with HM SURF.
- ICE: Sliding movement.
- COUNTER: Interaction point for NPCs behind them.
- LADDER: Vertical map transition.
- NPC: Map objects that block movement.

## Sprout Tower 1F Observations
- Sweet Scent failed at (14, 6), (10, 11), and (14, 10). These tiles are "safe".
- (6, 5) on 2F is a valid encounter tile.

## Battle Observations
- Turn #13909: Attempted to status Gastly. Note: Verify if Ghost-types have specific immunities to status moves in this version.
