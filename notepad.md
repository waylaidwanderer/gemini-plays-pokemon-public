# Strategic Notes
## Objectives
- **Primary:** Reach Indigo Plateau (Money Farming Loop).
- **Secondary:** Defeat Elite Four.
- **Tertiary:** Hunt Roamers (Raikou/Entei) - *Paused*.

## Current Task: Traverse Victory Road 1F (South -> East)
- **Location:** Victory Road 1F (West Section) at (1, 49).
- **Goal:** Reach East Section via South Corridor.
- **Route:** `(1, 49) -> (2, 57) -> (7, 57) -> (7, 54) -> (11, 54) -> East`.
- **Reasoning:**
  - Successfully returned to 1F.
  - Heading to southern corridor (Row 57) to bypass potential blockage at (6, 56).
  - Will then navigate East to reach the ladder at (17, 33).

## Status
- **Money:** ¥3294.
- **Party:** Gyarados (Lead), Lugia, Machoke, Pidgey, Oddish, Quilava.
## Reflection (Turn 32967)
- **Execution:** No deferred tasks identified in the last 50 turns.
- **Hygiene:** Notepad sections are relevant. Map markers are active and accurate.
- **Tools:** Current navigation challenges are due to map topology (vertical stacking), not tool deficiency. Standard `navigate` is sufficient with manual warp handling.
- **Goals:** Primary goal (Indigo Plateau) remains valid. Strategy shifted from 2F West (blocked/bugged ledge) to 1F Southeast (exploration).
- **Lesson:** Victory Road (3_91) is a single map with stacked floors. Navigation tools see it as one continuous area but cannot pathfind through warps automatically. I must manually step off and onto ladders to transition between floors.
- **Plan:** Trigger warp at (1, 35) to return to 1F, then traverse the southern corridor to the East section.
