# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Reach the Dragon Shrine via the East Whirlpool.

# Current Status (Turn 18284)
- **Location:** Dragon's Den B1F (24, 22) [Surfing].
- **Facing:** Down (South).
- **Action:** Open Start Menu.
- **Reasoning:** Direct interaction (`A`) failed to trigger Whirlpool prompt. Accessing via Menu is the reliable fallback.
- **Plan:**
  1. Open Start Menu (`Start`).
  2. Verify Cursor Position.
  3. Select POKEMON -> LAPIS -> WHIRLPOOL.

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Requires HM06 Whirlpool + Glacier Badge. Usage: Menu -> Pokemon -> Select Mon -> Whirlpool.
- **Lava/Magma:** (None here, but good to remember).
- **Ice:** (None here).

# Lessons
- **Menu Navigation:** Always verify cursor position before committing to a sequence. Blind input leads to wrong menus (e.g., PACK instead of POKEMON).
