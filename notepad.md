### Current Status
- **Location**: Flower Shop (Goldenrod City).
- **Badge**: Plain Badge (Obtained).
- **Key Items**: Radio Card, Bicycle, Coin Case, Plain Badge.

### Objectives
1. Get SquirtBottle.
2. Go to Route 34 (Daycare).
3. Defeat Sudowoodo (Route 36).

### Tile Mechanics
- TYPE_3fe2: Floor (Walkable)
- TYPE_63e2: Wall/Planter (Blocked)
- TYPE_ffbb: Warp/Door (Walkable)
- TYPE_989e: Door Mat (Likely Blocked/Collision)
- Strategy: Interact with Sudowoodo on Route 36 to 'activate' the need for the SquirtBottle, then return to Goldenrod Flower Shop.
- Issue: Route 35 Gatehouse (Map 11_8) was blocked by a guard.
- Hypothesis: The guard might move now that I have the Plain Badge.
- Plan: Return to Route 35 Gatehouse (29, 5) and attempt to pass. If still blocked, investigate Radio Tower area exits again.
- Dead End: The alley west of the Game Corner (around 6,6) is blocked by walls. Must go south to Radio Tower to access the west side.
