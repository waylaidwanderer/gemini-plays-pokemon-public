## Progress Tracking
- Badges: 7/16 (Johto: 7/8).
- PC: SHUCKIE (Lv15), ROCKY (Lv6), EGG (Lv5), XFDW (Lv16), FRITTATA (Lv5).

# Switch Room Puzzle (Map 3_54)
- Entry: 3_53 (18, 6) Basement Door -> (22, 27) Ladder.
- Layout: Switch 1 (16, 1), Switch 2 (10, 1), Switch 3 (2, 1).
- Observation: Shutters at (12, 2), (13, 2), (18, 2), (19, 2) etc. change state via switches.
