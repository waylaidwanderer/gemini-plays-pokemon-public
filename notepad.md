# Suicune Capture Strategy
- Lead: XENON (Haunter, Lv44).
- Move 1: Hypnosis (Sleep). Accuracy is key.
- Move 2: Night Shade (44 dmg). Suicune (Lv40) has ~120 HP. Use twice for Red health.
- Move 3: Dream Eater (100 power). Only works if Suicune is asleep.
- Item: Ultra Balls (32).
- Backup: GORP (Snorlax) as a tank. Calcifer (Typhlosion) is risky due to type disadvantage.

# Lessons Learned
- Fly Navigation: Johto Fly menu is a linear list scrolled with Up/Down, not a 2D grid.
- Exploration: (11, 15) and (11, 14) are confirmed dead-end pockets.
- Pathing: Cianwood city center is elevated; land routes to the west/north beaches are blocked by FLOOR_UP_WALL and WALL. Surf via the east coast is the primary route.
- Turn 48129: Running from wild Tentacool at Gap 1 (26, 10). Moving to Gap 2 (22, 16).
