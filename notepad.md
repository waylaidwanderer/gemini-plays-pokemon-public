# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Current Status
- **Location**: Cianwood City (22_3).
- **Navigation Strategy**: Enter the building at (17, 41) (Likely Pharmacy).
- **Reflection**: Just exited Pokemon Center. Need SecretPotion.
- **Party**: Garnet (Lvl 40, 64/128 HP), Headache (Surf).
- **Quest**: Obtain Mineral Badge (Jasmine).

### Objectives
- **Primary**: Obtain Mineral Badge (Jasmine).
- **Secondary**: Get SecretPotion (Cianwood).
- **Tertiary**: Train Basil to Lvl 21.

### Notes
- **Cianwood Pharmacy**: Supposed to have the SecretPotion.
- **Gym**: Chuck (Fighting Type). Weak to Psychic/Flying. Requires Strength for boulders (HM04 is in Olivine Café - missed it!). Will need to backtrack to Olivine to get HM04 before challenging Chuck if boulders block the path.
- **Return Trip**: Will need to climb Olivine Lighthouse again.
- **Moomoo Farm**: Needs Berries.
- **Critical Realization**: I missed HM04 (Strength) in Olivine City (Café).
- **Blockage**: Cianwood Gym requires Strength to reach Leader Chuck.
- **Plan**: 
  1. Heal at Pokemon Center.
  2. Find Pharmacy and get SecretPotion.
  3. Buy Repels if possible (General Store?).
  4. Surf back to Olivine City.
  5. Get HM04 Strength.
  6. Deliver Potion to Amphy.
- **Shuckle Guy**: Found at (17, 41) in Cianwood (Map 22_4). Offers a Shuckle to look after.
- **Search Update**: Building at (17, 41) is NOT the Pharmacy. Pharmacy is likely South of the Pokemon Center.
- **Discovery**: Found a previously unnoticed door at (15, 37) in Cianwood.
- **Hypothesis**: This is likely the Pharmacy.
- **Plan**: Navigate to (15, 38) and enter.
