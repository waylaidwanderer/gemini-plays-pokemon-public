# Ice Path Strategy
- **Current Action:** Accessing North-West Passage.
- **Hypothesis:** The corridor at x=0 connects the South Hub to the North Ice Area.
- **Route:**
  1. Walk West to (0, 16).
  2. Walk North along x=0 to (0, 0) [or as far as possible].
  3. Look for entrances East into the ice fields.
  
- **Goal:** Reach Ladder to B1F (Likely in NE).

# Map Structure
- **West Edge (x=0):** Open floor corridor N-S.
- **Hub (y=16):** Connects to West Edge.
- **North Ice Fields:** Separated from West Edge by Wall at x=1. Check for gaps.
- **South Loop:** SE Floor (Row 23) leads to Exit Ledge (29, 11).

# Items
- **Item Ball at (32, 23):** Access via East Ice Puzzle.
- **Item Ball at (35, 9):** Access via NE area.
