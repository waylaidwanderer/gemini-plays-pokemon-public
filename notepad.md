- FLOOR: Standard ground. Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Surf required. Traversable.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- DOOR: Warp point.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable cliff face (e.g., Row 15, Row 30, Row 34).

# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Plan:
  1. Walk to (19, 30). [DONE]
  2. Surf at (19, 30) -> (20, 30). [IN PROGRESS]
  3. Navigate to (23, 15) via the main channel.
  4. Navigate to (18, 14) via Gap 4.
  5. Navigate to (16, 11) and land.
  6. Walk to (14, 10).
- Reasoning: Row 15 is a continuous wall of cliffs and buoys from X=6 to X=22. The only gap is at (23, 15). Once past it, Row 14 and Row 11 provide a path to the northern plateau landing spot.
