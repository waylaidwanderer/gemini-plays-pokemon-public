# Reflection (Turn 24561)
- **Execution:** Addressed unmarked warps at (17, 7) and (18, 7) leading to Route 22.
- **Hygiene:** Notepad organized. Removed redundant "Black Belt" obstacle note for East path.
- **Map:** Marking warps at (17, 7) and (18, 7).
- **Lessons:** Gatehouse layout is crucial. Row 17 = South (Route 26). Row 7 (East side) = East (Route 22). Always verify compass direction.
- **Unseen Tiles:** Tile at (3, 5) is West, likely blocked by other Black Belt or Route 28 Guard. Ignoring for now to focus on Viridian.
