# Strategy for Primary Goal (Defeat Gym Leader Chuck)
- Observation: Poliwrath (Lv30) is very strong. Its DynamicPunch is devastating. -2 Accuracy (from Smokescreen) helped but wasn't enough for a Lv10/Lv34 team.
- Plan: Train KIMCHI (Oddish) to Lv21+ to evolve into Gloom. Deliver SecretPotion to Jasmine first to gain levels/money along the way.
- Rematch Criteria: KIMCHI at Lv25+, Calcifer at Lv36+.

# Strategy for Training & Medicine Delivery
- Training Route: Surf Route 41 -> Route 40.
- Strategy: Return to Olivine City. Enter the Lighthouse. Take the stairs/elevator to 6F. Talk to Jasmine at (8, 8) to deliver the medicine to Amphy.
