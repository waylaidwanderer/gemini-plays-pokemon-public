## I. Game & Tile Mechanics

### Tile Traversal Rules (Verified)
- **Impassable:** WALL, VOID, CUT_TREE, WATER, HEADBUTT_TREE, PC, COUNTER, PILLAR, BOOKSHELF, TV, RADIO, TOWN_MAP, WINDOW, SUPER_NERD (NPC), FISHER (NPC), LASS (NPC), TEACHER (NPC), YOUNGSTER (NPC), OFFICER (NPC), STATUE, TABLE, CHAIR, BED, TWIN (NPC), GYM_GUIDE (NPC), BUG_CATCHER (NPC)
- **Traversable:** FLOOR, GRASS, TALL_GRASS (Wild Encounters)
- **Standard Warps:** DOOR, CAVE, LADDER (Acts as a two-way vertical warp)
- **Directional Warps:** WARP_CARPET_LEFT, WARP_CARPET_RIGHT, WARP_CARPET_DOWN (Must press the indicated direction *while standing on the tile* to activate).
- **One-Way Ledges:** LEDGE_HOP_DOWN, LEDGE_HOP_LEFT, LEDGE_HOP_RIGHT (One-way traversal in the specified direction).
- **Complex One-Way Tiles:** FLOOR_UP_WALL (Can only be entered by moving UP. Once on it, you can only exit by moving LEFT or RIGHT. You cannot move UP or DOWN off of it).

### Untested Tile Mechanics
- **LEDGE:** Test if this is impassable from all directions.
- **FLOOR_ALLOW_HOP_DOWN:** Test if this tile only allows downward movement.

## II. Quest Progression & Puzzles

### Blocked Path: Ilex Forest West
- **Objective:** Clear the CUT tree at (8, 25) to access the western part of the forest.
- **Prerequisite:** Obtain HM01 (CUT).

### Ruins of Alph Puzzle
- **Objective:** Solve the sliding stone panel puzzle.
- **Current Hypothesis:** The solution is not in the first chamber. The ladder at (10, 13) is the only other path forward.

### Azalea Gym Puzzle
- **Objective:** Reach and defeat Gym Leader Bugsy.
- **Critical Insight:** The path is blocked by trainers at (4, 10) and (5, 10), so something must move the platforms. The wall 'switches' are not real objects. The statues at (3, 13) and (6, 13) are the only other interactable candidates.
- **Current Plan:** Test the left statue at (3, 13).
- **Failed Attempts Log:**
  - H1: Simple switch combinations (L:ON/R:OFF, L:OFF/R:ON, L:ON/R:ON) on the wall decorations failed.
  - H2: Toggle sequences on the wall decorations failed.
  - H3: Attempting to 'ride' the platforms by standing on the tracks failed.
  - H4: Attempting to interact with the platforms directly failed.
  - H5: Interacting with the right statue at (6, 13) from (5, 13) did nothing.

## III. Item Effects
- **EVERSTONE:** A Pokémon holding this item will not evolve.
- **BERRY:** Restores 10 HP. Obtained from FRUIT_TREEs.

## IV. Procedural Reminders
- **IMMEDIATE DATA MANAGEMENT:** Update Notepad, Markers, and WKG IMMEDIATELY after discovering new information. No exceptions.
- **TRUST THE AGENTS:** Use agents proactively for complex problems. Trust their outputs, especially when stuck. Refine them if they are flawed.
