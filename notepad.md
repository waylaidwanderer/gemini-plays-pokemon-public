- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Current Task
- **Mechanic**: Stepping on (7, 15) transitions between Map 3_14 (Upper) and Map 3_13 (Lower/Hole State).
- **Goal**: Find the B1F drop on Map 3_13.

### Notes
- **Map 3_14**: Burned Tower 1F (Center).
- **Goal**: Interact with Silver at (10, 4) to clear the path.
- **Status**: Garnet recovered. Ready for potential rival battle.

- **Map 3_13**: Tile (15, 4) is a BREAKABLE ROCK (impassable), despite being TYPE_3fe2. BFS will fail here. Go around via the Left side (Col 4).
- **Map 3_13**: Item at (14, 2) is blocked by Breakable Rock at (15, 4). Requires Rock Smash.
- **Exploration**: Checking bottom-right area (Cols 14-16) before leaving.
