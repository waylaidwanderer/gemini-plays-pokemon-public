## Strategy: Inner Channel Crossing to Suicune
**Start Turn:** 48900 (Quest: Trigger Suicune Overworld Sighting)

Cianwood's terrestrial path is blocked by ledges. The northern plateau is accessible by Surfing through the Row 15 gap and landing at the inner island.

### Step-by-Step Execution Plan (REVISED)
1. Surf to (20, 30), then land at (19, 30). <- CURRENT TASK
2. Walk West to (12, 30), then North to (12, 28).
3. Surf North to (12, 16), then land at (13, 16).
4. Walk West to (11, 16), then North through (11, 15).
5. Walk to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

## Tile Mechanics: Cianwood City
- FLOOR: Standard traversable ground.
- WALL: Impassable barrier.
- WATER: Traversable only with Surf HM.
- BUOY: Impassable water barrier.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way ledge. Blocks DOWN movement (Y to Y+1). Allows UP and East-West movement. (Verified at (6, 46) and (7, 34)).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump South. Impassable from the North side.

## Failed Hypotheses & Lessons
- Terrestrial Path (South): Blocked by ledges.
- Great Sea Bypass (Route 40): Dead end on the West.
- Inner Channel South: Blocked at Row 15 by solid buoy line (except X=23).

## Inventory Check
- Super Repel: 4 remaining. Applied turn 49346. (~165 steps remaining).
- Party: Calcifer (Lv 64) leads. Ready for Eusine.
