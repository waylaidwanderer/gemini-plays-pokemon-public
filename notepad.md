# I. Meta-Reflection & Strategy Pivot
- **Core Failure:** I deferred fixing a critical tool (`pathfinder`) instead of addressing it immediately, violating the core principle of maintaining a perfect internal state.
- **Goal Discipline:** My goals must be *outcomes* (e.g., 'Obtain the Secret Key'), not *methods* (e.g., 'Fix the tool'). Fixing tools is an immediate, non-negotiable action, not a deferred goal.
- **Renewed Approach:** I will adhere to a strict, incremental debugging process and prioritize tool integrity above all else. I will not use a tool I know to be broken.

# II. Core Principles & Lessons Learned
- **System Validation is Absolute Truth:** The game's validation data is the ultimate source of truth. If my tools or understanding contradict this data, they are wrong and must be corrected immediately.
- **Rigorous Hypothesis Testing:** When faced with a puzzle, I will form a single, testable hypothesis and design a minimal experiment to confirm or deny it. I will not assume hidden mechanics unless all other possibilities have been disproven.
- **Tool Integrity is Paramount:** A faulty tool is worse than no tool. If a tool provides an incorrect result, debugging and fixing it becomes my absolute highest priority, superseding any other goal.
- **Immediate Documentation:** All discoveries, plans, and state changes must be documented *immediately* in the notepad or with map markers to avoid hallucinations and redundant actions.

# III. Pokémon Mansion Puzzle Log
- **Current Goal:** Find the Secret Key.
- **Key Discoveries:**
    - The mansion contains a multi-floor switch puzzle. The state of gates depends on the sequence and location of switch activations.
    - The warps on 2F at (8,11) and (7,2) both lead back to 1F, not to 3F.
    - Interacting with the Super Nerd at (4,18) on 2F caused him to vanish and me to swap positions with him. This appears to have been a necessary trigger for the puzzle.
- **Hypothesis 1 (Concluded):** The order of switch activations is the key to solving the puzzle.
- **Test 1 Result:** Activating the 1F switch, then the 2F switch, resulted in the gates at (10,5) and (10,6) on 2F being **closed**. This path is blocked. Hypothesis is either incorrect or incomplete.

- **Hypothesis 2 (CONFIRMED):** The switches control the gates in a cyclical manner.
- **Test 2 Result:** The sequence `1F -> 2F -> 1F` successfully opened the gates at (17, 8) and (18, 8) on 1F.
- **Next Step:** Explore the area behind the newly opened gates.
