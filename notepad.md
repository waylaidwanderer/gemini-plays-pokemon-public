# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement. Passable from SOUTH to NORTH.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at Row 15 (X=3-17).
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
## Strategy: The X=2 Highway (Final)
Reach (14, 10) by navigating to the far western corridor to bypass all ledges.
1. Surf West at Row 26 to (17, 26) (Gap in X=18 wall).
2. Surf North to (17, 24) and West to (12, 24).
3. Land at (12, 28) or (12, 33).
4. Move West along Row 33 to (6, 33) (Crossing X=11, 9, 7 gaps).
5. Move West through Row 34 gap at (5, 34) to (4, 34).
6. Move South to (4, 35) and West to (2, 35) (Crossing X=3 gap at 3, 35).
7. Move North along X=2 corridor to (2, 12) (Bypasses Row 15 ledge).
8. Move East along Row 12 to (14, 12) and North to (14, 10).

# Progress Notes
- Verified: Row 26 is a clear sea path from X=24 to X=17.
- Verified: X=2 corridor is clear from Row 35 to Row 12 (No ledge at Row 15).
- Verified: Row 12 is a clear horizontal highway from X=2 to X=16.
- SUPER REPEL is active (Turn 49722).
- Stagnation Check: Abandoning all other routes; X=2 Highway is the priority.
