# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard ground. Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Surf required. Traversable.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- DOOR: Warp point.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable cliff face (e.g., Row 15, Row 30, Row 34).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
- BREAKABLE ROCK: Requires Rock Smash. Impassable.
- NPC: Impassable. Interact from adjacent tile.

# Blocked Routes (Verified)
- Central City Maze: Blocked at X=9 (Rows 34-37) and X=5 (Rows 30-33).
- Row 30 Cliff: Impassable from X=4 to X=11.
- Buoy Maze: Impassable walls at X=26, X=22, and X=19.

# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The Great Western Highway
- Plan:
  1. Use Super Repel. [DONE]
  2. Surf at (20, 30) and go to (23, 30). [IN PROGRESS]
  3. Land at (23, 32) and walk to (2, 44).
  4. Walk North along the west beach (X=2) to (2, 12).
  5. Walk East to (14, 12) then North to (14, 10).
- Status: At (19, 30) on land.
- Reasoning: Bypasses the central city maze and the buoy labyrinth by using the southern city corridor (Row 44) to access the open west beach highway.
