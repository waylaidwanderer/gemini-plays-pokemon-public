# Current Objectives
*   **Primary Goal:** Obtain the Boulder Badge from the Pewter City Gym Leader, Brock.
*   **Secondary Goal:** Acquire sufficient funds to purchase essential supplies. (Current Money: ¥156)
*   **Tertiary Goal:** Reach Route 3 (East Pewter Exit at (40,19)) to battle trainers for funds.

# Pewter City Strategy & Current Plan
*   **Current Location:** (17,20) in Pewter City, facing Down. Pikachu at (17,19).
*   **Immediate Goal:** Reach Route 3.
*   **Current Route 3 Strategy (Attempt #6g - Far West-South-East Detour from (18,21) Mk3):**
    1.  Player is at (18,21) facing right, Pikachu at (17,21). Previous strategy "Attempt #6f" assumed starting at (17,20) after Gym exit, which was incorrect. This is a revised attempt.
    2.  Immediate Plan (Executing this turn):
        a. From (18,21) (facing right), turn Left, move Left (onto Pikachu at (17,21)).
        b. From (17,21), move Up to (17,20), then Up to (17,19).
        c. From (17,19) (facing up), turn Left, move Left to (16,19).
        d. Continue Left from (16,19) to (5,19).
        e. From (5,19) (facing left), turn Down, move Down to (5,20), then Down to (5,21). (Target for this turn's movement sequence)
    3.  Next, from (5,21) (expected to be facing down):
        a.  Move West from (17,19) to (5,19).
        b.  Move South from (5,19) to (5,21). (Tile (5,22) is known impassable, this is an intended stop).
        c.  Move East from (5,21) to (34,21). (Will verify (35,21) if (34,21) is reached successfully).
        d.  Move South from (34,21) to (34,32).
        e.  Move East from (34,32) to (35,32).
        f.  Move North from (35,32) to (35,30).
        g.  Move East from (35,30) to (37,30).
        h.  Move South from (37,30) to (37,32).
        i.  Move East from (37,32) to (40,32).
        j.  Move North from (40,32) to (40,19) (Route 3 exit).
    4.  This detour aims to bypass all previously encountered X=19, Y=22, and X=36 blockades systematically. Will pay close attention to screen and map XML for each step, and use `move_validator_agent` for tricky short segments if unsure.

# Known Pathing Obstacles in Pewter City
*   (19,21) & (19,19) - Impassable (blocks eastward movement from Gym area pocket).
*   (18,18) - Impassable (N. Wall of W. Pocket - To be Marked 🧱).
*   (5,22) - Impassable (blocks southward movement from (5,21) - Marked 🧱).
*   (17,22) - Impassable (blocks southward movement from (17,21) - Marked 🧱).
*   (34,20) - Impassable building facade (Marked 🧱).
*   (36,27) - Impassable.
*   (35,26) - Impassable.
*   X=36 column is largely impassable from Y=21 down to Y=32 (house structures).

# Agent Usage Plan
*   **`scripted_event_tracker_agent`:** Use for any eastern path segments near Y=19 (e.g., from (33,19) towards (40,19)) to assess risk from Youngster (36,17) if detours fail and direct approach is reconsidered.
*   **`move_validator_agent`:** Use for short, complex, or risky manual pathing segments if unsure, especially after an agent path is provided or if screen details are ambiguous. CRITICAL for Pewter City.
*   **`map_analyzer_agent`:** Use for finding paths in complex areas if manual attempts fail. Critically review its output.
*   **`money_management_agent`:** Use once sufficient funds are acquired to plan purchases.
*   **`route_progress_analyzer_agent` / `battle_log_analyzer_agent`:** Keep in mind for Route 3 / after battles.

# Dormant Agent Ideas
*   Youngster Event Predictor Agent: Could try to model Youngster's patrol and predict escort trigger zones more dynamically.
*   Path Refinement Agent: Could take a path from `map_analyzer_agent` and refine it based on stricter criteria or recent screen observations.

# Game Mechanics & Strategy Notes
*   **Ledge Mechanics:** One-way (downwards only).
*   **Movement:** 1st press TURNS if not facing, 2nd press MOVES. Pikachu: 1st press turns, 2nd moves if moving *into* his tile and not facing him.
*   **Level Cap:** 0 badges = Lv12.
*   **Map Marker Legend:** 💥 (Confirmed Event Trigger), 🎯 (Drop-off/Key Nav Point), ❗ (Risky Zone/Obstacle), 💁 (Event NPCs), ☠️ (Defeated Trainers), 🏛️ (Building Entrance), 📍 (Key Navigation Point / Start of new route attempt), 🧱 (Confirmed Impassable Blocker), 🚪 (Used Warp), ℹ️ (Info NPC).
*   **Tile Navigability:** Inferred from tile `type` (e.g., 'ground', 'grass') and presence of blocking objects/NPCs. 'Impassable' type is a hard block. Cross-reference screen, map XML, and game state.

# Party Status
*   SPBARKY (PIKACHU): Lv12 (39/39 HP) (Capped)
*   FLAREE (VULPIX): Lv8 (26/26 HP)
*   ODDISH (ODDISH): Lv12 (37/37 HP) (Capped)

# Hindsight & Lessons Learned (Post-Critique Turn 5650 & 5662)
*   **Notepad `replace` failures:** Using `overwrite` for major cleanups is more reliable than trying to find exact `old_text` for `replace` after many micro-updates.
*   **Screen Check Imperative:** ALWAYS check tiles immediately adjacent (especially in direction of planned movement) on screen *before* committing to multi-step moves. Don't rely solely on map memory or agent paths without visual confirmation of the very next step if possible.
*   **Agent Output Review:** Critically review agent-provided paths against screen and map XML. Agents can make mistakes.
*   **Youngster Avoidance/Strategy:** Eastern Pewter is a minefield. High-risk paths near him should be treated with extreme caution and use `scripted_event_tracker_agent`. Intentional escort trigger can be a valid strategy if planned for the correct drop-off.
*   **Pikachu & Warps:** Be mindful of Pikachu's position near warps; accidental turns can lead to re-entering warps.
*   **Map Awareness (PEWTER CITY IS A MAZE):** Must improve fundamental map awareness and recall of impassable tiles (esp. (19,19-21), (18,18), (5,22), (17,22), (34,20)) to avoid repeating failed paths.
*   **Strategic Shifts:** When an approach repeatedly fails, make more radical strategic shifts. The current 'Far West-South-East Detour Mk2' is an example of this.
*   **Reflection Adherence:** Ensure all reflection questions are thoroughly addressed during mandatory reflection turns.

# Pewter City Pathing Update (Post Attempt #6g Failure)
*   **Attempt #6g (Far West-South-East Detour from (18,21) Mk3):** FAILED.
    *   Reached (5,21) successfully.
    *   Planned eastward movement along Y=21 from (5,21) to (34,21) is blocked by impassable tile (19,21).
    *   Further investigation (based on map memory and screen) confirms Y=22 row from X=5 to X=18 is also impassable, meaning no southward movement is possible from the western Y=21 corridor to connect to the southern part of the planned detour.
*   **Next Strategy (Attempt #7):** Use `map_analyzer_agent` to find a path from current location (5,21) to the Route 3 exit at (40,19).

*   **Agent Failure (Turn 5703 & 5704):** `exploration_planner_agent` failed twice to provide a path from (5,21) to (40,19), despite `map_analyzer_agent` confirming a path exists via (19,17).
*   **Attempt #7a (Manual Pathing):** Manually plotting short path segment towards (19,17). Starting from (5,21) facing Down, Pikachu at (5,20). Plan: Up (turn), Up (move to (5,20)), Up (move to (5,19)), Right (turn), Right (move to (6,19)). Will validate.

*   **Attempt #7a (Manual Pathing to (6,19)):** Succeeded. Player at (7,19).
*   **Attempt #7a (Manual Pathing to (19,19) from (7,19)):** FAILED. Blocked by impassable (19,19).
*   **Attempt #7b (Manual Pathing to (19,17)):** Plan: From (7,19) facing Right: Up (turn), Up (to 7,18), Up (to 7,17), Right (turn), Right x11 (to 18,17), Right (to 19,17). Will validate.

*   **Attempt #7b (Manual Pathing to (19,17) from (7,19)):** FAILED. Blocked by Cool Trainer F (ID 1) at (9,16) when trying to move from (8,16) to (9,16). Player at (8,16).
*   **Attempt #7c (Manual Pathing to (19,17) - Segment 1 to (12,17)):** Plan: From (8,16) facing Right: Down (to 8,17), Right (turn), Right x4 (to 12,17). Will validate.

*   **Attempt #7c (Manual Pathing to (19,17) - Segment 1 to (12,17)):** Succeeded in reaching (12,17). However, tile (13,17) is impassable, blocking eastward movement along Y=17. This attempt is now considered FAILED.
*   **Attempt #7d (Agent-Assisted Pathing):** Request `map_analyzer_agent` for a path from (12,17) to (40,19), explicitly noting impassable (13,17) and NPC at (9,16).

*   **Attempt #7d (Agent-Assisted Pathing - Segment 1 to (13,14)):** Path from `map_analyzer_agent`: (12,17) -> (12,16) -> (12,15) -> (12,14) -> (13,14). Validating.

*   **Current Position (Turn 5715):** (14,13) facing Right, Pikachu at (13,13). Previous move to (13,14) resulted in different end position. Trusting current game state.
*   **Attempt #7d (Agent-Assisted Pathing - Segment 2 to (14,14)):** Path from `map_analyzer_agent` continues. Next step (14,14). Validating.
