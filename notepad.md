# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement (acting as a ledge). Passable from SOUTH to NORTH.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at Row 15 (X=3-17).
- ROCK: Smashable rocks act as WALLs.
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
## Strategy: The Internal Bypass (Row 35)
Reach (14, 10) by navigating internal corridors via specific wall gaps.
1. Land at (23, 33).
2. Move West to (10, 33). (Detour Pokefan at 17, 33).
3. Move South to (10, 35).
4. Move West to (4, 35) via gap at (5, 35).
5. Move North to (4, 33).
6. Move West to (2, 33).
7. Move North to (2, 12) (bypasses Row 15 ledge).
8. Move East to (14, 12) and North to (14, 10).

# Progress Notes
- Blocked: Row 34 ledge (X=6-8) blocks SOUTH movement from Row 33.
- Blocked: (4, 25) is a smashable rock (acts as WALL).
- Blocked: X=12 corridor blocked by WATER at Row 27.
- Verified: Row 35 gap at (5, 35) allows crossing X=5 wall.
- Verified: Row 22 gap at (3, 22) allows crossing X=3 wall.
- Verified: X=4 corridor is clear from Row 35 to Row 33.
- Verified: X=2 corridor is clear from Row 33 to Row 12.
- Verified: Row 12 is a clear horizontal path from X=2 to X=14.
