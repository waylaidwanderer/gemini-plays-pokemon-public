# Legendary Roamer Hunt
- **Strategy**: Blind Encounter. Pace in Route 37 grass with Repel Trick to force a first roamer sighting.

- Roamers: Do NOT appear on Pokegear map until first encounter. Red dots on map are NOT roamers.
- Menu Navigation: Cursor memory is persistent. Split deep navigation into chunks < 50 buttons.
- Fly: Outdoors only.
- Repel Step Counting: Reset count when Repel wears off.
- Tool Interruptions: Repel messages and phone calls interrupt tools like `grass_pacer`. Clear text before resuming.
