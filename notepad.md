# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Deliver Kenya to Route 31.
- **Secondary Goal:** Travel to Mahogany Town (Route 42).
- **Tertiary Goal:** Train Party to Level 30+.
- **Current Action:** Take Mail from Kenya.
  1. **State:** Hematite's menu open.
  2. **Action:** Close menu (B), Scroll to Kenya (Down x4), Open Menu (A).
  3. **Next:** Select MAIL -> TAKE.
  4. **Then:** Go to Pack -> Items -> Flower Mail -> Give -> Kenya -> Write "DARK CAVE leads to another road".
  5. **Status:** Kenya equipped with Flower Mail ("HI"). Needs correction.

## Reflection (Turn 8837)
- **Immediate:** Addressing Mail Message fix.
- **Hygiene:** Marked "Wrong Recipient" on Fisher. Need to mark Cooltrainer status.
- **Analysis:** "HI" message likely broke the quest trigger. In Gen 2, Mail content is often just data, but specific delivery quests might check flags or require the *original* item state. Restoring the message is the best attempt to "reset" the item state.
- **Error:** Assumed any mail on Kenya would work.
- **Lesson:** Do not alter quest items unless necessary.

## Party Status
- **Team:** Muscle (41), Garnet (28), Hematite (15), Azurite (13), Lapis (12), Mistral (13), Kenya (10).
- **Inventory:** Contains FLOWER MAIL (3 in Bag).

## Quests
- **Webster's Mail:** Delivering Kenya (Spearow) to Route 31. Recipient is likely the Cooltrainer near Dark Cave.

## Mechanics Notes
- **Fly Map:** List-based `Up`/`Down`. New Bark -> Cherrygrove -> Violet -> Azalea -> Goldenrod.
- **Menu Cursor:** Always verify position.
