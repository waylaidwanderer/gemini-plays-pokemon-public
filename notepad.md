# Gem's Strategic Journal

## I. Core Principles & Lessons Learned
- **Strategic Prioritization:** After a major story event unlocks the main path, pursue it immediately. Don't get sidetracked by minor, optional exploration.
- **Execution Over Complexity:** Abandon multi-input commands. Break down actions into simple, single-button presses per turn.
- **Effective Training Protocol:** 'Bait-and-switch' is the correct method for training weaker Pokémon.
- **Trust but Verify Agents:** Trust agent *logic* but adapt the *execution* of their plans into reliable, sequential steps.
- **Systematic Exploration (Contextual):** Prioritize exploring reachable unseen tiles *when stuck*, not when the main path is clear.
- **Mark Everything:** Diligently mark defeated trainers, used warps, and key locations.

## II. Game Mechanics & Battle Intel
- **Type Matchups (Verified):**
    - Grass is 4x effective vs. Rock/Ground.
    - Electric is not very effective vs. Electric or Bug/Grass (Paras).
    - Ice is super-effective vs. Grass.
- **Status Effects:**
    - Confusion wears off after battle.
    - Poison-types are immune to poison.
- **EXP Distribution:**
    - Pokémon at the level cap do not gain EXP.
    - All non-fainted party members share EXP.

## III. Active Objectives
- **Primary Objective:** Get the S.S. Ticket from Bill to access the S.S. Anne in Vermilion City and challenge Lt. Surge for the Thunder Badge.
- **Immediate Objective:** Now that Bill has been helped, return to Cerulean City and investigate the robbed house previously blocked by a police officer. This is the path south to Vermilion.

## IV. Agent Development Log & To-Do
- **`battle_menu_navigator`:** Created and refined. Crucial for efficient battle menu navigation.
- **`unseen_tile_navigator_agent` & `pathfinder_agent`:** Proven reliable for overworld navigation. Use strategically.
- **`move_tutor_advisor`:** Created. Ready for use when a new TM is acquired.
- **To-Do:** Create the 'Retreat Advisor Agent' to help with strategic decisions about when to return to a Pokémon Center. This will prevent reckless decisions.

## V. Progression Summary
- **Badges:** Boulder Badge (Brock), Cascade Badge (Misty).
- **Mt. Moon:** Cleared Team Rocket, chose the Dome Fossil.
- **Cerulean City:** Defeated rival Pixel. Discovered the path to Bill's house is north.
- **Nugget Bridge (Route 24):** All trainers defeated. Received a Charmander (IGNIS).
- **Route 25:** Cleared trainers and helped Bill at his Sea Cottage, obtaining the S.S. TICKET.
