# Strategy: The Suicune Pursuit
- **Time Check:** Attempting sighting since Turn #50620.
- **Objective:** Trigger Suicune sighting at (14, 10) in northern Cianwood.
- **Eusine Battle Prep:** Lead with Lv64 Calcifer.
- **Current Plan (The Grand Loop):**
  1. Currently at (27, 45). Surf at (28, 45).
  2. Surf East to X=30, then South to Row 51.
  3. Surf West to (24, 51) and land.
  4. Walk West on Row 51 to (2, 51).
  5. Walk North via X=2 corridor to (2, 10), then East to (14, 10).
- **Verification:** X=2 corridor confirmed clear. Eastern water bypasses Row 46-50 Terrace Climbs.

# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Standard traversable terrain.
- WALL: Impassable terrain.
- BUOY: Impassable terrain (Blocks both Surf and Walk).
- WATER: Traversable only with Surf.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump DOWN (South). Blocks North movement.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL (Terrace Climb): One-way jump UP (North). Blocks South movement.
- ROCK (Object): Blocks movement; cleared with Rock Smash.
