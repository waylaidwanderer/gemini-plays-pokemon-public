# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Reach the Dragon Shrine via the East Whirlpool.

# Current Status (Turn 18288)
- **Location:** Dragon's Den B1F (24, 22).
- **Facing:** Up (CRITICAL ERROR FOUND).
- **Menu State:** "Switch" Mode (Party Menu).
- **Action:** Fix Facing and Interact.
- **Reasoning:** Game State shows `Facing: Up`. Whirlpool is Down. This explains why `WHIRLPOOL` was missing from the menu.
- **Plan:**
  1. Exit all menus (`B` x4).
  2. Face Down (`Down`).
  3. Interact (`A`).

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Requires HM06 Whirlpool + Glacier Badge. Usage: Menu -> Pokemon -> Select Mon -> Whirlpool.
- **Lava/Magma:** (None here, but good to remember).
- **Ice:** (None here).

# Lessons
- **Menu Navigation:** Always verify cursor position before committing to a sequence. Blind input leads to wrong menus (e.g., PACK instead of POKEMON).
