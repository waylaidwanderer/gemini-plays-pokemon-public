# Johto Elite Four Challenge
- Challenge Start: Turn 37260. [Friday 11:58 AM]

## Strategy for Lance (Champion)
- Gyarados: DEFEATED
- Aerodactyl: DEFEATED
- Dragonite #1: DEFEATED
- Dragonite #2: DEFEATED
- Charizard (Fire/Flying): ACTIVE. Strategy: GNEISS (4x Rock advantage) or Calcifer (Thunderpunch).
- Dragonite #3 (Dragon/Flying): UPCOMING. Strategy: XENON (Hypnosis/Confuse Ray) if revived.

## Persistence Knowledge
### Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- LADDER: Traversable.
- WARP_CARPET: Walking off map edge triggers transition.

### Lessons Learned
- Gengar (Ghost): Immune to Normal moves (Return).
- Dragonite/Charizard (Ghost interaction): XENON is immune to Normal moves (Hyper Beam/Slash).
- Party Sub-menu Order (Battle): SWITCH, STATS, CANCEL.
- Party Sub-menu Order (Overworld): STATS, SWITCH, ITEM, CANCEL.
- HM Sub-menu logic: HM moves appear at top. SWITCH is 3rd if 1 HM known.
- Status Management: Level advantage is negated by paralysis (75% speed reduction). Priority is clearing status for the speed tier.

## Battle Strategy
- Use fodder to safely Revive key members (XENON, GNEISS).
- Strategy Update: Calcifer is paralyzed and low HP. Plan is to let him faint, then use a Revive to restore him to 50% HP and clear status. This is more efficient than using multiple turns to heal him with berries.
- XENON uses Hypnosis to disable threats.
- GNEISS (Rollout) is the backup for Charizard if XENON fails.
- Goal: Secure a knockout on Charizard with GNEISS or Calcifer.
## Final Push Strategy
- Goal: Restore Calcifer's speed by clearing paralysis via faint/revive.
- Step 1: Send in Calcifer (31 HP, PAR).
- Step 2: Calcifer faints to Charizard.
- Step 3: Send in GNEISS (35 HP). GNEISS resists Fire.
- Step 4: GNEISS uses REVIVE on Calcifer.
- Step 5: Calcifer returns at 50% HP (89 HP) with no paralysis.
- Step 6: Calcifer outspeeds and sweeps with Thunderpunch/Return.
