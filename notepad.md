# Goldenrod Underground Switch Puzzle

## Current Status
- **Location:** Switch Room (3_54), Central Area.
- **Objective:** Explore Inner East Section.
- **Goal:** Rescue Director / Find Warehouse.

## Switch Logic (Confirmed)
- **S1 (16, 1):** East/West Toggle.
    - **ON:** Opens East Gate `(12, 8)`. Closes West Gate `(6, 8)`.
    - **OFF:** Opens West Gate `(6, 8)`. Closes East Gate `(12, 8)`.
    - **Current State:** OFF. West Gate `(6, 8)` is OPEN. (Verified Turn 14797).
- **S2 (10, 1):** Main Power.
    - **ON:** Required for gates to operate. (Currently ON).
- **S3 (2, 1):** Emergency Override.
    - **OFF:** (Currently OFF).
- **Shutters:** `(17, 6)` and `(20, 6)` remain CLOSED with S1=ON/S2=ON/S3=OFF.

## Lessons Learned
- **Tool Logic:** `autopress_buttons` requires the tool to output a JSON list of strings.
- **Navigation:** `path_plan` MUST include the current position as the first element. Omitting it causes misalignment.

## Plan
1. Navigate to `(12, 13)` (South of Target Shutter).
   - Current Position: `(12, 5)`.
2. Move West from `(12, 13)` to explore the unseen area at Row 14 `(9-11, 14)`.
   - The map indicates a corridor heading West.
3. Locate the Director or the Warehouse entrance.

## Observations
- **Switch Status:** S1=OFF, S2=ON, S3=ON.
- **Area Status:**
  - `(12, 12)` Target Shutter is OPEN.
  - `(12, 13)` leads to a T-junction or room.
  - West path leads to unseen tiles.
- **Goal:** Explore the new area thoroughly.

## Reflection (Turn 14911)
- **Tool Maintenance:** Deleted `find_path` as it was broken and returning empty lists. Will rely on manual navigation or build a better pathfinder later if needed.
- **Current Situation:** Accessed the area behind the East Gate at `(13, 8)`. It appears to be a small room `(13,8)-(17,9)` separated from the south by walls. Need to check for hidden switches or items.
- **Puzzle:** The warp at `(22, 10)` is likely behind the shutters `(17, 6)` or `(20, 6)`. If this room is a dead end, I need to figure out how to open those shutters.
