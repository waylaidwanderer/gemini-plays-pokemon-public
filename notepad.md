# Blocked Routes (Verified)
- Central City: Vertical wall at X=9 (Rows 34-37). Cliff at Row 30.
- Plateau Access: Row 29 is a clear East-West path from X=19 to X=2, bypassing the Row 30 cliff and city walls.
- Southern Corridor: Row 47/48 provides a path from the east side (X=19) to the west beach (X=2), bypassing the central maze.
- Row 50 Cliff: Impassable wall from X=12 to X=19.

# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The Great Northern Buoy Loop
- Plan:
  1. Use Super Repel. [DONE]
  2. Navigate to (19, 30) and Surf. [IN PROGRESS]
  3. Navigate to (23, 15) then (26, 15) to bypass X=22 wall.
  4. Navigate North to Row 6, then West to (19, 6) through the X=22 gap.
  5. Navigate South to (19, 11) then West to land at (16, 11).
  6. Walk to (14, 10).
- Status: At (18, 45) on land.
- Reasoning: The city is a vertical maze on land. The buoy walls have specific gaps at Row 6 and Row 15/10 that allow access to the northern plateau pocket.

# General Lessons
- City Layouts: In Johto cities like Cianwood, horizontal paths (Rows) often bypass vertical blockades (Walls) even if they look like a maze. Always check the full length of a Row for gaps.
