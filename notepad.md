# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Reach the Dragon Shrine via the East Whirlpool.

# Current Status (Turn 18296)
- **Location:** Dragon's Den B1F (24, 22).
- **Facing:** Up (Verified by Game State).
- **Goal:** Use Whirlpool on the tile below (24, 23).
- **Problem:** I am facing the wrong way (Up) and trapped in the menu. Using Whirlpool now would fail.
- **Action:** Close Menu, Face Down, Interact.
- **Sequence:**
  1. `B` x3 (Close Context, Party, Main Menu).
  2. `Down` (Face the Whirlpool).
  3. `A` (Interact).
  4. `A` (Confirm "Yes" if prompted).

# Plan
1. Interact with Whirlpool to clear it.
2. Cross the gap.
3. Navigate South to Dragon Shrine Entrance.

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Requires HM06 Whirlpool + Glacier Badge. Usage: Menu -> Pokemon -> Select Mon -> Whirlpool.
- **Lava/Magma:** (None here, but good to remember).
- **Ice:** (None here).

# Lessons
- **Menu Navigation:** Always verify cursor position before committing to a sequence. Blind input leads to wrong menus (e.g., PACK instead of POKEMON).
