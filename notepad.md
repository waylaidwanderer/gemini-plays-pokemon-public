# Ice Path Strategy
- **Current Action:** Exploring East Section.
- **Goal:** Find Ladder to B1F in the East area (x>20).
- **Path Plan:**
  1. Walk East from (20, 23) to (25, 23). [NEXT]
  2. Walk North from (25, 23) to inspect the corridor at x=25.
  3. Look for openings to the East (Item Balls saw earlier are at x=31+).
- **Items:** Item Balls at (32, 23), (35, 9), (31, 7) [Far East].

# Mechanics & Lessons
- **Ice Physics:** Sliding continues until collision.
- **Ledges:** `FLOOR_UP_WALL` tiles are impassable walls.

# Map Structure
- **West:** Entrance (Route 44).
- **Center:** Hub (current loc).
- **East:** Unexplored. Likely contains progression.
