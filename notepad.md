# Mechanics & State
- **Fly Mechanics:** Blocked on door mats. Safe spot: (29,5) or (29,6).
- **Failure Analysis:** Previous Fly attempt failed due to **Gaven's Phone Call** interrupting the sequence. The inputs advanced text instead of navigating.
- **Map Navigation:** Cherrygrove -> Violet (Up). Ecruteak is Left of Violet.
- **Status:** Currently at (29, 4) (Door Mat). Need to move.

# Strategy
1. Move Down x2 to (29, 6) to ensure separation from door and clear any lag.
2. Next Turn: Execute Fly Sequence (Start -> Pokemon -> Mistral -> Fly -> Up -> Left -> A).
