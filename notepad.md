# Current Objectives
*   **Primary Goal:** Obtain the Boulder Badge from the Pewter City Gym Leader, Brock.
*   **Secondary Goal:** Acquire sufficient funds (¬•) for Potions and train SPROUT (Oddish) to an effective level for the Gym battle by exploring east of Pewter City.
*   **Tertiary Goal:** Systematically explore all 'Reachable Unseen Tiles' in new areas and investigate 'Reachable Undiscovered Map Connections' as they become available.

# Pewter City Strategy & Current Focus
*   **Immediate Priority (CRITICAL):** Successfully navigate to and explore the 'Reachable Undiscovered Map Connection' to the East of Pewter City. This is the primary avenue for finding trainers to earn money (current: ¬•156) and gain EXP for SPROUT.
*   **Financial Priority:** Defeat trainers for money to afford Potions (¬•200 each) and other supplies.
*   **Oddish Training for Brock:** SPROUT (ODDISH Lv7) needs significant training. The current level cap for 0 badges is 12.
*   **Map Markers:** Consistently use map markers for defeated trainers (‚ò†Ô∏è), used warps (üö™), key locations (üìç), non-battling NPCs (‚ÑπÔ∏è), and confirmed dead ends/impassable tiles (üö´).

# Pok√©mon Center Tasks (Next Visit)
*   **Heal Pok√©mon.**
*   **Agent Management (CRITICAL):
    *   **Verify Active Agent List:** Before any further agent deletions or definitions, I *must* check the PC to confirm the actual list of currently active custom agents. My notes about `advanced_pathfinder_agent` and `direct_pathing_agent` were incorrect as they weren't found.
    *   **Low-Usage Agent Review:** Re-evaluate `item_finder_agent`, `pokedex_completer_agent`, `team_builder_agent`, `leveling_training_advisor_agent`. Improve their prompts/utility for active use, or delete them to free up agent slots (currently at 10/10 limit, assuming no phantom agents).
    *   **Address 'New Agent Ideas':** Make decisions on defining `route_progress_analyzer_agent` and `risk_assessor_agent` (requires deletion of existing agent(s) if limit is met) or explicitly discard these ideas.
    *   Investigate `exploration_planner_agent` failure on Turn 3777 if it's to be relied upon.
*   **Financial Planning:** Re-assess funds and purchase Potions if affordable.

# Current Pok√©mon Status
*   SPROUT (ODDISH): Lv7 (25/25 HP, EXP: 262). Moves: TACKLE, POISONPOWDER.
*   SPBARKY (PIKACHU): Lv12 (39/39 HP, EXP: 1728). **AT LEVEL CAP (12).** Moves: THUNDERSHOCK, TAIL WHIP, QUICK ATTACK, THUNDER WAVE.

# Inventory & Finances
*   POK√© BALL x2
*   Money: ¬•156

# Hard Mode Rules & ROM Hack Changes (Summary)
*   Battle Style: Set. No items in battle. Level caps apply (current 0 badges: 12. Brock's Ace Onix Lv14 -> cap before Brock: 14).
*   HMs: Forgettable, menu use, not PC storable. All 151 obtainable. Trade evos by level. Smarter AI. Tougher bosses. EXP. All early.

# Navigation Strategy & Best Practices (CRITICAL - MUST ADHERE)
*   **Meticulous Tile-by-Tile Verification (ABSOLUTE PRIORITY):** Before *any* movement segment, consult map memory (XML) and verify `navigable="true"` and `type` of *every single tile*. XML is sole truth for player movement.
*   **Short, Verifiable Segments:** Path segments MUST be short (3-5 tiles max) or cover single, clear small areas, especially in dense or unfamiliar locations. Each chunk 100% confirmed navigable from XML *before* execution. Break down longer paths.
*   **Use `move_validator_agent` (CRITICAL):** Before executing *any* planned path segment longer than a single step, use `move_validator_agent` to confirm path validity against the map XML. This is essential to prevent wasted turns.
*   **Map Marker Usage (IMMEDIATE & ABSOLUTE):** *Immediately* mark confirmed dead ends/impassable tiles (üö´), key navigational turns/points (üìç), and important warps (üö™) after discovery/use. Essential for spatial understanding.
*   **Pikachu Interaction:** Account for turning mechanic if moving onto Pikachu's tile from a non-facing direction.
*   **`navigable="false"` is Absolute:** If XML shows `navigable="false"`, it is IMPASSABLE by player. Trust this attribute explicitly.
*   **Full Path Execution:** When a multi-step path is validated (e.g., by `move_validator_agent`), provide the *entire* sequence of button presses in the `buttons_to_press` array for that turn. Partial execution can lead to unintended consequences.

# Recent Events & Learnings (Pewter City)
*   **Pathing Challenges:** Multiple pathing attempts within Pewter City (to Super Nerd at (27,26) and eastern exit) failed due to unexpected impassable tiles (e.g., (27,24), (32,13), (30,24), (31,25), (18,22), (19,19)-(19,21)). This highlights the need for more careful pre-validation checks and shorter path segments.
*   **Youngster Gym Escort Event (Turns 3841-3843):** Youngster NPC (ID 5), previously a Gym Guide, initiated dialogue and forcibly moved the player from (38,19) to (12,19), directly in front of the Pewter Gym. This was a scripted event and did not involve a battle. The Youngster is now at (36,17) (his original blocking position).
*   **Strategy Shift:** Due to repeated pathing failures within Pewter City and the critical need for funds/EXP, the strategy has shifted to prioritize exploring the eastern 'Reachable Undiscovered Map Connection'.

# Archived Learnings & Notes (Condensed)
*   Older battle logs, detailed early game event triggers, specific NPC dialogue not immediately relevant. Repel Mechanics: Lead Pok√©mon level must be *strictly greater* than wild Pok√©mon level. `exploration_planner` Misuse: Agent is strictly for 'Reachable Unseen Tiles', not for paths to known, seen tiles.

# Current Tactical Plan (High-Level)
1.  Mark newly discovered impassable tiles as they are found.
2.  Validate and execute a path to the eastern map connection (e.g., (40,18)) of Pewter City.
3.  Explore the new route for trainers and items.
4.  Train SPROUT and earn money for Potions.
5.  Re-evaluate readiness for Brock's Gym.

# Pewter City Navigation Anomalies (Turn 3855)
*   **Unexpected Movement Jump:** During the execution of the `map_analyzer_agent`'s path on turn 3854, the 'Screens During Movement' log showed an unexplained jump from (20,22) to (22,23) when the intended move was to (20,23). This resulted in landing at (22,24) instead of the agent's target (20,23).
*   **XML vs. Screen Discrepancy:** The `map_xml_string` for Pewter City listed tile (13,13) as 'impassable' and `navigable="false"`. However, the 'Screens During Movement' log for turn 3854 clearly showed the player sprite on (13,13) and the tile visually appearing as navigable ground. This suggests an inaccuracy in the provided XML for that specific tile.

# Critical Pathing Learnings (Turn 3860)
*   **`move_validator_agent` Path Retention:** The game may retain and attempt to execute the *full* path validated by `move_validator_agent`, even if only a partial button sequence is provided in the `buttons_to_press` for a turn. This can lead to unintended movements, warps, or blocks if the full path isn't re-evaluated after partial execution or if the game state changes. Ensure that if a validated path is interrupted, any subsequent movement re-validates from the new current position or uses only the *remaining correct segment* if absolutely certain of the game state and path validity. Best practice is to re-validate or use very short, certain segments if a long path is broken.

# Youngster Gym Escort Event Conclusion (Turn 3865)
*   The Youngster NPC (ID 5), who previously acted as a Gym Guide and then escorted me to the Gym, finished his dialogue after forcibly moving me to (12,19) in front of the Pewter Gym.
*   His final dialogue was "If you have the right stuff, go take on BROCK!".
*   The Youngster (ID 5) is now located at (18,19) according to the game state, blocking the direct path east along row 19.
*   My strategy to explore the eastern map connection for funds and EXP remains the priority, as I am unprepared for Brock.
