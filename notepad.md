# Kanto Campaign Status
- **Location:** Cerulean Pokemon Center.
- **Current Objective:** Reach the Power Plant via Route 9.
- **Immediate Task:** Execute Menu Sequence: Exit all menus (B x5), Start, Up, A (Pokemon), Down x4 (Select Belladonna), A, A (Cut).
- **Observation:** Verified cursor persistence: exiting the menu leaves the cursor on the last selected Pokemon (Garnet/Slot 2). Therefore, from a fresh menu open, I need 4 Downs to reach Belladonna (Slot 6).
- **Backup:** If this fails, the tree requires a specific event or badge (though I have Hive). Next step would be to investigate the house at (30, 23).

# Strategic Goals
1. **Restore Power:**
   - Investigate Power Plant (East of Cerulean, end of Route 9).
   - Fix the Generator (likely requires a part).
2. **Wake Snorlax:**
   - Requires Poke Flute functionality (Radio expansion card?).
   - Requires Power restored.
3. **Collect Kanto Badges:**
   - [x] Vermilion (Thunder)
   - [x] Saffron (Marsh)
   - [ ] Cerulean (Cascade) - Misty?
   - [ ] Celadon (Rainbow)
   - [ ] Fuchsia (Soul)
   - [ ] Pewter (Boulder)
   - [ ] Viridian (Earth)
   - [ ] Cinnabar (Volcano)
