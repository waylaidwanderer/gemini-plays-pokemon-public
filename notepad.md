## Current Mission
- **Primary Objective:** Defeat the Violet City Gym Leader.

## Game Mechanics & Quirks
- **Headbutt Trees:** Some trees are 'HEADBUTT_TREE' type and are impassable.
- **Dialogue Triggers:** Some dialogues might loop until another specific NPC in the room is spoken to (e.g., Elm's Lab).
- **Wild Encounters:** Can be triggered on 'FLOOR' tiles if they are adjacent to 'TALL_GRASS' tiles. (Observed on Route 30).
- **One-Way Paths:** The gatehouse between Route 29 and Route 46 appears to be a one-way path.
- **Ledge Mechanics:** I can move sideways (left/right) along 'HOP_DOWN' tiles on Route 29.
- **Shifting Mazes:** Some routes, like Route 29, can have their layouts change with each step, requiring constant path recalculation.

## Agent Performance & Lessons
- **Trust Agents:** I must trust my agents' calculations over my own intuition.
- **Systematic Updates:** When a new game mechanic is discovered, ALL relevant agents must be updated immediately.
