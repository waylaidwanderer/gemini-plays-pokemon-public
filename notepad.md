# Strategic Objectives

# Key Mechanics & Lessons
- **Field Moves:** If 'A' interaction fails (even when facing correctly), ALWAYS fallback to Menu -> Pokemon -> [Mon] -> [Move].
- **Whirlpool:** Requires facing the whirlpool tile directly. 'A' button might be unreliable; Menu is safer.

- Reason: Position corrected (Facing Down). Now accessing Party Menu to activate Whirlpool.
- Step 1: Press 'Start' to open menu.
- Step 2: Select 'POKéMON'.
- Step 3: Select Lapis -> Whirlpool.
