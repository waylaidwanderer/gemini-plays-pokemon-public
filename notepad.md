# Strategic Notes
## Objectives
- **Primary:** Reach Indigo Plateau (Money Farming Loop).
- **Secondary:** Defeat Elite Four.
- **Tertiary:** Hunt Roamers (Raikou/Entei) - *Paused*.

## Current Task: Traverse Victory Road 2F (South U-Turn)
- **Location:** Victory Road 2F (ID: 3_91) at (5, 38).
- **Goal:** Reach Ladder at (13, 31).
- **Route:** `(5, 38) -> North to (5, 35) -> East to (10, 35) -> South to (10, 42) -> East to (13, 42) -> North to (13, 31)`.
- **Reasoning:**
  - Path verified via Mental Map.
  - Row 35 connects West to Center.
  - Row 42 connects Center to East.
  - Column 13 connects South (Row 42) to North (Row 31 Ladder).

## Status
- **Money:** ¥3294.
- **Party:** Gyarados (Lead), Lugia, Machoke, Pidgey, Oddish, Quilava.

## Reflection (Turn 32967)
- **Execution:** No deferred tasks identified in the last 50 turns.
- **Hygiene:** Notepad sections are relevant. Map markers are active and accurate.
- **Tools:** Current navigation challenges are due to map topology (vertical stacking), not tool deficiency. Standard `navigate` is sufficient with manual warp handling.
- **Goals:** Primary goal (Indigo Plateau) remains valid. Strategy shifted from 2F West (blocked/bugged ledge) to 1F Southeast (exploration).
- **Lesson:** Victory Road (3_91) is a single map with stacked floors. Navigation tools see it as one continuous area but cannot pathfind through warps automatically. I must manually step off and onto ladders to transition between floors.
- **Plan:** Trigger warp at (1, 35) to return to 1F, then traverse the southern corridor to the East section.
