# Gem's Gameplay Log & Strategies

## 1. Game Mechanics & Lessons Learned
*   **Poison Damage:** Poisoned Pokémon lose 1 HP every four steps outside of battle.
*   **Battle Tactics:** If a move repeatedly fails (e.g., accuracy drops), switch to a guaranteed-hit move or a different Pokémon. Don't stick to a failing strategy.
*   **WKG Management:** Execute all tool calls from an agent's multi-step plan sequentially.
*   **NPC Sprites:** Defeated trainer sprites can sometimes temporarily block paths.
*   **Risk Management:** Avoid exploring deep into new, dangerous areas with a significantly injured party. Prioritize healing.

## 2. Current Objective
*   **Primary Goal:** Obtain the Cascade Badge in Cerulean City.
*   **Immediate Task:** Heal the party at the Route 4 Pokémon Center.
*   **Next Step:** Explore the rest of Route 4 to find the path to Cerulean City.

## Lessons from Route 4 / Mt. Moon Retreat
*   The 'Cool Trainer F' on the west side of Route 4 is a non-hostile event NPC, not a trainer. Interacting with her triggers a text event about a Geodude. Don't waste time trying to battle her.
*   The lower, ledge-filled area of Route 4 is a one-way path designed to loop back from the east. It is not the path forward to Cerulean City.
*   A full retreat from a dungeon is a massive time loss. It's better to press on with an injured party if possible, rather than reset all progress.
