# Current Objectives
*   **Primary Goal:** Obtain the Boulder Badge from the Pewter City Gym Leader, Brock.
*   **Secondary Goal:** Acquire sufficient funds to purchase essential supplies. (Current Money: ¥156)
*   **Tertiary Goal:** Battle trainers on Route 3 for funds.

# Pewter City - Path to Route 3 (Current Plan)
*   **Current Location (Game State):** (30,19) in Pewter City, facing Right. Pikachu at (29,19).
*   **Immediate Goal:** Move 10 tiles East from (30,19) to (40,19) to reach the Route 3 exit.

# Lessons Learned - Pewter Navigation Summary
*   Pewter City navigation has been challenging, with multiple failed attempts to find a clear path to Route 3 due to blockades (e.g., (19,19), (19,21), (13,17), NPC at (9,16)) and complex detours.
*   Reliance on `map_analyzer_agent` has been key, though `exploration_planner_agent` has been unreliable recently.
*   It's crucial to ensure notepad plans align with the *actual* game state, especially current player position, to avoid confusion.

# Known Pathing Obstacles in Pewter City (Key Blockers)
*   (19,21) & (19,19) - Impassable (blocks eastward movement from Gym area pocket).
*   (18,18) - Impassable (N. Wall of W. Pocket).
*   (5,22) & (17,22) - Impassable (blocks southward movement from western corridors).
*   (13,17) - Impassable (blocks eastward movement along Y=17 from X=12).
*   Cool Trainer F at (9,16) blocks passage on Y=16.
*   (34,20) - Impassable building facade.
*   X=36 column is largely impassable from Y=21 down to Y=32 (house structures).

# Agent Usage Plan
*   **`map_analyzer_agent`:** Primary tool for pathfinding in complex areas. Critically review its output.
*   **`move_validator_agent`:** Use for genuinely complex, risky, or unclear path segments. Avoid overuse for simple, straight paths.
*   **`exploration_planner_agent`:** Has been unreliable. Will monitor; may need prompt review if issues persist.
*   **`scripted_event_tracker_agent`:** Keep in mind for areas with known scripted events (e.g., Youngster near Route 3 exit if direct pathing fails again).
*   **`money_management_agent`:** Use once sufficient funds are acquired.
*   **`route_progress_analyzer_agent`:** Use once on Route 3.
*   **`battle_log_analyzer_agent`:** Use after battles.

# Game Mechanics & Strategy Notes
*   **Ledge Mechanics:** One-way (downwards only).
*   **Movement:** 1st press TURNS if not facing, 2nd press MOVES. Pikachu: 1st press turns, 2nd moves if moving *into* his tile and not facing him.
*   **Level Cap:** 0 badges = Lv12.
*   **Map Marker Legend:** 💥 (Event Trigger), 🎯 (Key Nav Point), ❗ (Risky Zone/Obstacle), 💁 (Event NPCs), ☠️ (Defeated), 🏛️ (Building), 📍 (Path Start), 🧱 (Impassable), 🚪 (Used Warp), ℹ️ (Info NPC).
*   **Tile Navigability:** Inferred from tile `type` and objects. Cross-reference screen, XML, and game state.

# Party Status
*   SPBARKY (PIKACHU): Lv12 (39/39 HP) (Capped)
*   FLAREE (VULPIX): Lv8 (26/26 HP)
*   ODDISH (ODDISH): Lv12 (37/37 HP) (Capped)

# Hindsight & Lessons Learned (General & Recent Critiques)
*   **Notepad Sync:** ALWAYS ensure notepad plans (especially current location & immediate steps) are synchronized with the actual game state. Overwrite outdated sections promptly.
*   **Goal Formulation:** Goals should describe OUTCOMES, not methods (e.g., "Battle trainers on Route 3" not "Reach Route 3 to battle trainers").
*   **Agent Output Review:** Critically review agent-provided paths against screen and map XML. Agents can make mistakes or provide paths that become invalid due to new information.
*   **Simplify Pathing:** When a direct path is clear (e.g., straight line, no obstacles), avoid over-validating with agents. Execute longer movement sequences.
*   **Map Awareness:** Continuously reinforce mental model of the current map, especially locations of known persistent obstacles.
