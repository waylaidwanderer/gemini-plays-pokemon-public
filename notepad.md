# Reflection (Turn 28611)
- **Status:** In Route 36 Grass, preparing to hunt Roamers.
- **Execution:** Recovered from menu navigation errors by using `slow_press` and visual confirmation.
- **Lesson:** Start Menu navigation requires strict state tracking. Visual confirmation is safer than blind input chains.
- **Hunt Start:** Turn 28611.
- **Strategy:** Max Repel active. Gyarados (Lv 36) Lead. Run in grass. If encounter != Roamer, Run. If Roamer, Master Ball (if available) or Sleep.

# Legendary Beast Tracking
- Search Mode: Blind Hunt (Repel Trick).
- Target: Raikou (#238) & Entei (#239).
- Strategy: Relocating to Route 36/37 Border.

- Current Step: Moving West through Route 36 to reach Route 37 Gate.
- Status: Max Repel ACTIVE.
- Note: Be careful of Lass at (53, 8) on Route 36. Use manual pathing.
