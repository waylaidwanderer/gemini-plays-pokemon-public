# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard walkable ground.
- WATER: Traversable only while Surfing (requires HM03).
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- WALL: Impassable obstacle.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way barrier (Ledge). Blocks movement Up (North) and allows jumping Down (South).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump South. Entering from the side (Left/Right) is blocked.
- Interaction: To Surf, face WATER from an adjacent FLOOR tile and press A. Stepping onto FLOOR from WATER automatically ends Surfing.

# Suicune Quest
- Start Turn: 46650
- Objective: Trigger sighting in Cianwood City at (7, 4).
- Strategy:
    1. Mechanic Verification: Test ledge jumping at (6, 34) with manual press_buttons.
    2. Walk north to (12, 19).
    3. Walk west to (4, 19).
    4. Jump south over the ledge at (4, 20) to land at (4, 21).
    5. Walk west to (2, 21).
    6. Walk north along X=2 to Y=4.
    7. Walk east to (7, 4) to trigger the sighting.
- Note: This path bypasses the main city walls and ledges that block direct northern access. X=2 is the key north-south corridor.

# Roaming Beast Data
- Raikou: Unknown
- Entei: Unknown
- Suicune Sightings: 1 (Ecruteak), 2 (Cianwood - Pending)

# Strategy: Capture all Legendary Pokemon
- Requirements: Clear Bell (Owned), 16 Badges (Owned).
- Plan: Complete sightings -> Tin Tower -> Capture Suicune (Lv 40).

# Lessons Learned
- Verify "gaps" in walls and buoy lines using tools like run_code or pathfinders before committing to long detours. My assumption of a solid wall led to a 100+ turn detour that was unnecessary.
- BUOY tiles at X=16 and X=18 create a channel at X=17, but it is blocked at Y=25. X=15 is clear for North/South travel between Y=16 and Y=31.
