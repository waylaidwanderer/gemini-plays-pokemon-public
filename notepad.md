# Reflection (Turn 22795)
- **Status:** Box 1 Full (20/20). Cannot catch until Pewter City PC.
- **Map:** Route 2 (East). Diglett's Cave Exit is at (12, 7). Nugget House at (15, 15).
- **Goal:** Reach Pewter City. Path North from cave is blocked. Exploring East side.
- **Performance:** Navigation successful. Fisher interaction required correction (positioning).
- **Plan:** Exit House -> Explore South/East for Cut tree or path to Pewter.
- Received NUGGET from Fisher.
- House is a dead end (no back exit).
- Action: Exiting to Route 2 to continue search for path to Pewter City.
- Check: Can I go further South on Route 2 East side? Or is there a cuttable tree?
- Cutting tree at (15, 18).
- Path forward: South/East towards Pewter City.
- Box 1 Full. Priority: Reach PC.
- Cut confirmed. Tree at (15, 18) removed.
- Path to South/East is now open.
- Proceeding towards Pewter City.
- Cut tree at (15, 18) leads to Ledges (One-way South?). Avoiding for now.
- Re-evaluating North path: East side of Nugget House (x>17) seems open North.
- Backtracking to (18, 16) and heading North to find Pewter City.
- At (19, 3), facing North towards Item Ball at (19, 2).
- Observation: North (Row 1) appears to be a wall.
- Hypothesis: This is the North-East corner. Path to Pewter City likely continues West along Row 2/3.
- Action: Pick up item, then navigate West.
- Picked up Carbos.
- Path North is blocked by a wall at Row 1.
- Navigating West along the corridor (Row 2/3) to find the path to Pewter City.
- Avoiding ledges at Row 4 for now to maintain height.
- Phone call from Gaven (Cooltrainer) completed.
- North path (Row 3) is a dead end blocked by walls at x=10 and y=0.
- Strategy: Jump ledge at (14, 4) to shortcut back to Diglett's Cave area.
- Next Plan: Explore South through the Cut tree at (15, 18) to find a path West/North to Pewter.
- Jumped ledge at (11, 4) to return to main area.
- Northern path was a dead end (Item only).
- Now proceeding to (15, 18) to explore South past the cut tree.
- Navigating South through the Cut Tree area.
- Identified a gap in the ledges at (17, 21).
- Hypothesis: This path loops West and then North to Pewter City (West side of Route 2).
- Navigated through ledge gap at (17, 21).
- Now at (17, 22), South of the ledges.
- Heading West to (11, 22) to find the main path (likely leads South to Viridian or North to Pewter).
- Hypothesis: This connects to the main Route 2 path.
- Blocked West at (14, 22). Wall separates East/West sides.
- Navigating South through gap at (17, 23).
- Found building entrance at Row 26. Investigating if this connects to West side or Viridian.
- Backup Plan: Backtrack to Diglett's Cave and check North of (12, 7) (previously skipped).
- Marking and entering building at (17, 27).
- Hope: This connects to the West side of Route 2 (North path to Pewter) or is a gatehouse.
