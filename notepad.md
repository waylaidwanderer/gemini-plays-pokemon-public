# Lessons Learned
- **Verification:** Always verify possession of Key Items (like EXPN Card) in the inventory before attempting to use them. Do not assume they were acquired during story events.
- **Troubleshooting:** If a mechanic (like the Radio) fails, check the prerequisites (Key Items) first before blaming the mechanics (tuning).
- **Route 8:** Underground Path is closed (shut down by police). Bikers control the surface road.
