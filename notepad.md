- Gap at (11, 15) is FLOOR and allows northward passage.
- Water at Row 16-24 blocks land passage. Surf required.
- Landing point: (12, 16) is FLOOR.

# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Cliff face (Impassable).

# Failed Hypotheses
- Attempting to go around via Row 51 (Multiple failures due to unseen cliffs).

- Attempting to walk north via X=12 (Blocked by water at Row 24).
