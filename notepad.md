# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Cross Whirlpool at (24, 23) using Lapis (Slot 3).

# Navigation & Discovery
- **Connections:** 1F (5, 15) <-> B1F (20, 3).
- **Location:** Dragon's Den B1F (East Side).
- **Target:** Dragon Shrine (likely South/Central island).
- **Insight:** Whirlpools (BUOY tiles) require HM06. Direct interaction ('A') failed. Must use Party Menu.

# Team Status
- **Health:** Full.
- **Party:** Gyarados, Quilava, Lapis (HM Slave), Machoke, Sneasel, Swinub.

# Tile Mechanics
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN**: One-way (South).
- **FLOOR/WALL**: Standard.
- **PIT**: Drops to lower floor.
- **LADDER**: Vertical transport.
- **WARP**: Map transition.
- **WATER**: Surf required.
- **BUOY**: Whirlpool (Requires HM06).
- Mechanic Test: Attempting direct interaction ('A') with Whirlpool at (24, 23) while facing DOWN. Previous failure was likely due to facing UP. If this works, menu navigation is unnecessary.
