## Strategy: Reaching Suicune Overworld Sighting
**Start Turn:** 48900 (Quest: Trigger Suicune Overworld Sighting)

Cianwood's geography is a maze of buoy walls and one-way ledges. I am using the Inner Channel gaps at Row 16 and Row 10 to reach the northern plateau.

### Step-by-Step Execution Plan
1. Move to (27, 38) and Surf North to Row 16. <- CURRENT TASK
2. Navigate buoy gaps: (22, 16) -> (21, 16) then North to Row 10.
3. Surf West along Row 10 to land on the plateau at (16, 10) or (16, 11).
4. Walk to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune sighting.

## Tile Mechanics: Cianwood City
- FLOOR: Standard ground.
- WALL: Impassable barrier.
- WATER: Surf required.
- BUOY: Impassable water barrier.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way ledge. Blocks DOWN movement. Allows UP and East-West movement. (Verified at (6, 46)).

## Navigation: Verified Gaps
- X=26 Wall: Gap at Row 10-15.
- X=22 Wall: Gap at Row 16-24.
- X=18 Wall: Gap at Row 26 and potentially Row 10-14 (unseen).

## Failed Hypotheses & Lessons
- Row 8 Bypass: Blocked by BUOY at (26, 8).
- Terrestrial Row 52: Blocked by WATER at (23, 32).
- Direct South Walk: Blocked by FLOOR_UP_WALL at Row 46.

## Inventory Check
- Super Repel: 5 remaining. Last applied turn 49278 (Expired 49311). Re-apply after starting Surf.
- Party: Calcifer (Lv 64) leads. Ready for Eusine.
