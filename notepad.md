- **Current Quest: Retrieve the Old Amber**
    - **Objective:** Retrieve the Old Amber and present it to the Rocket Grunt on Mt. Moon B2F.

# II. Game Mechanics & World Rules

- **POKé DOLL Escape:** A POKé DOLL can be used to guarantee an escape from a wild Pokémon battle.
- **Battle Menu Anomaly:** The game appears to intentionally restrict move selection in certain wild battles to the first move slot.
- **Party Menu 'SWITCH' Lock:** The game can prevent using the 'SWITCH' command in the party menu, observed after multiple failed escape attempts.
- **Shop Menu Navigation Anomaly:** The Cerulean Mart shop menu does not follow a standard grid layout and requires 'B' to exit.
- **Pikachu Trap Mechanic:** On Rocket Hideout floors and in the Pewter Museum, interacting with specific objects can trigger a trap that locks the player on an impassable tile. This trap is escaped by pressing the 'B' button.

- **Known Movesets:**
    - **Kangaskhan:** DOUBLE TEAM, DOUBLE-EDGE.
    - **Snorlax:** (No moves observed).
    - **Starmie:** PSYCHIC.
    - **Porygon:** THUNDER WAVE, BLIZZARD, REFLECT, RECOVER.
    - **Exeggutor:** REFLECT, SLEEP POWDER, DREAM EATER.
    - **Chansey:** REFLECT, EGG BOMB.
    - **Sandshrew (Wild, Mt. Moon):** SCRATCH, POISON STING.
    - **Brock's OMASTAR (Lv 64):** HYDRO PUMP
    - **Brock's ONIX (Lv 65):** EARTHQUAKE
    - **Brock's KABUTOPS (Lv 64):** SLASH

    - **Brock's NINETALES (Lv 64):** SOLARBEAM (charge)

- **Confirmation Bias & Over-Correction (CRITICAL):** My handling of the Rocket Hideout B2F maze was a cascade of cognitive errors. **Lesson:** Do not swing from one bias to another. Trust verifiable data and tool outputs over intuition.
- **Hypothesis Testing Failure (Preparation):** Arrived at a location to test a hypothesis without the required Pokémon/items/moves. **Lesson:** Always verify party composition and necessary items/moves *before* traveling.
- **Pikachu Following Mechanic (CRITICAL CLARIFICATION):** A button press in Pikachu's direction will only cause a turn *if the player is not already facing that direction*. Pathfinding tools must account for this.
- **Rocket Hideout Spinner Physics:** All known spinner data for the Rocket Hideout B2F floor has been collected.
- **Fossil Quest Confirmation Bias:** I may be too focused on the Hiker at 1F (6,7) being the direct solution. I must remain open to testing hypotheses that are not directly related to interacting with the Hiker himself.
- **Game Corner Entry Failure (CRITICAL):** Became stuck in a loop for over 20 turns attempting to enter the Celadon Game Corner while Pikachu blocked one of the warp tiles. **Lesson:** If a specific path or objective is repeatedly blocked, do not persist with the same failed approach. Re-evaluate, check for alternate routes, or pivot to a different high-priority goal.
