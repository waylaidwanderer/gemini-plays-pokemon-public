# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Current Task
- **Map 4_9**: Ecruteak City.
- **Plan**: Heal Garnet, Teach Bolin Rock Smash (TM08).
- **Burned Tower**: Entrance at (5, 5).
- **Goal**: Find the B1F drop on Map 3_13 (Burned Tower 1F).
- **Hypothesis**: The beasts are in the center of 3_13. Need Rock Smash to explore fully.

- **URGENT**: Garnet is POISONED (PSN). Need to find the drop/beasts quickly or retreat to heal.

- **Map 3_13**: Tile (15, 4) is a BREAKABLE ROCK (impassable), despite being TYPE_3fe2. BFS will fail here. Go around via the Left side (Col 4).
- **Map 3_13**: Item at (14, 2) is blocked by Breakable Rock at (15, 4). Requires Rock Smash.
- **Exploration**: Checking bottom-right area (Cols 14-16) before leaving.
- **Correction**: Nurse Joy is at (4,1). The NPC at (3,1) is a generic NPC.
