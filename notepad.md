- **PC/COUNTER/SIGN:** Impassable. Interact from an adjacent tile.

# Progress Tracking
- Route 42 Island Search: Thoroughly searched Turn 24851-24860. No Suicune sprite or Eusine sighting. Trigger might require Route 36 sighting first or a specific approach.
- Route 36 Search: Briefly checked Turn 24733. Need exhaustive search.
