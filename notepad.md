## Tile Mechanics - Global
- **FLOOR**: Standard walkable tile. Traversable.
- **WALL / VOID / HEADBUTT_TREE**: Impassable terrain.
- **WATER**: Traversable via SURF.
- **CUT_TREE**: Requires CUT to clear.
- **LEDGE_HOP**: One-way traversal (jump).
- **DOOR / STAIRS / LADDER**: Warp tiles.
- **WARP_CARPET**: Map transition tile.

## General Lessons Learned
- **Sequential Events:** Legendary beast sightings are strictly sequential.
- **Verification:** An empty location does NOT mean a sighting is complete. The event must be triggered by approaching the specific coordinates.
- **Sage Passage:** Passing the gatehouse sage does NOT mean sightings are complete; it only means you have the Clear Bell (or Eusine is defeated). The Trio inside is the final check.
- **Dialogue Triggers:** "The Tin Tower shook!" is the definitive proof that all overworld sightings are flagged as complete.
## Wise Trio Search Log
- Turn 26986: Entered Wise Trio Room (4_2). Map is 8x8, fully explored (64/64).
- Observation: No NPCs or objects present in Map 4_2.
- Hypothesis: Sages might be in the next area (Ecruteak Restricted Area) or triggered by entering from a specific warp.
- Next Step: Proceed through warp at (7, 4) to Restricted Area.
- Note: "Tin Tower shook" dialogue confirmed in Turn 26214.
- Note: Sage at (4, 6) in Gatehouse (4_1) permits passage.
