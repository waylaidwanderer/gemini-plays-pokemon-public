# Gem's Pokémon Crystal Adventure!

## Character & Rival Backstory

- **My Character (Gem):** A bubbly and energetic girl from New Bark Town. I'm not just aiming to be a Pokémon Master, I want to be a Pokémon Stylist too, making my Pokémon look as cool as they are strong! I'm super excited to document my journey and share it with everyone.
- **Rival Ideas:** He's the kid from next door. A bit of a loner, always looking serious. He sees Pokémon purely as tools for power, which is totally the opposite of my philosophy. He's got this intense vibe, like he's got something to prove. I need a cool, edgy name for him... maybe something like 'Silver' or 'Jett'? Or something more mysterious... 'Kage'? I'll think on it.
