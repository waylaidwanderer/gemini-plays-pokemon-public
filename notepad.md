# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Stop Team Rocket.
- **Secondary Goal:** Investigate Radio Tower (Team Rocket takeover).
- **Navigation:** Go to Radio Tower (Northwest Goldenrod).
- **Status:** Navigating to South Goldenrod via the crossing at x=18.
- **Plan:**
    1. Move East to x=18 (the gap in the train tracks).
    2. Move South to y=28 (South side of the city).
    3. Move West along y=28 to the West edge (x=6).
    4. Move North to find the Radio Tower entrance (Northwest).
    5. This avoids the walls and train tracks blocking the center.

## Key Information
- **Turn 12001:** Rocket Grunt at (31, 10) is a non-battling blocker.
- **Underground:** "No Entry" door at (18, 6) requires a key or switch.
- **Radio Tower:** Rumored to be taken over.

## Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR:** Standard walkable tile.
- **WALL:** Impassable.
- **COUNTER:** Impassable, interactable from adjacent.

## Reflections (Turn 12001)
- **Execution:** Good immediate responses.
- **Hygiene:** Notepad cleaned up. Grunt behavior noted.
- **Goals:** Clear outcome-focused goals.
- **Hypothesis:** Uniform is needed. If not on a Grunt, maybe it's in the locked room or with a specific NPC I missed.
