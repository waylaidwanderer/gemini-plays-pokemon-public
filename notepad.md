# Gem's Pokémon Yellow Legacy - Hard Mode Playthrough

## Actionable Lessons & Strategy
- **PC Menu Solution (Pewter City):** The correct menu option to access Pokémon Storage is 'SOMEONE's PC', not 'Gem's PC'. Selecting 'Gem's PC' repeatedly leads to a loop into the Item Storage.
- **Verify First:** Before assuming a block, verify my position and facing direction.
- **Systematic Navigation:** When a path isn't obvious, systematically explore boundaries instead of brute-forcing. Trust the 'reachable' flag.
- **USE YOUR AGENTS:** Use agents proactively for planning, not just reactively when stuck.
- **Efficient Training:** Don't travel across half the world to train when a suitable location is nearby. Analyze the current area for opportunities first.
