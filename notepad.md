## Strategy: Northern Plateau Access via Buoy Bypass
**Start Turn:** 48900 (Quest: Trigger Suicune Overworld Sighting)

Cianwood's internal walls and buoys create a maze. The Northern Plateau (Suicune sighting) is only accessible by Surfing to Row 8 to bypass the X=22 and X=19 buoy walls.

### Step-by-Step Execution Plan
1. Surf to the buoy gap at (23, 15). <- CURRENT TASK
2. Surf North to the open channel at Row 8.
3. Surf West to (18, 8), bypassing the X=22 and X=19 walls.
4. Surf South to (18, 11), then West to land on the plateau at (16, 11).
5. Walk to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune sighting.

## Navigation: Buoy Gaps & Walls
- X=22 Wall: Blocked Row 9-15. Gaps at Row 8 and Row 16+.
- X=19 Wall: Blocked Row 15-20. Gaps at Row 14- and Row 21+.
- Row 15 Buoy Line: Blocked X=18-22. Gap at (23, 15).
- Row 8 Channel: Clear from X=29 down to at least X=18.

## Tile Mechanics: Cianwood City
- FLOOR: Standard traversable ground.
- WALL: Standard impassable barrier.
- WATER: Traversable only with Surf HM.
- BUOY: Impassable water barrier.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable from the North side (e.g., at (16, 10)).

## Failed Hypotheses & Lessons
- Great Sea Bypass (Route 40): Dead end on the West.
- Southern Crossing (Row 48/51): Blocked by multiple 'FLOOR_UP_WALL' lines.
- Inner Channel South: Blocked at Row 15 by a solid buoy/wall line.

## Inventory Check
- Super Repel: 5 remaining. Last applied turn 49278. (~190 steps remaining).

## Battle Strategy: Eusine
- Lead: Calcifer (Lv 64 Typhlosion).
- Strategy: Sweep with Flamethrower.
