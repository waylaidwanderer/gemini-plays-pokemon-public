# Strategy: Gym Leader Clair (REVISED)
- Status: Whited out Turn 29510. Money: ¥9042 (after selling Protein). Inventory: 3 Full Heals.
- Battle Strategy (Analyst Turn 29611):
  1. Lead Calcifer (Lv47). Use RETURN or THUNDERPUNCH vs Dragonairs. Avoid Flame Wheel.
  2. Use FULL HEALS immediately if paralyzed.
  3. GNEISS (Lv45) can switch in against the Thunderbolt Dragonair to use EARTHQUAKE.
  4. Vs Kingdra: Calcifer uses SMOKESCREEN 2-3 times first. Then chip with THUNDERPUNCH.
  5. If Kingdra charges Hyper Beam, switch to GNEISS to tank, then retaliate with EARTHQUAKE.
  6. Keep HP > 50% with Hyper Potions.
