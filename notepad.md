# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) in Cianwood City to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The Great Northern Buoy Loop (Route 41)
- Plan:
  1. Walk to (27, 44) and Surf. [IN PROGRESS]
  2. Exit East to Route 41 at (29, 44).
  3. Navigate North on Route 41 to (0, 6).
  4. Re-enter Cianwood City at (29, 6).
  5. Navigate West through gaps at (26, 6) and (22, 6) to (19, 6).
  6. Navigate South to (19, 11).
  7. Land at (16, 11) and walk to (14, 10).
- Reasoning: Row 15 is an impassable land barrier (ledge/walls). The buoy walls at X=26 and X=22 seal the northern channel from the south. Gaps at Row 6 on Route 41 provide the only verified entrance to the northern plateau pocket.

# Blocked Routes (Verified)
- Land Access: Blocked by Row 15 ledge (10, 15) and walls (12-17, 15).
- Water Access (South): Blocked by Row 15 buoy wall (18-22, 15).

# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard ground. Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Surf required. Traversable.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable cliff face.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
