## Navigation & Mechanics
- **Current Position:** `(3, 2)`.
- **Immediate Goal:** Navigate East to `(11, 1)` to check for Boulder 3.
- **Bag Status:** Full.
- Observation: Blockage at (9, 10) was a wild encounter, not a boulder.
- Status: Systematic Search (SW Corner). Turn: 17443.
    - Boulder 1: Not found at (18, 12), (17, 7).
    - Boulder 2: Not found at (5, 6), (5, 7).
    - Boulder 3: Not found at (11, 5).
    - Boulder 4: Not found at (9, 10) (Verified Empty).
    - Checking (5, 13) next.
- Goal: Locate boulders and push to pits.
    - Plan:
    1. Navigate to (5, 13) to check final SW area.
    2. If NO boulders found on B1F:
       - The puzzle might be in a weird state.
       - Option A: Fall down a pit to check B2F (lower section of this map?).
       - Option B: Use ladder to leave and re-enter to force respawn.
- Note: Objects list is empty. Strong suspicion of puzzle state issue or already solved?
- Pits: `(11, 2)`, `(4, 7)`, `(5, 12)`, `(12, 13)` (Open).
