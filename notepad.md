Sequence: B(x2) -> Start -> Reset Main (Up x6) -> POKEMON (Down) -> A -> Reset Party (Up x5) -> Icarus (Down x5) -> A -> Reset Sub-menu (Up x4) -> A (FLY) -> sleep -> Left x16 -> A -> sleep -> A -> sleep -> A. Total Fly failures: 22. Current Turn: #51048. Goal: Cianwood (14, 10). Prep: Calcifer in lead. Focus: SUICUNE sighting.
