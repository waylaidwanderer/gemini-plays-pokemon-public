# Kanto Campaign Status
- **Location:** Cerulean Pokemon Center.
- **Current Objective:** Reach the Power Plant via Route 9.
- **Location:** Cerulean Gym.
- **Immediate Task:** Navigate to the central platform (4, 3) to inspect the pool and back area.
- **Lore:** The Rocket Grunt event likely requires visiting the Power Plant first.
- **Strategy:** Quick visual sweep of the Gym. If empty, exit and head North to Route 24 to find the path to the Power Plant (since the South path was blocked).
- **Note:** I have SURF (Gyarados/Poliwag) if needed to cross the water.
