# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Verified Strategy: Land-Based Exploration
The northern plateau (14, 10) must be reached via the internal land mass of Cianwood. The Route 41 detour is blocked by buoys at Row 50.

### Execution Plan
1. Return to Cianwood: Enter Cianwood City (Map 22_3) from Route 41 at (29, 45). (In Progress)
2. Wall Bypass: Walk North to Row 27, West to Column 16, and South/West to reach the central land mass.
3. Ledge Gap: Navigate to the gap in the northern ledges at (11, 15).
4. Plateau Ascent: Walk North from (11, 15) to Row 14, then East and North to reach Suicune at (14, 10).

## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard land (Traversable).
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way North (Allows Ascent, Blocks Descent). Verification needed for horizontal movement.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way South (Allows Descent, Blocks Ascent).
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Requires Surf.
- BUOY: Impassable water barrier.

## Battle Plan: Eusine
