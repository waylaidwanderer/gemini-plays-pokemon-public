# Gem's Gameplay Log

## Party Status
*   **SPROUT** (Oddish, Lv10): My main attacker for Brock. Needs to reach Lv12.
*   **PIP** (Pidgey, Lv10): Backup, good for Sand-Attack utility.
*   **SPARKY** (Pikachu, Lv12): At level cap. Strong, but will be on standby for now.

## Current Goals
1.  **[Primary]** Defeat Brock in Pewter City.
2.  **[Secondary]** Train SPROUT to the level cap (12).
3.  **[Tertiary]** Explore any remaining unseen areas I come across.

## Strategic Notes & Hypotheses
*   **Brock Strategy:** Rely on SPROUT. Its typing should be advantageous against Rock types. *Crucial dependency: SPROUT learning a Grass-type damaging move.*
*   **Training Plan:** Currently heading to Route 22 to grind levels for SPROUT and PIP.
*   **Hard Mode Rules:** Set mode, no items in battle, level caps are strict.
*   **Pathing Issues:** Encountered several blockages in Viridian City. Need to be more careful planning routes and observing the map memory.

## Key Discoveries
*   **Defeated Trainers:** Bug Catcher (Viridian Forest, (31,34)), Cooltrainer F (Viridian Forest, (3,42)), Bug Catcher (Viridian Forest, (3,19)), Rival BLAZe (Route 22, (30,5)).
*   **NPCs:** Old Man who blocked Route 2 is gone. Girl at (18,10) needs coffee for her grandpa. Gambler at (31,9) has repetitive dialogue.
*   **Verified Mechanics:** Ghost > Psychic, Poison > Bug.
