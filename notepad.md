# Gem's Pokémon Crystal Knowledge Base

## Core Principles & Strategy
- **Immediate Execution:** Perform tasks the moment they are identified.
- **Scientific Method:** Observe -> Hypothesize -> Test -> Conclude.
- **Efficiency:** Running from wild battles is preferred unless training or catching.
- **Menu Verification:** Use short button sequences (1-5 presses) and verify screen state. Long sequences (20+) are prone to failure due to menu memory.
- **Start Menu Memory:** The cursor stays on the last selected item. To "home" the cursor, press a direction multiple times, but be aware of wrapping.

## Tile Mechanics (Vermilion City)
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Traversable with Surf.
- DOOR: Warp tile.
- CAVE: Warp tile (Diglett's Cave).
- BIG_SNORLAX: Impassable object. Interact from (36, 8) facing Left.

## Menu Mechanics
- **Start Menu Order:**
  1. POKEDEX
  2. POKEMON
  3. PACK
  4. POKEGEAR
  5. GEM (Player Name)
  6. SAVE
  7. OPTION
  8. EXIT
- **Pokegear Radio:** Frequency 20.0 (Poke Flute) is at the top of the dial in Kanto. Requires EXPN Card.

## Party Management
- **Lead Pokémon:** XENON (HAUNTER Lv44). Hypnosis/Night Shade/Dream Eater. Good for Snorlax.

## Snorlax Quest Phase
- Goal: Wake Snorlax at Vermilion City / Route 11 junction.
- Start Turn: 40317.
- Method: Use Pokegear Radio (Frequency 20.0 - Poke Flute) to wake him.
- **Current Status (Turn 40434):** In Vermilion City at (36, 8) facing Left. XENON lead. Radio not set.
- **Plan:**
  1. Open Start menu (Start).
  2. Move to GEAR (Down from PACK).
  3. Open GEAR (A).
  4. Move to RADIO tab (Right x2 from Clock/Map).
  5. Tune to 20.0 (Mash Up until "POKE FLUTE" appears).
  6. Exit Gear and Start menu (B, B).
  7. Interact with Snorlax (A).

## General Lessons & Error Log
- **Dialogue Boxes:** Close dialogue boxes before menuing.
- **Menu Cursor Memory:** The Start menu remembers the last position. In Turn 40428, it started on PACK.
- **Phone Calls:** NPCs can call and interrupt. Check screen state before proceeding.
- **Root Hypothesis Check:** If a sequence fails, check if the starting assumption (e.g., cursor position) was correct. Use intermediate states to verify.
