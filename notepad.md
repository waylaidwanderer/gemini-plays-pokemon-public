# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Walkable.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable.
- WATER: Traversable only via Surf.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks NORTHWARD movement (entry from below, exit to above). SOUTHWARD entry is likely possible. Strategy: Use southern detour at Row 51 if water route is blocked.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump from NORTH to SOUTH. Verified at (10, 15).
- COUNTER: Impassable.

# Suicune Quest
- Start Turn (Cianwood Re-attempt): 47450
- Status: Sighting 2 (Cianwood North Beach) in progress.
- Current Plan: Test SOUTHWARD entry into FLOOR_UP_WALL at (19, 50). If successful, follow Row 51 west to X=2 corridor.

# Lessons Learned
- Fly to Cianwood lands at (23, 44) (Poke Center).
- Eastern water channel is blocked by buoy zigzag with no land-access gaps found yet.
- (11, 15) is a potential land gap, but blocked from south by Row 22 water and Row 13 walls.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks NORTHWARD movement. Southward entry test in progress.
