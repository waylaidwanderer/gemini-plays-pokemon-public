- Insight: "Facing: up" in GameState confirms alignment issue. Menu usage failed because of this.
- Plan: Close All Menus (B, B), Face DOWN (Down), then Restart Menu Sequence.
- Requirement: Must face BUOY/Whirlpool to use HM.
- Status: At (24, 22). Facing UP (Incorrect).
- Error: "Can't use that here" triggered because I was facing UP, away from the Whirlpool.
- Correction: Must close menus, face DOWN, then interact.
- Action: B (Close Text) -> B (Exit Menu) -> B (Exit Start) -> Down (Face Whirlpool) -> A (Interact).
- Whirlpool Location: (24, 23).
- Badge Check: Have Glacier Badge (Pryce) -> Can use Whirlpool.
