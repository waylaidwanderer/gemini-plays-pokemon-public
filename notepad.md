## Active Quest: Find Granddaughter
- Started: Turn 37715. Timestamp: Friday, January 9, 2026 at 5:17 PM PST.
- Status: Investigating B1F. Sailor at (31, 6) blocks the eastern corridor.
- Strategy: Bypass sailor at (31, 6) by moving through (30, 7) -> (30, 6) -> (30, 5). Reach western side via gaps at y=5.
- Target: Explore western corridor at x=28. Super Nerd at (26, 9) blocks the corridor at x=26.
- Clues: Gentleman (2, 17) on 1F says she's energetic. Sailor at (31, 6) was looking for "lazy bum" buddy. Found buddy at (30, 6). Both sailors now on duty.

## Kanto Strategy

- NPCs may block corridors until specific events/dialogue.
- NPCs update positions after a map transition.
- Super Nerd at (26, 9) acts as a wall and blocks the corridor at x=26.
