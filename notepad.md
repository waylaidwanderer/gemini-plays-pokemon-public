# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
- **Start Turn:** 49885
- **Current Status:** Executing the "Gem Corridor" (X=6) route to bypass central walls.

## Active Strategy: The Gem Corridor (X=6)
The northern plateau (14, 10) is accessible via a clear north-south corridor along the X=6 column, which leads to the western terrace system.

### Execution Plan
1. Central Terrace: Walk North from (6, 33) to Row 18. (In Progress)
2. West Coast Entry: Walk West to X=4, then North to Row 14.
3. Plateau Access: Walk East along Row 14 to (8, 14), then North to Row 12.
4. Final Approach: Walk East along Row 12 to (14, 12) and North to Suicune at (14, 10).

## Verified Mechanics
- X=6: A clear north-south land corridor from Row 33 to Row 18.
- X=4: A clear north-south land corridor from Row 18 to Row 14.
- Row 14: Clear horizontal path from X=4 to X=8.
- Row 12: Clear horizontal path from X=8 to X=14.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks DOWN movement (e.g., Row 50; 6, 34). Moving UP is allowed.

## Battle Plan: Eusine
- Expected Team: Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25).
- Lead: Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion).
- Strategy: Flamethrower sweep. Overleveled status ensures OHKOs.

## Failed Hypotheses
- Hypothesis 1: Land access via X=2 or X=11. Result: Blocked by ledges/rocks.
- Hypothesis 2: Direct Surf to beach. Result: Beach is a dead end.
- Hypothesis 3: Cut tree at (11, 13). Result: Tree is a solid wall.
- Hypothesis 4: Southern loop via Row 51. Result: Blocked by Row 50 ledges.
