# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Reach the West Whirlpool (15, 23) via the Central Channel (Row 14, Col 16).

# Current Status (Turn 18326)
- **Location:** Dragon's Den B1F (14, 22).
- **Action:** Navigate to the TRUE West Whirlpool at (10, 20).
- **Reasoning:** 
    - My previous interaction confirmed (15, 23) is just a Buoy.
    - Re-examining the Mental Map reveals the tile at **(10, 20)** has the specific type `WHIRLPOOL`.
    - I must navigate North to Row 10, then West to Column 10, then South to reach it.
- **Goal:** Reach (10, 19) and interact with the Whirlpool at (10, 20).

# Plan
1. Navigate to (10, 19) via (14, 10) -> (10, 10).
2. Interact with Whirlpool at (10, 20).
3. Enter the inner area.
