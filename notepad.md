  - Verified in-game; ignore external advice.
- **Elm's Lab PC (3, 5):** Contains research notes ("OBSERVATIONS ON POKéMON EVOLUTION"); no storage access.
- **Menu Verification:** Always cross-reference "Current Screen Text" and "Text History" before executing menu navigation.
- **Nicknaming:** Successfully nicknamed the contest Scyther "GLAIVE". [Turn 35852]
