# Tile Mechanics
- **WALL:** Impassable.
- **FLOOR:** Walkable.
- **WARP_CARPET_DOWN:** Exits map (requires entering from North?).
- **LADDER:** Changes floor.

# Objectives & Progress
- **Primary:** Rescue the Director (held in Underground Warehouse).
- **Current Task:** Access the Southeast Underground section to find Switch 2 & 3.
- **Key Item:** BASEMENT KEY (Obtained).

# Strategy: The "Dept Store" Hypothesis
- **Observation:** The East Tunnel in the Underground dead-ends at Row 10. The West Ladder (3, 34) leads to a dead-end room.
- **Hypothesis:** The Southeast section of the Underground (containing the remaining switches) is NOT accessible from the Main Tunnel. It is likely accessed via the **Department Store Basement**, which had a locked door I couldn't open earlier.
- **Plan:**
    1. Exit Goldenrod Underground (North).
    2. Go to Goldenrod Department Store.
    3. Descend to the Basement.
    4. Use BASEMENT KEY to unlock the door and access the new area.

# Completed Notes (Archive)
- **Rival Battle:** Defeated Silver (Golbat, Haunter, Feraligatr, Sneasel, Magnemite). Muscle (Machoke) swept.
- **Switch 1:** Found at (16, 1) via Ladder at (22, 27). Turned ON. Did not open the main shutter.
- **Exploration:** Checked Warehouse Room (Map 3_53). North wall shutters are closed. West/Southwest ladders explore.

# Important Locations
- **Switch 1:** Map 3_54 (via 3_53 ladder). ON.
- **Director:** Warehouse (locked behind shutters).
- **Dept Store Basement:** Likely route to switches.
