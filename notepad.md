# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Verified Strategy: The Terrace Climb
The northern plateau (14, 10) is accessible via a series of one-way upward transitions that bypass the ledge system. This is a land route requiring a detour to the southern part of the city.

### Verified Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way North. Blocks South movement (Verified at (6, 46) on Turn 50198).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way South. Blocks North movement.
- Route 41 Buoys: Row 50 (0-2) and Row 51 (2-5) block direct southern access. A detour around Row 52+ may be required.

### Execution Plan
1. Route 41 Detour: Surf to Route 41 and navigate to the southern entrance of Cianwood (Row 51+). (In Progress)
2. Southern Re-entry: Enter Cianwood City (Map 22_3) from Route 41 at (0, 51).
3. Terrace Ascent: From the southern beach, follow the sequence of upward transitions:
   - Climb 1: (6, 46)
   - Climb 2: (6, 34)
   - Climb 3: (4, 30)
   - Climb 4: (4, 20)
4. Trigger Suicune: Reach (14, 10) to initiate the event.
