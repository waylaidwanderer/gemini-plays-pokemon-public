# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Standard walkable ground.
- WATER: Traversable only via Surf.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- WALL: Impassable obstacle.

# Suicune Capture Strategy
- Start Turn: 47680
- Lead: XENON (Haunter, Lv44).
- Move 1: Hypnosis (Sleep).
- Move 2: Night Shade (44 dmg). Suicune has ~120 HP. Use twice for Red health.
- Item: Ultra Balls (32).
- Note: Suicune is Water type. Calcifer (Fire) is vulnerable. GORP (Snorlax) is a good tank.

# Strategic Plans: Locate Suicune
## The 'Beach Shortcut' (New Primary Route)
- Hypothesis: The northern plateau is inaccessible from the water. The intended path is walking North along the West beach at X=2.
- Access Point: A 6-tile wide gap in the internal city walls at X=5, Y=46-51.
- Route:
  1. Land at (19, 30) (East Coast Surf Point). [Completed Turn 48086]
  2. Walk West through the gap at (5, 47) to reach the beach.
  3. Walk North along the sand (X=2) to Y=10.
  4. Walk East to Suicune at (14, 10).
- Status: Executing landing and trek.

## Failed Hypotheses
- The Great Spiral: Blocked by solid buoy/wall barriers at Y=9 and Y=15. (1 attempt).
- Gem Shortcut (11, 15): Confirmed 1x1 dead-end pocket. Marker 🚫 placed.

# Reflection Turn 48086
- Lesson: The buoy maze is likely a deterrent or a late-game path. The southern wall gap is a much more promising access point for early plateau exploration.
- Goal Status: Landed in Cianwood. Transitioning to land navigation.
- Verification: Analyst claims 1 tap = 1 city in Fly menu, but list scrolling (Up/Down) was verified as the correct method. 2D coordinate/grid theories were falsified.
