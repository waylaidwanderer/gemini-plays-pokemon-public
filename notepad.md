## Global Game Mechanics
### General Mechanics
- **Physics:** Boulders cannot push other boulders. You must occupy the tile 'behind' a boulder to push it.
- **'Scoot' Mechanic:** Leaving and re-entering a map refreshes map state (e.g., moving NPCs).
- **Warp Verification:** Game State 'Warps' list is the source of truth.
- **Key Items:** Passive upgrades (e.g., Radio Card) may not list in inventory.
- **path:** Harness Feature. Automatically moves along the `path_plan` coordinate list. NOT a custom tool.

### Pokegear & Radio Systems
- **Menu Layout:** Horizontal ROW [BACK | MAP | PHONE | RADIO]. Navigation wraps/clamps. 'B' exits to Overworld.
- **Navigation:** Blind inputs unreliable. Reliable path to Radio: Reset to BACK (Left x3), then RADIO (Right x3). Use `force_press_button`.
- **Radio Tuning:** 'A' toggles Manual/Preset. 'Up/Down' cycles presets. 'Right' moves needle manually. Tune to 20.0 for Poké Flute.
- **Interruption Mechanics:** Receiving a phone call ABSOLUTELY resets the radio frequency to default. Must retune to 20.0 after every call before interacting with Snorlax.
- **Start Menu:**
  - **Order:** Pokedex, Pokemon, Pack, Pokegear (4th), Status, Save, Option, Exit.
  - **Cursor Memory:** Remembers last selection. Fix: Force cursor to top (Up x5) before navigating.
- **UI Mixed State:** Pokegear menu header can persist over text boxes. Press 'B' aggressively to clear.

### Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR:** Walkable.
- **WALL:** Impassable.
- **WINDOW:** Impassable Wall.
- **PIT / HOLE:** Traversable warp.
- **ICE:** Slippery. Slide until hitting a wall or non-ice tile.
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN:** One-way jump South.
- **TALL_GRASS:** Walkable (Wild Encounters).
- **WATER:** Traversable (Surf required).
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Context Dependent. Verified TRAVERSABLE on Victory Road (3_91) at (13, 38). IMPASSABLE in Dragon's Den B1F, Route 10 North, Route 9, Diglett's Cave (3_84) at (12, 24), and Route 3 (18, 12).
- **FLOOR_LEFT_WALL:** Directional Wall. Blocks movement to the LEFT. Verified on Celadon Mansion Roof.
- **FLOOR_RIGHT_WALL:** Directional Wall. Blocks movement to the RIGHT. Verified on Celadon Mansion Roof.
- **LEDGE_HOP_LEFT:** One-way jump Left. Acts as a reset on Map 3_64.
- **LEDGE_HOP_RIGHT:** One-way jump Right.
- **ROCK:** Breakable (Rock Smash).
- **BOULDER:** Pushable (Strength).
- **CUT_TREE:** Obstacle. Removable (Cut).
- **WARP_CARPET:** Walk off map to exit.
- **LADDER:** Context Dependent. Usually a warp, but verified as a walkable bridge (FLOOR behavior) on Cerulean Gym (7_6) and Route 24 (7_15).
- **WARP_CARPET_DOWN:** Walk Down to warp.
- **STAIRCASE:** Traversable warp.
- **COUNTER:** Impassable. Allows interaction with Entity on other side.
- **WATER/LAND Interaction:** Moving from Water to Land triggers 'Want to get off?'. Cancel with B to face Land. Moving from Land to Water triggers 'Want to Surf?'. Both prompts override hidden item checks.
- **STATUE:** Interactable. Stand BELOW, face UP, press A.
- **BOOKSHELF:** Impassable Obstacle.
- **Map Markers:** Use simple emojis (e.g., ⭐) to prevent errors.

### Battle Mechanics
- **Switch Prompt:** Defaults to YES. Press B to decline safely.
- **Accuracy Debuffs:** Effective vs strong opponents (e.g. Smokescreen).
- **Type Effectiveness:** Fire is 0.5x effective against Water/Ground (not 0.25x).
- **Weather:** Rain Dance reduces Fire-type damage by 50%.

## Strategy Notes
- **Surfing:** Pathfinding must strictly separate Land/Water.
- **Team:** Paprika (Lead), Basalt (Backup).

## Johto History
- **Cleared:** National Park, Cianwood, Mahogany, Goldenrod, Rocket Base, Ice Path, Blackthorn.
- **Key Items:** HM06 (Whirlpool), Rising Badge, Dratini.
- **Tin Tower:** Paused. Need Rainbow Wing (Catch Raikou, Entei, Suicune).

## Lessons Learned
- **Item Verification:** Passive upgrades (e.g., Radio Card) often don't appear in the inventory; trust NPC dialogue.
- **Tool Usage:** `find_path` outputs a coordinate list for `path_plan`. Do NOT use `autopress_buttons: true` with it.
- **Menu Navigation:** Blind menu macros are unreliable due to wrapping and cursor memory. Always use `navigate_menu` or visual feedback tools.

## Route 10 North
- **Split Layout:** The map is divided into two isolated sections by a vertical wall at x=3 and a horizontal barrier of FLOOR_UP_WALL tiles at y=4.
- **East Section:** Accessed from Route 9 (East). Contains PokeCenter. Dead end.
- **West Section:** Contains Rock Tunnel. Must be accessed from the western side of Route 9.

## Route 8
- **Status:** Exploring East towards Lavender.
- **Obstacles:**
  - Biker Gang blocking x=10 (Rows 8-10). Bypass: North (Row 6).
  - Cut Tree at (21, 12).
- **Points of Interest:**
  - Locked Door at (10, 5).
  - Underground Path Sign at (11, 7).
- **Tool Usage:** Multiple tool calls in one turn overwrite each other's button outputs. Use `run_code` or a custom tool to chain multiple distinct button actions.
- **Tool Limitations:** `run_code` cannot use `autopress_buttons: true`. To execute complex button sequences, define a custom tool.
- **Sprite Reliability:** Overworld sprites can be misleading (e.g., Firebreather using Fisher sprite). Always trust the battle intro text for accurate trainer identification.
