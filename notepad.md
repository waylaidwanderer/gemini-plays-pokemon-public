# Suicune Quest
- Objective: Trigger sighting in Cianwood City at the northern shore.
- Strategy: The Great Northern Sea Loop
    1. Walk East to (19, 30).
    2. Surf East to (27, 30).
    3. Surf North to (27, 8).
    4. Surf West along Row 8 to (19, 8).
    5. Surf South to (19, 11).
    6. Surf West to (17, 11) and land at (16, 11).
    7. Walk to (7, 4) to trigger sighting.
- Note: Internal land routes are blocked. The buoy wall at Row 9/Row 15 has a verified opening at X=27.
- Suicune sighting count = 1.

# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard walkable ground.
- WATER: Traversable only while Surfing (requires HM03).
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- WALL: Impassable obstacle.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL / LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: In Cianwood, these function as standard WALL tiles from the north (cannot jump down).
- Interaction: To Surf, face WATER from an adjacent FLOOR tile and press A. Stepping onto FLOOR from WATER automatically ends Surfing.

# Lessons Learned
- Cianwood's ledges are impassable from the north.
- Internal walls divide the city into inaccessible strips on land.
- Zig-zag buoy lines block the eastern sea. Use the far eastern channel (X=27) for the loop.
- Reveal 'unseen' tiles manually before planning long routes.
