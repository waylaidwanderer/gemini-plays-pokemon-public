# I. Game Mechanics & Discoveries

## A. Verified Tile Mechanics
- **Ground:** Standard walkable tile.
- **Impassable:** Walls, objects, etc. Cannot be entered.
- **Grass:** Tall grass for wild Pokémon encounters.
- **Ledge:** Can be jumped down (one-way). Moving down into a ledge tile moves the player two tiles down.
- **Cuttable Tree:** Requires HM Cut to pass. Becomes `ground` after cutting, but respawns on map change.
- **Water:** Requires HM Surf to traverse. To use Surf from a land tile, you must be standing on a 'ground', 'water', or 'steps' tile adjacent to water, face the water, and use the HM from the party menu.
- **Boulder:** Requires HM Strength to move.
- **Hole:** Warps player to a lower floor or a specific spot on the same/different floor.
- **Ladder (Up/Down):** Warps player between floors.
- **Warp:** An instant transition point between maps or areas within a map.
- **Steps:** Allows vertical and horizontal movement between 'steps' and adjacent 'ground' or 'elevated_ground' tiles.
- **Spinner (up, down, left, right):** Forces movement in a specific direction.
- **Spinner Stop:** A tile that halts movement from a spinner.
- **Elevated Ground:** Walkable ground at a different elevation. Movement between `elevated_ground` and `ground` is only possible via `steps`.
- **Gate (`gate_offscreen`, `closed_gate`, `open_gate`):** Barriers that may open or close based on game events. `gate_offscreen` is treated as open for pathfinding.

## B. General Heuristics & Rules
- **PC Interaction:** To use a PC, stand on the tile directly below it, face up, and press 'A'.
- **HM Usage:** HMs are used from the party menu outside of battle. Fainted Pokémon can use field moves.
- **"No Will to Fight" Message (Correction):** This message appears only when the cursor in the party menu is on an already fainted Pokémon. It is a UI error, not a gameplay mechanic.
- **Trust the Data:** I incorrectly concluded the western 1F platform was a dead end. The system critique revealed other reachable warps were available. I must always trust the `navigable_warps` data over my visual assessment of the map.

# III. Puzzles & Exploration

## A. Solved Puzzles
- **Seafoam Islands B3F Water Current:** The strong water current on B3F is disabled by solving a boulder puzzle on the western side of B3F.

## B. Future Development Ideas
- **Puzzle Identifier Agent:** Create an agent that parses the `map_xml_string` to automatically identify puzzles (like boulder/switch combos or spinner mazes) and output their key coordinates. This would streamline using solver tools.
