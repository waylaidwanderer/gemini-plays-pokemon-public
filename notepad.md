# Completed Missions
- **Radio Tower:** Defeated Team Rocket, rescued Director, got Clear Bell (for Tin Tower).

# Suicune Analysis (The Target)
- **Level:** 40
- **Moves:** Bubblebeam (Water), Gust (Flying, Phys), Leer, Rain Dance.
- **Stats:** High Def/Sp.Def. Fast.
- **Catch Strategy:**
    1.  **Status:** MUST HAVE Sleep (Hypnosis/Sleep Powder) or Paralysis. (Lapis has Hypnosis but is Lv 12).
    2.  **HP:** False Swipe (if available) or careful chipping.
    3.  **Balls:** Great Balls (Stock 3 -> Buy 20+).
    4.  **Tank:** Muscle (Machoke) is good but takes heavy damage from Gust due to low Sp.Def/Def drops? Wait, Gust is Physical in Gen 2. Machoke has decent Def. The Def drops from Leer were the killer. X Defend could counter this.
