# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement (acting as a ledge). Passable from SOUTH to NORTH.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at Row 15 (X=3-17).
- ROCK: Smashable rocks act as WALLs.
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
## Strategy: The Sea Route (East Bypass)
Reach (14, 10) by surfing around the internal maze via the eastern sea.
1. Surf North to Row 8.
2. Surf West to X=19 (passing buoy gap at X=22).
3. Surf South to Row 11 and West to land at (16, 11).
4. Move North over ledge at (16, 10) to (14, 10).

# Progress Notes
- Blocked: All land routes (X=12, X=6, X=4) are blocked by internal walls or FLOOR_UP_WALL ledges.
- Verified: Row 8-6 have gaps in the X=22 buoy wall.
- Verified: (16, 11) is a landing point on the northern plateau.
- Verified: (16, 10) is a FLOOR_UP_WALL ledge that allows passage NORTH to Suicune.
