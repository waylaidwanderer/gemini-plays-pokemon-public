# Persistent Knowledge
## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- LADDER: Floor change (e.g. 1F to B1F).
- COUNTER: Face and press A to interact.
- LEDGE: Semi-traversable (jump down).

## Active Quest: Find Granddaughter
- Clues: Granddaughter is likely with the Captain.
- Strategy: Explore the cabins on 1F to find the 'lazy bum' buddy.
- Attempt 1: Caught sailor at (30, 6) goofing off (B1F). Buddy at (31, 6) still blocks path.
- Hypothesis: Catching the first sailor wasn't enough; must find the buddy on 1F or kitchen to trigger them both to return to duty.

## Kanto Strategy
- Goal: Collect 8 Kanto badges.
- Target 1: Lt. Surge (Vermilion City).
- MVP: GNEISS (Graveler) Lv 51. Ground-type immunity to Electric.

## Lessons Learned
- S.S. Aqua sailors block corridors; check Game State for exact positions.
- Super Nerd (26, 9) blocks the x=26 corridor on B1F.
- Map transitions reset NPC positions and can progress scripted events.
- Path to western 1F is likely via B1F (East 1F -> East B1F -> West B1F -> West 1F).
- Finding the 'lazy bum' buddy involves talking to the sailor looking for him (31, 6) and then the buddy himself (30, 6).
