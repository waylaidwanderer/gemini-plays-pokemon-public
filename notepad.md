# Strategic Notes
## Objectives
- **Primary:** Reach Indigo Plateau (Money Farming Loop).
- **Secondary:** Defeat Elite Four.
- **Tertiary:** Hunt Roamers (Raikou/Entei) - *Paused*.

## Current Task: Enter Indigo Plateau
- **Location:** Route 23 (ID: 16_1).
- **Goal:** Enter the Indigo Plateau building.
- **Route:** Walk North to the door at (9, 5) or (10, 5).
- **Reasoning:**
  - Successfully navigated Victory Road!
  - Route 23 is the final path to the Pokemon League.

## Reflection (Turn 33014)
- **Victory Road:** Successfully navigated. The multiple floors were confusing, but the "U-Turn" strategy on 2F and the "East Corridor" on 3F worked.
- **Tools:** `flee_battle` was useful but simple. `navigate` worked well when not blocked by hidden ledges.
- **Next Steps:** Heal, stock up (if possible), and challenge the Elite Four.

## Status
- **Money:** ¥3294.
- **Party:** Gyarados (Lead), Lugia, Machoke, Pidgey, Oddish, Quilava.
