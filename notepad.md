# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Investigate Mahogany Town (Radio Signal).
- **Secondary Goal:** Find Lance in Mahogany Town.
- **Navigation:** Team Rocket Hideout B1F - Disable Security System.

## Quest Log
- **Lake of Rage:** Caught Red Gyarados. Met Lance.
- **Mahogany Town:** In Rocket Hideout.

## Team Management
- **Party:** Muscle (43), Garnet (28), Lapis (12), Mistral (13), Kenya (11), Belladonna (5).

## Team Rocket Hideout B1F Mechanics
- **Security:** Persian Statues are cameras.
    - Camera at (6, 1) watches Row 2.
    - Camera at (24, 5) likely watches Row 5.
    - Alarm triggers infinite battles.
- **Secret Switch:**
    - **CRITICAL DISCOVERY:** Map Data lists 'TeamRocketBaseB1FSecretSwitch' at **(19, 11)**.
    - This is the objective. No need to check random statues.
- **Navigation Plan:**
    - Currently at (14, 7).
    - Map observation: Row 8 is a wall (Tiles 6-18) with a **gap at (19, 8)**.
    - Route: Go East along Row 7 to (19, 7), then South through the gap to the switch at (19, 11).
    - Stay on Row 7 to avoid Camera at (24, 5).

## Lessons Learned
- **Check Map Data:** Always review 'Map Events -> Background Objects' for named objectives (like Switches) before searching blindly.
- **Persian Statues:** They are cameras, not necessarily switches. The switch is a separate object.
