# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) in Cianwood City to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The West Beach Highway (Verified)
- Plan:
  1. Use Super Repel. [DONE]
  2. Walk to (6, 44) via Row 44 corridor. [IN PROGRESS]
  3. Walk North to (6, 37), then West to (2, 37).
  4. Walk North along West Beach (X=2) to (2, 12).
  5. Walk East to (14, 12), then North to (14, 10).
- Status: At (23, 32) on land.
- Reasoning: The city is a vertical maze, but Row 44 is a clear horizontal artery that connects the east side to the west beach. X=2 is a clear path past all city walls and cliff faces up to the northern plateau.

# Blocked Routes (Verified)
- Central City: Vertical wall at X=9 (Rows 34-37). Cliff at Row 30.
- Plateau Access (South): Row 15 ledge at (10, 15) blocks northbound entry.
- Plateau Access (East): Row 12 wall at X=17 blocks entry from water.
- Plateau Access (West): Clear path found via X=2 (West Beach).

# General Lessons
- City Layouts: In Johto cities like Cianwood, horizontal paths (Rows) often bypass vertical blockades (Walls). Always check the full length of a Row for gaps. Row 44 and Row 12 are the key arteries here.
