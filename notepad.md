# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Walkable.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable.
- WATER: Traversable only via Surf.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks NORTHWARD movement (entry from below, exit to above). SOUTHWARD entry is likely possible. Strategy: Use southern detour at Row 51 if water route is blocked.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump from NORTH to SOUTH. Verified at (10, 15).
- COUNTER: Impassable.

# Suicune Quest
- Start Turn (Cianwood Re-attempt): 47450
- Status: Sighting 2 (Cianwood North Beach) in progress.
- Strategy: Use land route via (11, 15) gap. Water route is likely blocked by buoy walls.
- Route: Land at (19, 30) -> Walk to (12, 30) -> Walk North to (12, 16) -> West to (11, 16) -> North through (11, 15) -> North Beach (7, 4).

# Lessons Learned
- Fly to Cianwood lands at (23, 44) (Poke Center).
- Eastern water channel is blocked by buoys at Row 15 and Row 9 with no confirmed path.
- (11, 15) is a critical land gap for reaching the north of the island.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks NORTHWARD movement. Southward entry test PENDING.
