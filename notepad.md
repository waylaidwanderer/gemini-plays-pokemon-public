# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Verified Strategy: The Terrace Climb
The northern plateau (14, 10) is accessible via a series of one-way upward transitions that bypass the ledge system. This is a land route requiring a detour to the southern part of the city.

### Verified Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way North. Blocks South movement (Verified at (6, 46) on Turn 50198).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way South. Blocks North movement.

### Execution Plan
1. Southern Re-entry: Find a coordinate on Route 41 (Map 22_2) that transitions into Cianwood City (Map 22_3) south of the Row 46-49 walls.
2. Terrace Ascent: From the southern beach (approx Row 51), follow the sequence of upward transitions:
   - Climb 1: (6, 46)
   - Climb 2: (6, 34)
   - Climb 3: (4, 30)
   - Climb 4: (4, 20)
3. Trigger Suicune: Reach (14, 10) to initiate the event.
