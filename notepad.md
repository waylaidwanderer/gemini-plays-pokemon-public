# Strategy: Trigger Suicune Sighting (Started: Turn 51131, Turn 51323 - Resumed)
- City Logic: Vertical walls divide the city. The Outer Sea (X=24+) is the primary route to the north.
- Buoy Barriers: Row 15 is clear at X=23+. Row 9 is clear at X=27+.
- Execution Plan:
  1. Surf North to Row 21, then East to X=27 (The Outer Sea Highway).
  2. Surf North at X=27 to Row 8.
  3. Surf West to X=14, then South to land at (14, 11).
  4. Walk to (14, 10) for the Suicune sighting.

# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard traversable tile.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable collision.
- WATER: Traversable only while using SURF.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way passage (South only). Jump FROM ledge to tile below.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way passage (North only). Walk ONTO from south or walk North from it.
- ROCK (Object): Impassable until cleared with ROCK SMASH.
