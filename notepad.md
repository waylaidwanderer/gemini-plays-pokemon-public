# Ice Path Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Reach Blackthorn City.
- **Status:** Escaping to (13, 16) to reset.
- **Hypothesis:** The correct path is **Sliding UP from (15, 17)**.
  - Previous attempts focused on South/East.
  - The "Box" loop at the start might have an exit Upwards that I missed.
- **Plan:**
  1. Navigate to (13, 16) (Start).
  2. Heal Gyarados.
  3. Start Puzzle: (13, 17) -> Right to (15, 17).
  4. **Action:** Slide UP from (15, 17).

# Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR:** Walkable.
- **WALL:** Impassable.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Acts as a SOLID WALL at (7, 18), (14, 22), (20, 24). Likely all of Row 18 is blocked, but verifying.
- **ICE:** Slides player until collision.

# Key Log
- **Turn 16388:** Escaped ice loop to (13, 16).
- **Turn 16386:** Confirmed (30, 12) leads South.
- **Turn 16381:** Row 18 ledges confirmed impassable (at x=7).
- **Turn 16398:** Ambushed by Golbat while escaping. Gyarados critical (11 HP).
- **Immediate Action:** Flee -> Heal -> Reset to (13, 16).
- **Next Hypothesis:** Check the "Box" at the start ((13,16)-(15,17)). Is sliding UP from (15, 17) a valid move, or just a loop?
