# Lessons Learned
- Precise menu navigation is critical; verify menu state before long sequences.
- PC Storage: Parties must have space before withdrawing; always deposit first if at 6/6.
- Fly Usage: Must be outdoors to use Fly.
- Suicune (Crystal): Suicune is NOT a roamer in Crystal; it is found at Tin Tower. Route 37 is for Raikou/Entei.
- Repel Trick: Use a lead Pokémon with a level between the local wild encounters and the target legendary (e.g., Lv 19 Pidgeotto for Lv 40 Roamers on Route 37).
- Menu Order: POKEDEX, POKEMON, PACK, POKEGEAR, GEM, SAVE, OPTION, EXIT. Up from GEM is POKEGEAR.
