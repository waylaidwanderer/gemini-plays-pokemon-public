# Dept Store Basement Strategy

## Puzzle Mechanics
- **Goal:** Reach East side (Items/Ladder).
- **Hypothesis:** NPC Facing Direction triggers the gates (Boxes).
    - NPC 5 (Middle) -> Controls Row 11/12 Gates?
    - NPC 6 (Top Left) -> Controls Top Gates?
- **Rule:** Stunned NPCs do NOT change facing direction during dialogue. Must Unstun before talking.

## Current Plan
1. **Stun NPC 5** at (9, 10) to fix position.
2. **Move to (8, 10)** (Flanking position).
3. **Face Right** (Towards NPC).
4. **Unstun NPC 5**.
5. **Immediately Talk (A)** to force him to turn LEFT.
6. Check if Gate 2 (10, 12) opens.

## Status
- Player at (9, 9).
- NPC 5 at (9, 10).
- Action: Stunning and Positioning.
