# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Cross the whirlpool to reach the Dragon Shrine.

# Key Mechanics & Lessons
- **Field Moves:** If 'A' interaction fails (even when facing correctly), ALWAYS fallback to Menu -> Pokemon -> [Mon] -> [Move].
- **Whirlpool:** Requires facing the whirlpool tile directly. 'A' button might be unreliable; Menu is safer.

- Status: Correction - Facing Down to use Whirlpool.
- Reason: Game State confirms 'Facing: up', but Whirlpool is at (15, 23) (Below). Must face DOWN. 'Whirlpool' option missing from menu confirms incorrect facing/context.
- Step 1: Close all menus (B x3).
- Step 2: Face DOWN (Down).
- Step 3: Interact (A).
