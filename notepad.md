# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard ground. Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Surf required. Traversable.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- DOOR: Warp point.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable cliff face (e.g., Row 15, Row 30, Row 34).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
- BREAKABLE ROCK: Requires Rock Smash. Impassable.
- NPC: Impassable. Interact from adjacent tile.

# Blocked Routes (Verified)
- Central City: Blocked at Row 30 by a continuous cliff face.
- Buoy Maze: Extremely complex layout with walls at X=26, X=22, and X=19.

# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The West Beach Ascent
- Plan:
  1. Use Super Repel in PACK. [DONE]
  2. Navigate South to (27, 30) then West to land at (19, 30). [IN PROGRESS]
  3. Walk West to (2, 30).
  4. Walk North along the west beach to (2, 14).
  5. Walk East to (14, 10).
- Status: At (27, 18) surfing.
- Reasoning: The west beach (X=0-2) is a continuous path from the southern city to the northern plateau, bypassing all buoy mazes and cliffs. Row 30 landing at (19, 30) is the key access point.
