# Lessons Learned
- Precise menu navigation is critical during high-stakes battles. Always verify cursor position before confirming.
- Don't over-rely on a single strategy (like Rollout). Be prepared to pivot to other team members if the primary plan fails.
- Regular notepad cleanup prevents bloat and ensures strategic information is easily accessible.
- Avoid known warps during overworld navigation unless they are the intended destination.

# Legendary Hunt Strategy
- General Strategy: Lead with a fast Pokemon (Calcifer or XENON). Use Hypnosis (XENON/LAPIS) or Sleep Powder (KIMCHI) to inflict Sleep. Reduce HP with fixed-damage moves like Night Shade (XENON). Use Ultra Balls or Heavy Balls.
- Suicune: Tracks unknown.
- Raikou/Entei: Roaming Johto. Use Pokegear Map to track.

- Mewtwo: Cerulean Cave? (Verify if accessible).
