# Suicune Quest
- Start Turn (Cianwood Re-attempt): 47450
- Status: Sighting 2 (Cianwood North Beach) in progress.
- Strategy: Surf north through the eastern water channel. 
- Route: (19, 30) -> (23, 30) -> (23, 15) -> (21, 15) -> (21, 9) -> (7, 9) -> (7, 4).
- Sighting 1: Burned Tower (DONE)
- Battle Strategy: Use XENON (Haunter) for Hypnosis. Chip HP with fixed damage moves if needed.

# Lessons Learned
- (23, 46) is a FLOOR_UP_WALL, not a ledge. The 'Ledge' marker was a hallucination.
- Southern detours are blocked by one-way walls at Row 50.
- Northern land route is blocked by Row 15 wall.
- Eastern water channel has gaps in buoy walls at (23, 15) and (21, 9).
