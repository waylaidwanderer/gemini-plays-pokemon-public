# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Strategy & Pathing
- **Goal:** Reach Azalea Town (West of Route 33).
- **Current Task:** Defeat Hiker Anthony.
- **Battle Status:** Unakite Fainted. Sending out Rocky (14/28 HP).
- **Strategy:**
    1. Send out Rocky (Current Action).
    2. **Turn 1 Action:** OPEN PACK -> Use Energypowder.
       - **Reasoning:** Rocky (14 HP) vs Machop (Low Kick 150 Eff BP).
       - **Calc:** Onix High Def reduces dmg to ~11-13.
       - **Risk:** 14 HP is too close to death range. Crit = Over. High roll = Over.
       - **Play:** Heal to Full (28/28). Survive hit. Then fight.
- **Map Notes:**
    - **Route 32:** North.
    - **Union Cave 1F:** Current. Exit at (17, 31).
    - **Route 33:** South.
- **Mechanics:**
    - **Gen 2 Battle:** Items consume turn.
