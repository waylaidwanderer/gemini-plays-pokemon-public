# Suicune Quest Strategy: 'Western Beach Walk'
- Goal: Reach Suicune at (7, 4).
- Fact: The northern part of the island (north beach) is accessible by land via the far western beach (X=0 to X=2).
- Solution: Walk across the land bridge at Y=30 to the western beach, then walk north to the northern plateau.
- Route:
    1. From (19, 30), land and move to (19, 35).
    2. Move Left to (10, 35).
    3. Move Up to (10, 34) and Left to (5, 34).
    4. Move Left to (2, 34).
    5. Walk North to (2, 14).
    6. Walk East and North through the plateau: (2, 14) -> (8, 14) -> (8, 12) -> (14, 12) -> (14, 10).
    7. Approach Suicune sighting area at (7, 4).
- Preparation: Lead with XENON (Haunter) for Hypnosis. Be ready for Eusine.
- Status: At (20, 30) surfing. Clearing Tully's call.
- Failed Hypotheses:
    - 'Triple Gap Loop' (Attempts: 2): Dead end. X=26 wall is solid from Row 0-9. Row 9 wall is solid from X=22-26.
    - 'Island Bypass (Surf)' (Attempts: 1): Unnecessary. Land route is simpler.
