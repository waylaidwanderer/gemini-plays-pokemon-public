# Suicune Strategy (Crystal Version)
- Mechanics Check: In Crystal, Suicune becomes a stationary overworld encounter at Tin Tower after clearing fleeing events and defeating the Wise Trio.
- Prerequisites:
    1. Burned Tower flee event. (COMPLETED)
    2. Cianwood City overworld encounter. (COMPLETED)
    3. Route 42 middle island encounter. (COMPLETED)
    4. Defeat Wise Trio at Tin Tower Entrance building. (COMPLETED)
    5. Possess Clear Bell. (COMPLETED)
- Current Status: Suicune is in Ecruteak City (Pokedex confirmed). Stationary battle expected.
- Battle Plan: Hypnosis -> weaken. Suicune is level 40. Moves: Rain Dance, Gust, Aurora Beam, Mist.
- Team: XENON (Gastly) for Sleep, GNEISS (Graveler) for tanking.

# Tin Tower Investigation
- Hypothesis: If Suicune is not appearing on 1F despite the Clear Bell, I must re-verify the Wise Trio's defeat at the Entrance building (3_3) and check for Eusine's presence. There may be a final trigger dialogue.
- Current Task: Search Tin Tower Entrance (3_3) and Wise Trio's Room (3_5) for Eusine or missed triggers.
