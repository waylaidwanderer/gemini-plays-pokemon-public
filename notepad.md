# Strategy: Trigger Suicune Sighting (Started: Turn 51131, Turn 51301 - Resumed)
- City Logic: Vertical walls divide the city. The Western Corridor (X=0-2) is the main land route to the north, but requires a long detour to Row 51 or using Surf to bypass walls.
- Execution Plan:
  1. Walk to (23, 32) via Row 32.
  2. Use SURF at (23, 32) to enter the Outer Sea at (24, 32).
  3. Surf North to Row 11, then East to X=27 to bypass the Row 9 buoy barrier.
  4. Surf North to Row 8, then West to X=14.
  5. Land at (14, 11) and walk to (14, 10) for the Suicune sighting.

# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard traversable tile.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable collision.
- WATER: Traversable only while using SURF.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way passage (South only). Jump FROM ledge to tile below.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way passage (North only). Walk ONTO from south or walk North from it.
- ROCK (Object): Impassable until cleared with ROCK SMASH.
