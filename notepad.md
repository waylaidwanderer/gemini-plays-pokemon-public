# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Strategy: The Great Southern Loop
The northern plateau (14, 10) is accessible via the western coast highway (X=2). This requires a long loop through the southern terrace gaps.

### Execution Plan
1. Southern Descent: Navigate to (20, 51) via gaps at (10, 34), (8, 46), (12, 48), and (20, 50). (In Progress)
2. Western Crossing: Walk west along Row 51 to (4, 51).
3. Coastal Ascent: Walk north along X=4 to (4, 21), then bypass to X=2 via (4, 20) UP_WALL.
4. Final Approach: Walk north along X=2 to Row 12, then east to (14, 10).

## Global Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Land (Traversable).
- WALL, BUOY, DOOR: Impassable.
- WATER: Requires Surf.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way North. Blocks DOWN movement. (e.g. 6-8, 34; 12-19, 50).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way South. Blocks NORTH movement. (e.g. 10, 15).

## Battle Plan: Eusine
- Expected Team: Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25).
- Lead: Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion).
- Strategy: Flamethrower sweep.
