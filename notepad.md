# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Current Status
- **Location**: Cianwood City (22_9), Inside Pharmacy.
- **Goal**: Get SecretPotion.
- **Status**: Leaving Cianwood.
- **Reasoning**:
  1. Pharmacist dialogue loop implies Quest Flag is NOT active.
  2. I likely missed a trigger with Jasmine in Olivine (or the game requires Strength first?).
  3. **CRITICAL**: I NEED HM04 Strength to challenge the Cianwood Gym (Chuck).
  4. HM04 is in Olivine City (Cafe).
  5. Plan: Go back to Olivine, get Strength, re-talk to Jasmine, then return.
- **Plan**:
  1. Exit Pharmacy.
  2. Go to Mart (15, 48) to buy Repels (for the swim back).
  3. Surf back to Olivine City.
- **Revised Plan (The "Slow & Steady" Approach)**:
  1. Clear dialogue/Reset room.
  2. Talk to Pharmacist.
  3. Advance text to "...along the way?".
  4. Press 'A' *once*.
  5. **WAIT** for the next turn to visually confirm the Yes/No menu.
  6. Press 'Down'.
  7. **WAIT** to confirm cursor moved.
  8. Press 'A'.
- **Next**: Buy Repels, Surf to Olivine.

### Objectives
- **Primary**: Obtain Mineral Badge (Jasmine).
- **Secondary**: Get SecretPotion (Cianwood).
- **Tertiary**: Train Basil to Lvl 21.

### Notes
- **Cianwood Pharmacy**: Supposed to have the SecretPotion.
- **Gym**: Chuck (Fighting). Weak to Psychic/Flying. Needs Strength (HM04) to reach.
- **Plan**:
  1. Get SecretPotion (Current).
  2. Buy Repels at General Store (22_3).
  3. Surf to Olivine City.
  4. Get HM04 (Strength) from Café.
  5. Climb Lighthouse, Heal Amphy.
  6. Defeat Jasmine (Steel) with Garnet.
  7. Return to Cianwood (Surf), Defeat Chuck, get Fly.
- **Shuckle Guy**: Found at (17, 41) in Cianwood (Map 22_4). Offers a Shuckle to look after.
- **Search Update**: Building at (17, 41) is NOT the Pharmacy. Pharmacy is likely South of the Pokemon Center.
- **Discovery**: Found a previously unnoticed door at (15, 37) in Cianwood.
- **Hypothesis**: This is likely the Pharmacy.
- **Plan**: Navigate to (15, 38) and enter.
