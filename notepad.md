# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026 (Turn #12392)

### Current Task
- **Fix Glitch**: Enter Route 35 Gatehouse (3, 5) to reset the map and move the glitched girl blocking the Flower Shop.

### Quest Log
- **Badges**: Zephyr, Hive, Plain.
- **Party**: All Healthy.
- **Mail Quest**: Active.
- **Sudowoodo**: Inspected at Turn 12797.

### Strategic Notes
- **Navigation**: Currently in Goldenrod City near the Flower Shop.
- **SquirtBottle**: Need to get this to move Sudowoodo.
- **Floria**: Likely the girl outside or inside the shop.

### Tile Types
- **TYPE_3fe2**: Walkable Ground/Grass (Safe)
- **TYPE_2889**: Obstacle (Wall/Tree)
- **TYPE_fed7**: Mixed (Benches/Obstacles & Gaps).
- **Navigation Constraint**: Route 35 East is separated from Goldenrod Gatehouse by a fence.
- Tool: `type_text` active. Layout verified (9 cols).
- Status Update: Obtained SquirtBottle!
- Immediate Plan:
  1. Travel to Azalea Town to buy Poké Balls (Goldenrod Dept Store 2F clerks are bugged/missing).
  2. Return to Route 36 to catch Sudowoodo.

- Warning: The clerks at Goldenrod Dept Store 2F seem to be missing or inactive (interacting yields shelf text). Checking the wandering NPC.
- Contingency: If Goldenrod Dept Store clerks are missing/inactive on 2F, travel to Azalea Town Mart to buy Poké Balls before heading to Route 36.
