# Suicune Event State
- **Status:** Suicune missing from (9,9).
- **Global Flag:** "The TIN TOWER shook!" (Confirmed).
- **Local State:** 
    - Wise Trio Room (4_2): EMPTY. Sages Gaku, Masa, Koji are GONE.
    - Tin Tower 1F: Sages present but give generic lore. Suicune missing from (9,9).
- Warp Tile at (10,2): Previously inactive. Retesting now that "Tower Shook" flag is active.
- **Hypothesis:** The disappearance of the Sages from 4_2 is the trigger. They have likely moved to Tin Tower or the path is now open.

# Current Mission
- **Goal:** Catch Suicune / Find Eusine.
- **Immediate Action:** Go to Tin Tower Yard -> Tin Tower 1F.
- **Expectation:** Eusine or the Sages should be there, or the path forward (Clear Bell?) is active.

# Reference
- **Barrier Station:** 
    - Ladder (17,3) -> Wise Trio Room (4_2).
    - Ladder (5,3) -> (17,15) loop (Anomaly).
- **Tin Tower Exit:** From (37,9) navigate maze to (20,3).
- Cooltrainer F (PC) gave generic Morty dialogue.
- Plan: Check Burned Tower for Eusine.
- Received phone call from Wade (Bug Catcher). Generic chatter about Caterpie growing fast.
- Resuming path to Burned Tower to find Eusine.
- Burned Tower 1F: Eusine NOT at entrance (9,14).
- Plan: Checking center of room (9,9) and B1F Ladder (7,15).
- Eusine is NOT at the Burned Tower entrance (9,14).
- Proceeding to check the center of the room (9,9).
- Eusine is NOT at the center of Burned Tower 1F (9,9).
- Plan: Falling down the pit at (10,9) to search B1F for Eusine.
- Location: Burned Tower B1F.
- Status: Searching for Eusine at the Beast Awakening spot (North Center).
- Note: If he's not here, Suicune might have reset to a roaming state, or I need to check the Wise Trio again (thoroughly).
- Eusine is NOT at the B1F platform (10,5).
- Action: Taking warp at (10,8) to exit the B1F pit area.
- Next Search Area: Wise Trio Room (Barrier Station) or re-check Ecruteak City.
- Warp at (10, 8) in Burned Tower B1F failed to trigger.
- Plan: Exiting B1F via Ladder at (7, 15).
- Next: Check Wise Trio Room (Barrier Station) again. I checked it BEFORE the Wandering Sage confirmed the shake. Maybe Eusine is there now.
- Searched Burned Tower B1F. Eusine not found.
- Exited to Ecruteak City.
- Heading to Barrier Station (Wise Trio Room) to check for Eusine/Sages again.
- Returning to Wise Trio Room via Ladder at (5,3).
- Hypothesis: Eusine might have spawned here after the "Tower Shook" flag was set.
- Anomaly: Ladder at (5,3) warped me to (17,15) on the same map (4_1).
- Hypothesis: I might have bypassed the Wise Trio Room (4_2) or the connection is non-standard.
- Action: Taking Ladder at (17,3) to see if it leads to 4_2 or the Tin Tower trail.
- Confirmed: Ladder at (17,3) in Barrier Station (Trail Side) leads to Wise Trio Room (4_2).
- Confirmed: City Side Ladder (5,3) redirects to Trail Side (17,15).
- Conclusion: Access to Wise Trio Room is now only via the Trail Side.
- Plan: Talk to the Wise Trio Sages in 4_2. They might have new dialogue about the "Tower Shook" event.
- Observation: "Map Objects On Screen" is EMPTY in the Wise Trio Room (4_2).
- Conclusion: The Wise Trio Sages (Gaku, Masa, Koji) are GONE.
- Hypothesis: They might have moved to the Tin Tower or disappeared after the "Tower Shook" event.
- Plan: Verify they are gone by walking to (4,4), then exit to Tin Tower Yard to check for changes there.
- Back in Tin Tower 1F.
- Sage detected at (11,11). This is the "Center Sage".
- Hypothesis: Since the Wise Trio left their room (4_2), this Sage might now have updated dialogue or be one of the Wise Trio.
- Action: Talk to him immediately.
- Center Sage (11,11) gave generic lore about Ho-Oh reviving the beasts. No update.
- Checking Right Sage (14,6) to see if his dialogue has changed since the Wise Trio disappeared.
- Right Sage (14,6) also gave generic lore ("The two TOWERS...").
- Checking Left Sage (5,9) now.
- Hypothesis: If ALL Sages give generic lore, I might need to check the Dance Theater (Kimono Girls) or the "Tower Shook" event requires a specific trigger I missed (maybe Eusine is elsewhere).
- CRITICAL: I previously battled Suicune on Tin Tower 1F and whited out (Turn 15550).
- Current status: Suicune is GONE from 1F. Warp to 2F is INACTIVE.
- Wandering Sage says "A Pokemon returned to the top".
- Hypothesis: Suicune might have moved to the Roof, or reset, but I cannot access 2F.
- Goal: Determine how to re-trigger the event or access 2F.
- Checking (9,9) for hidden items/residue.
