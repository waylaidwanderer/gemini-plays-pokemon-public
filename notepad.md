- **Timestamp:** Turn 25496 (Jan 6, 2026)
- **Primary Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Immediate Task:** Reach the Northwest area of Silver Cave Outside.
- **Current Status:** Escaping the "Middle Pocket" via Row 32.
- **Route:**
    1. Navigate East along Row 32 to x=39.

- **Goal:** Traverse Route 28 Westward to find the hidden entrance to the NW section of Silver Cave Outside.
- **Observations:** Row 34 is a solid wall of Fake Ledges. Row 30 is blocked by West-facing ledges. Row 32 is the only Eastbound path.

# Tile Mechanics & Observations
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT:** Standard one-way jumpable tiles.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Inconsistent behavior observed.
    - **Confirmed Ledge:** (39, 32) allowed jumping South.
    - **Confirmed Wall:** (6, 30) and (28, 34) blocked movement South.
    - **Strategy:** Treat as WALL unless verified otherwise.
- **Navigation Notes:**
    - The "Central" area (x=5) connects to the West path via Row 22 (re-verified via Mental Map).
    - Row 30 acts as a hard barrier across most of the map, separating the North and South sections.
