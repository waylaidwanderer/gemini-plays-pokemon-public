## Game Mechanics
- Saving Money: Mom saves a portion of winnings.
- COUNTER: Impassable object. Interact from the front to speak with NPCs behind it.
- LADDER: Warps between floors.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Context-dependent. Acts as a ramp (climbable South->North) and ridge (walkable horizontally) in Union Cave.
- Accuracy Debuffs: Verified effective survival tactic against strong opponents (e.g. Silver's Croconaw).

## Strategy Notes
- Team Strategy: Paprika (Quilava) is the carry. Basalt (Geodude) needs training.
- Tactics: Smokescreen vs physical attackers/type disadvantages.
- Protocol: Mark NPCs immediately.

## Lessons Learned
- Record new Pokémon discoveries immediately, even during battle.
- Always verify object existence before interacting.
- **NPC Interaction:** Use `stun_npc` on moving NPCs to ensure successful interaction.
- **Smokescreen Survival:** Against stronger/type-advantaged opponents, stacking accuracy debuffs is a verified survival strategy.
