# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Standard walkable ground.
- WATER: Traversable only via Surf.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- WALL: Impassable obstacle.

# Suicune Capture Strategy
- Lead: XENON (Haunter, Lv44).
- Move 1: Hypnosis (Sleep). Accuracy is key.
- Move 2: Night Shade (44 dmg). Suicune (Lv40) has ~120 HP. Use twice for Red health.
- Move 3: Dream Eater (100 power). Only works if Suicune is asleep.
- Item: Ultra Balls (32).
- Backup: GORP (Snorlax) as a tank. Calcifer (Typhlosion) is risky due to type disadvantage.

# Strategic Plan: The Great Spiral (Final Verified)
- Start Turn: 48151.
- Step 1: Walk to East Coast Surf Point at (19, 30). (In Progress)
- Step 2: Surf East to Outer Channel (X=27), then North to Row 10.
- Step 3: Navigate the Great Spiral Buoy Maze:
  - Gap 1: (26, 10) - Outer to Middle Channel.
  - Gap 2: (22, 16) - Middle to Inner Channel.
  - Gap 3: (19, 21) - Inner to Center Channel.
  - Gap 4: (18, 26) - Center to Approach Channel.
  - Gap 5: (16, 20) - Approach to Final Channel.
- Step 4: Land at (16, 11) on the North Plateau.
- Step 5: Walk to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune sighting.
- Status: XENON leading, Repel active.

# Lessons Learned
- Pathing: Cianwood is a fortress of plateaus. All land routes to the north beach are blocked by walls or cliffs.
- Navigation: The Great Spiral is the ONLY aquatic path to the North Plateau. Previous 'Spiral analysis' was wrong due to unseen tiles.
- Blockage: (7, 45) is a Gym Sign. (5, 44) is a WALL. (6, 46) is a ledge face.
