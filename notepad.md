# Suicune Capture Strategy
- Start Turn: 47680
- Lead: XENON (Haunter, Lv44).
- Move 1: Hypnosis (Sleep).
- Move 2: Night Shade (44 dmg). Suicune has ~120 HP. Use twice for Red health.
- Item: Ultra Balls (32).

# Strategic Plans: Locate Suicune
## The 'Beach Shortcut' (New Primary Route)
- Hypothesis: The northern plateau is inaccessible from the water. The intended path is walking North along the West beach at X=2.
- Access Point: A 6-tile wide gap in the internal city walls at X=5, Y=46-51.
- Route:
  1. Land at (19, 30) (East Coast Surf Point).
  2. Walk West through the gap at (5, 47) to reach the beach.
  3. Walk North along the sand (X=2) to Y=10.
  4. Walk East to Suicune at (14, 10).
- Status: Pivoting to this route. Maze logic confirmed likely dead end.

## Failed Hypotheses
- The Great Spiral: Blocked by solid buoy/wall barriers at Y=9 and Y=15. (1 attempt).
- Gem Shortcut (11, 15): Confirmed 1x1 dead-end pocket.

# Suicune Capture Strategy
- Lead: XENON (Haunter, Lv44).
- Move 1: Hypnosis (Sleep).
- Move 2: Night Shade (Fixed 44 dmg). Use 2 times for ~75% damage.
- Item: Ultra Balls. (32 available).

# Reflection Turn 48083
- Error: Hallucinated Lane 2 as Northbound. Hit BUOY wall at (23, 9).
- Correction: Lane 2 is Southbound. Re-tracing spiral steps to reach Gap 2.
- Progress: Deep in the buoy maze. Super Repel active.
- Note: (18, 26) is Gap 4, leading to the final two lanes. Must reach it again.
