# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Current Status
- **Location**: Cianwood City (22_9), Inside Pharmacy.
- **Interaction**: Pharmacist dialogue loop.
- **Hypothesis**: "You came from OLIVINE?" is just text. The question is "Do you remember the four islands along the way?". Answering YES leads to lore. I must answer NO.
- **Status**: Currently in "YES" branch (Lore). I accidentally selected YES at Turn 16643.
- **Expectation**: After the lore explanation ("mythical sea creature"), the dialogue will likely END. I will then need to talk to him again and answer NO.
- **Strategy**: 
  1. Advance lore text until dialogue closes.
  2. Talk to Pharmacist again.
  3. Answer 'NO' to "Do you remember the four islands?".
- **Current Step**: Advancing lore text.
- **Party**: Garnet (Lvl 40, 64/128 HP), Headache (Surf).
- **Quest**: Obtain Mineral Badge (Jasmine).

### Objectives
- **Primary**: Obtain Mineral Badge (Jasmine).
- **Secondary**: Get SecretPotion (Cianwood).
- **Tertiary**: Train Basil to Lvl 21.

### Notes
- **Cianwood Pharmacy**: Supposed to have the SecretPotion.
- **Gym**: Chuck (Fighting). Weak to Psychic/Flying. Needs Strength (HM04) to reach.
- **Plan**:
  1. Get SecretPotion (Current).
  2. Buy Repels at General Store (22_3).
  3. Surf to Olivine City.
  4. Get HM04 (Strength) from Café.
  5. Climb Lighthouse, Heal Amphy.
  6. Defeat Jasmine (Steel) with Garnet.
  7. Return to Cianwood (Surf), Defeat Chuck, get Fly.
- **Shuckle Guy**: Found at (17, 41) in Cianwood (Map 22_4). Offers a Shuckle to look after.
- **Search Update**: Building at (17, 41) is NOT the Pharmacy. Pharmacy is likely South of the Pokemon Center.
- **Discovery**: Found a previously unnoticed door at (15, 37) in Cianwood.
- **Hypothesis**: This is likely the Pharmacy.
- **Plan**: Navigate to (15, 38) and enter.
