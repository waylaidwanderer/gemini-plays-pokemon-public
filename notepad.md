# Reflection & Strategy Notes (Turn 36288)
- **Menu Navigation:** The Pokegear cursor remembers its last position. To reliably open the Map, use `Left, Left` (forces cursor to BACK) then `Right` (selects MAP).
- **Roamer Behavior:** Observed persistent clustering on Route 38 and 44 for ~30 turns. If this persists for another 20 turns, consider relocating to Ecruteak/Route 37 to disrupt the pattern.
- **Shuffle Timing:** Warp transitions require ~5000-6000ms sleep in tools to be safe.
- **Session Stats:** Start: Turn 34090. Current: 36315.

# Tile Mechanics
- **Ledge Hop:** One-way jump over ledges.
- **Headbutt Tree:** Can be shaken for Pokemon.
- **WARP_CARPET_LEFT:** Map transition tile.

# Hall of Fame Entry

- **Date:** Turn 33314
- **MVP:** Muscle (Machoke) Lv88.

# Completed Objectives
- **Pewter to Saffron Transit:** Completed via Mt. Moon & Magnet Train.
- **Observation:** Walked ~20 steps on Route 38 with Repel (Lv36 Lead) and found nothing. Assuming Roamers are not present. Shuffling.
- **Observation:** Roamers confirmed on Route 42 and 44 (East). Shuffling again.
- **Event:** Received phone call from Cooltrainer Gaven (Turn 36326).
- **Inventory Update:** Confirmed 0 Repels in bag (Game State). Must walk through grass without protection.

- **Bug Report:** Fly Map cursor stuck on Silver Cave (Turn 36476). Cannot Fly to Goldenrod. Walking instead.
- **Tool Note:** `pathfind` has a 50-step safety limit. For long-distance travel (e.g. National Park traversal), break the path into intermediate waypoints (approx 15-20 steps away).
- **Resupply Plan:** In Goldenrod Dept Store 2F. Top Clerk checked (No Super Repels). Buying bulk Standard Repels from Bottom Clerk instead.
- **Shop Data:** 
  - 2F Bottom Clerk (13,6): Poke Ball, Great Ball, Escape Rope, Repel, Revive, Full Heal, Poke Doll, Flower Mail.
  - 2F Top Clerk (13,5): Potion, Super Potion, Antidote, Parlyz Heal, Awakening, Burn Heal, Ice Heal.
  - Conclusion: No Super Repels available. Using Standard Repels.
- **Resupply Plan:** Buying 17 Standard Repels at Goldenrod Dept Store (Bottom Clerk). Cost: ¥5950.
