# Current Objectives
*   **Primary Goal:** Obtain the Boulder Badge from the Pewter City Gym Leader, Brock.
*   **Secondary Goal:** Acquire sufficient funds to purchase essential supplies. (Current Money: ¬•156)
*   **Tertiary Goal:** Reach Route 3 (East Pewter Exit at (40,19)) to battle trainers for funds.

# Pewter City Strategy & Current Plan
*   **Current Location:** (5,21) in Pewter City, facing Down. Pikachu at (5,20).
*   **Immediate Goal:** Reach Route 3.
*   **Current Route 3 Strategy (Attempt #6f - Gym Reset from (18,21) & Far West-South-East Detour Mk2):**
    1.  Current location (18,21), facing Right. Pikachu at (17,21). Blocked east by impassable (19,21). North of (18,19) is impassable (18,18). Stuck in western pocket (X=17-18, Y=19-21) AGAIN.
    2.  Immediate Plan: Use Gym warp at (17,18) to escape.
        a.  Move Left from (18,21) to (17,21).
        b.  Move North from (17,21) to (17,18) (Gym Warp).
    3.  After exiting Gym (will land at (17,19)):
        a.  Move West from (17,19) to (5,19).
        b.  Move South from (5,19) to (5,21). (Tile (5,22) is known impassable, this is an intended stop).
        c.  Move East from (5,21) to (34,21). (Will verify (35,21) if (34,21) is reached successfully).
        d.  Move South from (34,21) to (34,32).
        e.  Move East from (34,32) to (35,32).
        f.  Move North from (35,32) to (35,30).
        g.  Move East from (35,30) to (37,30).
        h.  Move South from (37,30) to (37,32).
        i.  Move East from (37,32) to (40,32).
        j.  Move North from (40,32) to (40,19) (Route 3 exit).
    4.  This detour aims to bypass all previously encountered X=19, Y=22, and X=36 blockades systematically. Will pay close attention to screen and map XML for each step, and use `move_validator_agent` for tricky short segments if unsure.

*   **Known Pathing Obstacles in Pewter City:**
    *   (34,20) - Impassable building facade. (Marked üß±)
    *   (36,27) - Impassable. (Marked üß±)
    *   (35,26) - Impassable.
    *   X=36 column is largely impassable from Y=21 down to Y=32 (house structures).
    *   Western 'pocket' near Gym (X=5-18, Y=19-21) requires Gym warp to escape if entered from east/south of it. This pocket includes impassable tiles at (19,19)-(19,21), (18,18), (17,22), (5,22).
    *   Pokecenter entrance is at (14,26), entered by moving Up from (14,27).

# Agent Usage Plan
*   **`scripted_event_tracker_agent`:** MUST use for any eastern path segments near Y=19 (e.g., from (33,19) towards (40,19)) to assess risk from Youngster (36,17).
*   **`move_validator_agent`:** Use for short, complex, or risky manual pathing segments if unsure, especially after an agent path is provided or if screen details are ambiguous.
*   **`map_analyzer_agent`:** Use for finding paths in complex areas if manual attempts fail. Critically review its output.
*   **`money_management_agent`:** Use once sufficient funds are acquired to plan purchases.
*   **`route_progress_analyzer_agent` / `battle_log_analyzer_agent`:** Keep in mind for Route 3 / after battles.

# Game Mechanics & Strategy Notes
*   **Ledge Mechanics:** One-way (downwards only).
*   **Movement:** 1st press TURNS if not facing, 2nd press MOVES. Pikachu: 1st press turns, 2nd moves if moving *into* his tile and not facing him.
*   **Level Cap:** 0 badges = Lv12.
*   **Map Marker Legend:** üí• (Confirmed Event Trigger), üéØ (Drop-off/Key Nav Point), ‚ùó (Risky Zone/Obstacle), üíÅ (Event NPCs), ‚ò†Ô∏è (Defeated Trainers), üèõÔ∏è (Building Entrance), üìç (Key Navigation Point / Start of new route attempt), üß± (Confirmed Impassable Blocker), üö™ (Used Warp), ‚ÑπÔ∏è (Info NPC).
*   **Tile Navigability:** Inferred from tile `type` (e.g., 'ground', 'grass') and presence of blocking objects/NPCs. 'Impassable' type is a hard block. Cross-reference screen, map XML, and game state.

# Party Status
*   SPBARKY (PIKACHU): Lv12 (39/39 HP) (Capped)
*   FLAREE (VULPIX): Lv8 (26/26 HP)
*   ODDISH (ODDISH): Lv12 (37/37 HP) (Capped)

# Hindsight & Lessons Learned (Post-Critique Turn 5650)
*   **Notepad `replace` failures:** Using `overwrite` for major cleanups is more reliable than trying to find exact `old_text` for `replace` after many micro-updates.
*   **Screen Check Imperative:** ALWAYS check tiles immediately adjacent (especially in direction of planned movement) on screen *before* committing to multi-step moves. Don't rely solely on map memory or agent paths without visual confirmation of the very next step if possible.
*   **Agent Output Review:** Critically review agent-provided paths against screen and map XML. Agents can make mistakes (e.g., `map_analyzer_agent` suggesting path through impassable tiles on turn 5563).
*   **Youngster Avoidance:** Eastern Pewter is a minefield. High-risk paths near him should be treated with extreme caution and use `scripted_event_tracker_agent`. Intentional escort trigger can be a valid strategy if planned.
*   **Pikachu & Warps:** Be mindful of Pikachu's position near warps; accidental turns can lead to re-entering warps.
*   **Map Awareness:** Must improve fundamental map awareness and recall of impassable tiles to avoid repeating failed paths, especially in known 'pocket' areas like western Pewter City.
*   **Strategic Shifts:** When an approach repeatedly fails, make more radical strategic shifts rather than minor variations on the failed path.
*   **Dormant Agent Ideas:** Removed 'Youngster Event Predictor Agent' and 'Path Refinement Agent' to maintain focus. Will reconsider if a need arises and agent slots are available.
