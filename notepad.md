# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Active Strategy: The True Sea Route (Final)
The northern plateau (X=13-16, Row 10-14) is accessible by landing on its eastern edge (X=16) from a specific sea pocket.

1. Surf North to (24, 16). (In Progress)
2. Surf West through the gap at (22, 16) to (20, 16).
3. Surf North to (20, 11).
4. Surf West and land at (16, 11).
5. Walk North to (16, 10) (Jumping the FLOOR_UP_WALL ledge).
6. Walk West to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune sighting.

## Verified Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement (Confirmed at (10, 47) -> (10, 48)).
- Western Corridor: X=0-2 is clear of ledges from Row 51 to Row 10. (Backup route).
- Central Pool: Enclosed by buoys; no exit to the north or west.

## Battle Plan: Eusine
- Lead: Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion).
- Strategy: Flamethrower for Drowzee/Haunter, Thunderpunch for Electrode.
- Status: Party healthy. No Repels remaining; run from wild encounters.
