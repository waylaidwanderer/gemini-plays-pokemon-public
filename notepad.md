- **Roamers**: Do NOT appear on Pokegear map until first encounter.
- **Phone Calls**: Scripted phone calls interrupt menu sequences and tools.
- **Notepad Hygiene**: Avoid recording turn-by-turn movement in persistent notes.
- **Ledges**: Vertical movement is restricted by one-way ledges. Use gaps to return.
- **Menu Persistence**: The game remembers cursor positions in menus. Always verify location before pressing A.
