# I. Core Gameplay & World Rules
- **Poison Damage:** Poisoned Pokémon in the party lose 1 HP every four steps taken outside of battle.
- **Fainted Pokémon can use HMs:** Confirmed that a fainted Pokémon can be selected to use a field move like Strength.
- **Follower Pokémon Mechanics:** When moving onto a tile occupied by Pikachu, the player and Pikachu appear to swap positions. The first button press turns to face, the second moves.

# II. Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- `ground`: Walkable tile.
- `grass`: Tall grass where wild Pokémon appear. Walkable like `ground`.
- `elevated_ground`: Walkable ground at a higher elevation. Movement to/from `ground` tiles requires `steps` or a one-way `ledge` drop.
- **One-Way Drop:** It is possible to drop down from an `elevated_ground` tile to an adjacent `ground` tile.
- `cleared_boulder_barrier`: A tile that becomes traversable after a boulder switch is activated. Acts like `elevated_ground` and can function as a one-way ramp up.
- `steps`: Connects `ground` and `elevated_ground` tiles, allowing vertical movement between them.
- `ledge`: Can only be traversed downwards from an adjacent tile above it.
- `water`: Crossable using HM Surf.
- `impassable`: Walls, rocks, and sometimes objects like defeated trainers. Cannot be entered.
- `ladder_down` / `ladder_up`: Warps between floors.
- `hole`: Warps the player (or a boulder) to the floor below.
- `boulder_switch`: Floor switch for boulders.
- `boulder_barrier`: Impassable barrier linked to a boulder switch.
- `warp`: A tile that transports the player to another location, often a door or cave entrance.

# III. Puzzle Mechanics & Solutions
- **Reset Condition:** Boulder puzzles reset upon leaving and re-entering a map or using ladders between floors.
- **Boulder/Item Interaction:** Pushing a boulder onto an item collects the item and moves the boulder into that space.
- **Strength Push Mechanics:** The push is executed from an adjacent tile, and only the boulder moves.

# IV. Battle Intelligence
## A. Type Effectiveness Chart (OBSERVATION-ONLY)
- **Super Effective (2x damage):**
  - Electric > Flying, Water, Rock/Ground
  - Water > Rock/Ground, Fire
  - Ground > Rock/Ground, Fire, Electric, Rock
  - Ice > Ground, Grass, Flying, Dragon
  - Flying > Fighting, Grass, Bug
  - Fighting > Normal, Rock, Ice
- **Not Very Effective (0.5x damage):**
  - Normal !> Rock/Ground, Rock
- **Immune (0x damage):**
  - Ground immune to Electric
  - Flying immune to Ground

## B. Strategic Notes & Mechanics
- **"No Will to Fight" Message:** A party menu cursor error on a fainted Pokémon, not a refusal to battle.
- **Struggle Mechanic:** Used automatically only when a Pokémon is out of PP for ALL moves.
- **Full Heal:** Cures status conditions only, does not restore HP.
- **Body Slam:** Can cause paralysis.

# V. Methodology & Lessons Learned
- **Hypothesis-Driven Approach:** I must form a single, testable hypothesis, document it, test it, and record the conclusion. This avoids chaotic, assumption-driven actions.
- **Tool Reliability & Immediate Action:** A tool that produces an incorrect or impossible result is a critical failure. I MUST fix it immediately with `define_tool` instead of deferring the task or attempting workarounds. This is a non-negotiable directive.
- **Trust System Over Tools:** If the system validation check insists a path is reachable while my tools (`pathfinder`, `landmass_analyzer`) say it is not, the system is correct and my tools are flawed. The immediate priority becomes debugging the tool, not continuing to test hypotheses based on the tool's flawed output.
- **Falsify Assumptions:** I must actively try to disprove my own hypotheses, especially regarding navigation. If a path fails, I should use tools like `landmass_analyzer` to verify connectivity before repeatedly attempting the same path. This helps avoid confirmation bias where I assume my tool is wrong instead of my assumption.

# VI. Current Strategy & Plans
## Road to the Indigo Plateau
- **Goal:** Navigate through Route 22 and Route 23 to reach Victory Road.
- **Status:** Currently on Route 22. Need to reach the gatehouse at (9, 6).
- **Plan:**
  1. Generate a valid path from the current position to the gatehouse.
  2. Navigate the path.
  3. Enter the gatehouse warp.
