### Strategic Reflection (Turn 8719)
- **Status**: Stuck in Goldenrod for ~100 turns.
- **Issue**: Oscillating between East/West without clearing the "fog of war".
- **Insight**: The North-East (Flower Shop) is a cul-de-sac. The Central North Wall seems solid. The only remaining option is the North-West quadrant, which is largely "unseen".
- **Action Plan**: 
    1. Return to Main Street (y=10).
    2. Move West to x=6.
    3.Systematically explore North from there, hugging the West edge.

### Navigation Notes
- **Location**: Goldenrod City (North-East).
- **Goal**: Reach Route 35 Gatehouse (North Exit).
- **Immediate Target**: Main Street at (9, 10).
- **Next Step**: Sweep the West Side (x<9).

### Quest Chain: SquirtBottle
1. **Defeat Whitney**: Done (Plain Badge obtained).
2. **Find Floria**: Currently seeking at Route 36.
