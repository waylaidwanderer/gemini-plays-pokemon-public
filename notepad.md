# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement. Passable from SOUTH to NORTH.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at Row 15 (X=3-17).
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
## Strategy: The X=2 Highway (Final)
Reach (14, 10) by navigating to the far western corridor to bypass all ledges.
1. Use SUPER REPEL and Surf West to (17, 26) (Gap in X=18 wall).
2. Surf North to (17, 24) and West to (10, 24).
3. Land at (9, 24).
4. Move West to (4, 24) and North to (4, 22).
5. Move West through gap at (3, 22) to (2, 22).
6. Move North along X=2 corridor to (2, 12) (Bypasses Row 15 ledge).
7. Move East along Row 12 to (14, 12) and North to (14, 10).

# Progress Notes
- Verified: X=2 corridor is the only path through the Row 15 wall (X=3-17).
- Verified: Row 13 wall (X=9-12) blocks central land access to the plateau.
- SUPER REPEL is being used to bypass encounters.
- Stagnation Check: Land maze confirmed as the primary obstacle; X=2 Highway is the solution.
