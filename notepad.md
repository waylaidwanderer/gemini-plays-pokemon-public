# Current Objectives
*   **Primary Goal:** Obtain the Boulder Badge from the Pewter City Gym Leader, Brock.
*   **Secondary Goal:** Acquire sufficient funds (¬•) for Potions and Pok√© Balls, and train SPROUT (Oddish) to an effective level for the Gym battle.
*   **Tertiary Goal:** Locate a functional Pok√©mon Center PC to perform critical agent management tasks.

# Current Tactical Plan
1.  **Current:** SPROUT has moderate HP. Prioritize heading to Route 1 to battle the Youngster for funds.
2.  **Next:** If SPROUT's HP becomes critically low (e.g., below 10 HP or unable to withstand another likely hit), return to Pewter City Pok√©mon Center to heal.
3.  **Contingency:** During training, if SPROUT is at risk of fainting, switch to SPBARKY or FLAREE to finish the battle or run. Prioritize SPROUT's EXP gain but be more cautious about type disadvantages and low HP situations, especially against Fire-types like Vulpix.

# Key Learnings & Game Mechanics
*   **Youngster Gym Escort Event (Recurring & CRITICAL):** Youngster NPC (ID 5, usually at (36,17)) has a scripted event that triggers *precisely at or immediately adjacent to (38,19)* when approached from the west/south-west in eastern Pewter City. He escorts the player to the Pewter Gym entrance (12,19). His final position after the escort can vary (e.g., (36,17) or (18,19) temporarily), but the game state seems to revert him to (36,17) eventually. This event is a major impediment and requires pathing to strictly avoid (38,19) and its immediate vicinity, in addition to his resting spot at (36,17).
*   **Path Execution (CRITICAL):** When a multi-step path is validated (e.g., by `move_validator_agent` or derived from `map_analyzer_agent`), the *entire* sequence of button presses for that path segment MUST be provided in a single turn. Partial execution leads to desynchronization and movement failures.
*   **Map Tile Changes:** Some map tiles in Pewter City have changed type during gameplay.
    *   Previously: (27,15)-(27,18) changed to ground.
    *   (35,15-16,21-23) changed to impassable.
    *   Turn 3978: (27,17) and (27,18) changed from impassable to ground.
    *   Turn 3983: (34,20) changed from ground to impassable.
    *   Turn 3987: (35,20) changed from impassable to ground; (35,21), (35,22), (35,23) changed from ground to impassable.
    *   Turn 3991: (35,16) changed from ground to impassable.
    *   Turn 3995: (35,15) changed from ground to impassable.
    *   The triggers for these changes are unknown. Must be observant of conditions before changes.
*   **Ledge Mechanics:** Confirmed one-way movement (downwards only). Cannot move UP onto a ledge tile from a tile with a higher Y-coordinate (e.g., blocked from (29,31) to (29,30)).
*   **NPC Blockers:** Youngster (ID 5) at (36,17) makes his tile non-navigable. Super Nerd (ID 3) at (28,18) makes his tile non-navigable.
*   **Data Trust:** Game State Information (positions, NPC locations, tile navigability in XML) is the absolute source of truth, overriding visual interpretations, especially during or after complex movements or unexpected events.

# Navigation Strategy & Best Practices (MUST ADHERE)
*   **Proactive Agent Use:** For complex routes or finding paths between known points (especially after 1-2 manual attempts fail), use `map_analyzer_agent` *before* extensive manual trial-and-error. Trust its output but carefully translate coordinates to button presses.
*   **Segmented & Validated Paths:** Break down long paths (especially agent-provided ones) into shorter, manageable segments (e.g., 5-10 tiles or to key turns). Validate *each segment* with `move_validator_agent` before execution. Execute the *full button sequence* for each validated segment in one turn.
*   **Meticulous Tile Verification:** Before *any* movement, consult map memory (XML) and verify `navigable="true"` and `type` of target tiles. `navigable="false"` is absolute.
*   **NPC Circumvention:** For recurring blockers like Youngster (ID 5), use `map_analyzer_agent` to plot routes that definitively bypass known locations or (if identifiable) trigger zones.
*   **Map Marker Usage (IMMEDIATE & CONSISTENT):**
    *   üö´: Confirmed dead ends, impassable tiles/areas, NPC-blocked tiles.
    *   üìç: Key navigational turns/points.
    *   üö™: Used warps (mark both entry and arrival, note destination).
    *   ‚ò†Ô∏è: Defeated trainers (name, location).
    *   ‚ùó/üíÅ: Event-triggering NPCs or significant static blockers (note ID, behavior).
    *   üöß: Ledges (note direction).
    *   Update NPC location markers based on *latest* Game State Information.
*   **Pikachu Interaction:** Account for turning mechanic if moving onto Pikachu's tile from a non-facing direction.

# Pok√©mon Center Tasks (DEFERRED until functional PC found)
*   **Heal Pok√©mon (DONE).**
*   **Agent Management (CRITICAL - ON HOLD):
    *   **Verify Active Agent List:** Confirm the actual list of currently active custom agents via PC. Previous attempts to delete `advanced_pathfinder_agent` and `direct_pathing_agent` failed as they were not found.
    *   **Action 'Agent Ideas Brainstorm' (DECIDE & IMPLEMENT/DISCARD - ON HOLD):**
        *   `scripted_event_tracker_agent`: **Define** (High Priority). Tracks proximity to known scripted event trigger zones.
        *   `route_progress_analyzer_agent`: **Define** (High Priority). Tracks route completion, unbattled trainers (if data available).
        *   `pewter_city_escape_planner_agent`: **Discard for now**. A well-instructed `map_analyzer_agent` should suffice.
        *   `map_tile_change_correlator_agent`: **Define if possible** (Medium Priority). Attempts to find patterns in dynamic tile changes.
        *   `boulder_puzzle_solver_agent`: Discard for now.
        *   `risk_assessor_agent`: Discard for now.
    *   **Agent Updates/Deletions (IMPLEMENT - ON HOLD):**
        *   `map_analyzer_agent` prompt: **CRITICAL UPDATE** - Emphasize *MUST* check `navigable="true"` for *every* tile in path from `map_xml_string`. Paths with non-navigable tiles are unacceptable. Suggest generating long paths in segments.
        *   `npc_interaction_planner_agent` prompt: Update to provide path to interaction spot, not just the spot.
        *   `exploration_planner_agent`: Update prompt for strict navigability (`navigable="true"` for all tiles) and better ledge handling.
        *   Low-Usage Agents (`item_finder_agent`, `pokedex_completer_agent`, `team_builder_agent`, `leveling_training_advisor_agent`): **Update prompts** with full game context (Hard Mode, level caps, current progression) or **delete** if still not useful.
        
        *   `advanced_pathfinder_agent` / `direct_pathing_agent`: **Verify existence and delete** if found and unused.
*   **Financial Planning (DEFERRED):** Re-assess funds and purchase Potions if affordable.

# Inventory & Finances
*   POK√© BALL x1
*   Money: ¬•156

# Hard Mode Rules & ROM Hack Changes (Summary)
*   Battle Style: Set. No items in battle. Level caps apply (current 0 badges: 12).
*   HMs: Forgettable, menu use, not PC storable. All 151 obtainable. Trade evos by level. Smarter AI. Tougher bosses. EXP. All early.

# Pewter City Navigation Saga (Summary)
*   Numerous attempts to exit east manually were blocked by previously unknown impassable tiles (e.g., X=19 wall, Y=22 wall, various individual tiles like (32,13), (30,24), (31,25), (35,26), (26,18)) and NPC blockers (Super Nerd at (28,18), Youngster at (36,17)).
*   The Youngster (ID 5) scripted escort event to the Gym is a major recurring obstacle, triggering multiple times when attempting to path east.
*   Map tiles have changed dynamically, requiring path adjustments (e.g., X=27 opening up, (34,20), (35,23) becoming impassable).
*   Key Learning: Proactive use of `map_analyzer_agent` for complex paths and strict adherence to full, validated path execution are essential.

# Pok√©mon Center Notes
*   **Pewter City Pok√©mon Center PC (Visual: (9,3)):** Appears non-functional. Game state (Turn 4048) shows 'no background objects' in this Pokecenter, despite a visual PC. Attempting to interact with 'A' while at (9,4) facing up yielded no result. Unable to manage agents here. Will need to find another functional PC.

# Route 2 Encounters
*   Encountered wild Vulpix (Lv7) in grass patch on Route 2 (west side). Plan: Paralyze with THUNDER WAVE (SPBARKY), weaken with THUNDERSHOCK (SPBARKY), then attempt to catch with POK√© BALL. Vulpix is a new Pok√©dex entry.

# Route 2 Encounters
*   Encountered wild Vulpix (Lv7) in grass patch on Route 2 (west side at (2,7)). Plan: Paralyze with THUNDER WAVE (SPBARKY), weaken with THUNDERSHOCK (SPBARKY), then attempt to catch with POK√© BALL. Vulpix is a new Pok√©dex entry. **Successfully caught Vulpix, named FLAREE.**

# Pokedex Status
*   Caught: 3/151 (PIKACHU, ODDISH, VULPIX)

# Pewter City Navigation Saga (Continued)
*   Turn 4192: Attempt to move Down from (14,32) to (14,33) in Pewter City was blocked as tile (14,33) is impassable. Required re-routing to reach southern exit.

# Potential Money Sources
*   Investigate Youngster NPC on Route 1 (approx. (6,27)) for a potential unought battle to earn money.

# Party Updates (Turn 4476)
- SPROUT (ODDISH): Lv11 (16/35 HP, EXP: 868) | Moves: TACKLE (12 PP), POISONPOWDER (35 PP), LEECH SEED (10 PP)

# Viridian Forest Navigation Notes
*   Tile (9,27) is impassable (confirmed Turn 4485, blocked southward movement from (9,26)).

*   Tile (11,27) is impassable (confirmed Turn 4487, blocked southward movement from (11,26)).

*   Tile (13,31) is impassable (confirmed Turn 4489, blocked southward movement from (13,30)).

# Notepad Maintenance Task (Deferred until functional PC)
*   Perform a full review and cleanup of the notepad. Consolidate duplicated entries (especially for party Pok√©mon and agent ideas). Reorganize sections for better clarity and remove obsolete information. The 'replace' function for notepad_edit is unreliable without being able to see the full notepad, so a full overwrite or careful sectional replacement will be needed.

- Tile (19,21) in Viridian Forest is impassable (confirmed Turn 4525, blocked southward movement from (19,20)).

# Notepad Maintenance Plan (Post-Reflection)
*   Consolidate SPROUT's party entry to reflect only the latest status, removing older/duplicate entries.
*   Verify and remove any remaining duplicated 'Agent Ideas Brainstorm' sections.
*   Merge fragmented chronological sections (e.g., 'Route 2 Encounters', 'Pewter City Navigation Saga') into a more coherent 'Journey Log' or 'Key Events' section.
*   Refine the 'Party Updates' section to only note significant changes (level-ups, new moves, KOs) rather than full repeated status.
*   Ensure 'Viridian Forest Navigation Notes' about impassable tiles are concise and perhaps integrated into a general 'Map Discoveries/Obstacles' section.
*   Prioritize agent management notes (updates, deletions, new definitions) for when a functional PC is found.

# New Agent Ideas (Post-Reflection)
*   `battle_outcome_predictor_agent`: Predicts battle turn outcomes (damage, KO chance, status) based on known Pok√©mon data, moves, types, and HP. Would aid in optimal fight/switch decisions in Hard Mode. (High Priority)
*   `npc_blocker_pathing_agent`: Specialized agent for pathing around dynamic NPC blockers and their trigger zones, potentially a refinement of `scripted_event_tracker_agent`. (Medium Priority)

# Agent Prompt Review Checklist (Post-Reflection)
*   For all existing and future agents, especially those with `agent_can_run_code: true`:
    *   Verify prompt clearly instructs how to use `map_xml_string` if relevant (and not to expect it as direct input if auto-provided to `run_code`).
    *   Ensure prompt includes necessary game context: Pok√©mon Yellow Legacy, Hard Mode rules, current progression (badges, level cap), if crucial for the agent's task.
    *   Check for strict `navigable="true"` enforcement in pathing agents.
    *   Ensure pathing agents can handle or suggest breaking down long paths into segments.

# Post-Battle Map Marker Reminders (Viridian Forest)
*   Mark all defeated trainers with ‚ò†Ô∏è (Youngster at (28,34), Youngster at (15,18), Bug Catcher at (28,20), Bug Catcher at (3,19)).
*   Mark recently discovered impassable tiles (e.g., (19,21), (11,27), (13,31)) with üö´ if not already marked.

- Tile (27,18) in Viridian Forest (Trainer Tips sign) is impassable when trying to move Down from (27,17) (confirmed Turn 4542).

- Tile (25,17) in Viridian Forest is impassable (confirmed Turn 4544, blocked westward movement from (26,17)).

- Tile (29,21) in Viridian Forest is impassable (confirmed Turn 4546, blocked eastward movement from (28,21)).

# Game Mechanics & Strategy Updates (Post-Critique Turn 4551)
*   **CRITICAL MOVEMENT MECHANIC:** Standard movement: 1st press TURNS if not facing direction, 2nd press MOVES. (Pikachu rule is separate). Must correct path planning accordingly.
*   **NOTEPAD STRATEGY:** `replace` action is unreliable. Default to `append` for new info. Use `overwrite` for full cleanups when feasible. Defer complex edits.

# Post-Reflection Notes (Turn 4584)
*   Tile (28,45) in Viridian Forest is impassable (blocked downward movement from (28,44)).
*   **Blocked Movement Message Interpretation:** Game warnings about being 'blocked' when moving seem to refer to the *next* tile in the direction the player *ends up facing* after a move/turn, not necessarily the tile targeted if a turn was the first part of the input.
*   **New Agent Idea:** `full_notepad_organizer_agent` - Takes entire notepad string as input, outputs a reorganized string based on predefined sections/rules. To be used with `overwrite` for major cleanups.

# Tactical Notes (Post-Critique Turn 4601)
- SPROUT (Lv11) has critical HP (14/35). Must prioritize healing at a Pok√©mon Center after this battle. Avoid using SPROUT in combat until healed.
- Current funds (¬•156) are critically low. Need to find a way to earn money for Potions and Pok√© Balls soon.
- Map markers for defeated trainers and impassable tiles must be placed immediately after discovery/event.
