# Gem's Strategic Plan & Learnings

## 1. Current Objective & Plan
- **Objective:** Defeat Misty and earn the Cascade Badge.
- **Plan:** Travel east from Pewter City through Mt. Moon to reach Cerulean City. 

## 2. Party Status
- Party is fully healed. The level cap is 21.
- **Next Training Focus:** KITSUNE (Vulpix) and THISTLE (Nidoran♀) need levels.

## 3. Key Learnings & Strategy
*   **Navigation Failure (Pewter City):** My attempt to find a shortcut through the central plaza was a catastrophic failure over 40+ turns, leading to SPROUT fainting. I must trace a full, clear path on the map before committing, even if it's longer. Do not repeat failed paths. Use the `map_layout_analyzer_agent` for new complex areas.
*   **Tool-Use Discipline:** Always verify agent output with logic and observation. Use the `pre_adventure_checker_agent` before major undertakings.
*   **Risk Management:** Be decisive. A long but guaranteed route is better than multiple failed shortcuts. Sometimes a sacrifice is the most efficient path to the main objective.
*   **Recognize Scripted Events:** If a path is illogically blocked, it's likely a story gate. Don't brute-force it; explore other options.

## 4. World Clues
*   Team Rocket is at **Mt. Moon**.
*   The eastern route out of Pewter was blocked. I need to check if my Boulder Badge changes this.
*   Moon Stones come from **Mt. Moon**.

*   **Game Mechanics Correction:** Poison damage outside of battle is 1 HP per 4 steps, not per step. My flawed assumption led to the unnecessary (and failed) rush to the Pewter City Pokémon Center.
