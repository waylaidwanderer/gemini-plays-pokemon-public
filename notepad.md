# Suicune Quest Strategy (Crystal)
- Status: ROAMING (Post-Tin Tower battle).
- Current Location (Pokedex): Route 37 (Turn 19218).
- Strategy: Boundary cycling between Ecruteak City and Route 37.
- Lead: XENON (Gastly Lv21) with Mean Look and Hypnosis.

# Suicune Battle Strategy (Lv40)
- Goal: Prevent flee and capture.
- Turn 1: Use MEAN LOOK (XENON). 
- Speed Check: Suicune (Base 85, Lv40) is likely faster than Gastly (Base 80, Lv21). If Suicune moves first, it flees.
- Solution: Need to level XENON or use Quick Claw if available (check inventory).
- Turn 2+: Use HYPNOSIS.
- Turn 3+: Chip damage with NIGHT SHADE (fixed damage = level).
- Note: If Suicune uses Roar, Mean Look is broken.

# Capture Prep & Funding
- Strategy: Mean Look -> Hypnosis -> Chip away HP (if safe) -> Throw Balls.
- Resources: 1 Ultra Ball, 23 Great Balls.
- Funds: ¥2373.
- Note: Max Revive and Full Restore are in inventory.

# Ultra Ball Hypotheses
- Hypothesis 1: Goldenrod Dept. Store sells Ultra Balls.
- Hypothesis 2: Blackthorn City Mart sells Ultra Balls.
- Hypothesis 3: Indigo Plateau Mart sells Ultra Balls.

# Boundary Cycling Plan (Ecruteak <-> Route 37)
1. Move to (17, 35) in Ecruteak City.
2. Step south to Route 37.
