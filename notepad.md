# Strategy: The Suicune Pursuit
- **Time Check:** Attempting sighting since Turn #50620.
- **Objective:** Trigger Suicune sighting at (14, 10) in northern Cianwood.
- **Eusine Battle Prep:** Lead with Lv64 Calcifer. Sweep with Flamethrower/Thunderpunch.
- **Current Plan (The Southern Surf Loop):**
  1. Currently at (29, 6) on WATER.
  2. Surf South to (29, 51).
  3. Walk West on Row 51 to (2, 51).
  4. Walk North via X=2 corridor to (2, 10).
  5. Walk East to (14, 10) for the sighting.
- **Verification:** Row 51 is a clear horizontal corridor. X=2 corridor is clear of all one-way barriers.

# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Standard traversable terrain.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable terrain.
- WATER: Traversable only with Surf.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump DOWN (South). Blocks North movement.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL (Terrace Climb): One-way jump UP (North). Blocks South movement.
- ROCK (Object): Blocks movement; cleared with Rock Smash.

# Area Notes: Cianwood City
- **Dead Ends:** (11, 15) is a pocket blocked by WALL at (11, 13) and (12, 14).
- **Shortcut Tiles:** (5, 29), (4, 25), (8, 16), (9, 17) (Smashed Rocks).
- **Partition wall:** (29, 49) is a dead end from the North.
