# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Stop Team Rocket.
- **Secondary Goal:** Investigate Radio Tower (Team Rocket takeover).
- **Navigation:** Removing Mail from Kenya (Retry).
- **Status:** Exiting PC to manage Mail.
- **Reason:** Kenya STILL has Mail (Deposit failed with "Remove MAIL"). Previous removal attempt failed or was not saved. Retrying via Party Menu.
- **Plan:**
    1. Exit PC (B, B, B).
    2. Open Party Menu (Start, A).
    3. Select Kenya.
    4. Select "MAIL" -> "TAKE MAIL".
    5. Verify removal (Icon disappearance).
    6. Deposit Kenya.

# Reflection (Turn 11638)
- **Execution:** PC navigation has been clumsy. Repeatedly tried to deposit Kenya with Mail, which failed. "Move w/o Mail" also proved confusing/ineffective.
- **Lesson:** Mail MUST be removed via the Party Menu ("TAKE MAIL") before depositing a Pokémon. PC "Move w/o Mail" is unreliable or requires specific conditions.
- **Hygiene:** Map markers are good. Added "Item Storage PC" to avoid future confusion.
- **Goals:** Clear. Immediate focus is swapping Kenya for Togepi.
- **Strategy:** Pivot to manual Mail removal in Party Menu to resolve the PC deadlock.
- **Quest Info:** Rocket Uniform NOT needed (Crystal specific). Fight the Grunt at Radio Tower 2F.
- **Quest Info:** Showing Togepi to Elm awards Everstone (Side Quest).
- **Locked Door:** Underground (18, 6) needs a key. Remember this for later.
