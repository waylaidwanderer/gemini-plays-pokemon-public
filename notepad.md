# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Reach the Dragon Shrine via the West Whirlpool.

# Current Status (Turn 18318)
- **Location:** Dragon's Den B1F (11, 14).
- **Action:** Navigate East to the central channel via Row 10.
- **Reasoning:** 
    - The "West Channel" was a distraction.
    - Analysis of the map reveals the path to the Whirlpool at (15, 23) is from the **North**, via the **East** side of the buoys.
    - Columns 11-15 are blocked by buoys at Row 16.
    - However, Column 16 is clear!
    - To get to Column 16, I must go North to Row 10 (as (15,14) is a buoy).
- **Goal:** Reach (16, 10) then surf South to approach the Whirlpool at (15, 23) from the North.

# Plan
1. Navigate to (16, 10).
2. Surf South to (16, 21).
3. Move West to (15, 21).
4. Interact with Whirlpool at (15, 23).

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Obstacle.

# Tile Mechanics

# Lessons
