# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Current Status
- **Location**: Route 39 (Moomoo Farm entrance).
- **Party**: Basil (Lvl 17, Cut/Sleep Pwd - Lost Vine Whip!), Garnet (Lvl 36), Topaz (Lvl 15). All healed.

### Lighthouse Navigation
- **1F**: Entrance (10, 17). Stairs Up (3, 11).
- **2F**: Stairs Down (3, 11). Stairs Up to 3F at (5, 3).
- **3F**: Stairs Down at (5, 3). Stairs Up to 4F at (13, 3).
- **4F**: Stairs Down at (13, 3). Stairs Up to 5F at (3, 5).
- **5F**: Exploring.

### Notes
- **Strategy**: Explore Olivine City. Locate Pokémon Center to heal team. Find Jasmine (Gym Leader) at the Lighthouse.
- **Status**: Garnet evolved into Typhlosion! Inside Olivine Lighthouse. Climbing to find Jasmine.
- **Quest**: Heal Sick Miltank (Moomoo Farm). Gave 1 Berry. Needs more (approx 4-6 more regular Berries).
- **Quest**: Heal Amphy (Ampharos) at Lighthouse. Jasmine is with it. Need to cure it to challenge her.
- **Hint**: Gentleman Preston mentions Jasmine *used to* use Rock Pokémon like Onix. Implies she might have switched types (likely Steel).
- **Hint**: Sailor Kent suggests the Pharmacy in Cianwood has medicine.
- **5F**: Side corridors (TM34/Rare Candy) are dead ends. Hole at (16, 7) leads to 4F East Side (Dead end?).
- **4F (East Side)**: Accessed via hole from 5F (16, 7). Connected to Main Area via Top Corridor?
- **Hypothesis**: The Center Area of 4F (with stairs to Jasmine?) is isolated. Need to find a DIFFERENT hole on 5F (likely near center) to drop into it.
- **Plan**: Go to stairs at (3, 5) to return to 5F, then search for a central hole.
