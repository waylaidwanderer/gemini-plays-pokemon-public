- Plan: Return to Gym and defeat Whitney.
- Strategy: Lead Garnet. Mud-Slap Miltank immediately.
- Inventory: Super Potion x8. Mud-Slap (Learned). Money: ¥351.
- Obstacle: NPC at (11, 7) blocking exit path. Attempting to interact/wait.
- Navigation Lesson: Dept Store 1F has a U-shaped layout blocked by shelves/NPCs at the bottom. Must loop around the top (Row 3) to exit.
- Layout Hypothesis: The exit (SE corner) seems blocked by counters (Row 4) and an NPC (11, 7). Testing if counters are permeable or if there's a specific gap.
- Hypothesis: The 'counters' at (12, 4) might be passable gates. Testing access to SE exit from the North.
