# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement. Passable from SOUTH to NORTH. Found at (4, 20), (16, 10), (8, 34).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at (10, 15).
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- Start Turn: 49771
- Start Time: 3:29 PM

## Strategy: The Sea Route Bypass (Final)
The northern plateau (Row 10-14) is protected by a maze of land walls, but accessible via the northern sea.
1. Surf (12, 28) -> (12, 27). (Completed)
2. Navigate Buoy Maze to (23, 21):
   - Up to (12, 24) (Bypass X=16 wall)
   - Right to (17, 24)
   - Down to (17, 26) (Bypass X=18 wall)
   - Right to (23, 26)
   - Up to (23, 21)
3. Surf North through (23, 15) buoy gap to Row 10.
4. Navigate X=26 Buoy Wall:
   - Right to (27, 10)
   - Up through (27, 9) buoy gap to Row 8.
5. Surf West along Row 8 to (16, 8).
6. Surf South to (16, 12) to land.
7. Walk to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

## Hypotheses
- H1: (19, 21), (23, 15), and (27, 9) are confirmed gaps in the buoy walls.
- H2: (16, 12) is a valid landing point for the northern plateau.
- H3: (14, 10) is the trigger point for the Suicune sighting.

# Progress Notes
- Reached (12, 28) on Turn 49791.
- Note: SUPER REPEL is active.
- Note: Rock at (4, 25) and Wall at (4, 23) block land access to the Western Corridor from the central pool landing.
- Note: (10, 27) Rock blocks westward movement from (11, 27).
- Note: Sea route avoids all land-based maze obstacles.
