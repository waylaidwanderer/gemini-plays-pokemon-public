# Game Mechanics & Learnings

## Navigation & Exploration
- **Mt. Moon B2F Obstacle Solved:** The defeated Rocket Grunt at (16, 23) acts as an impassable obstacle. The path forward is not through or immediately adjacent, but by looping around the entire central rock structure to the right.
- **Defeated Trainers as Obstacles:** Confirmed that defeated trainers act as impassable obstacles. This must be accounted for in all navigation.

## Battle Strategy & Learnings
- **Proactive Tactics:** Don't wait until HP is critical to use priority moves like Quick Attack.
- **Run Efficiency:** If running from a wild battle fails more than twice, it is more efficient to defeat the opponent.
- **Risk Assessment (Paras, Mt. Moon B1F):** Underestimated damage from a Lv. 11 Paras's Absorb. Switching in a low-level, non-resistant Pokémon is too risky for weakening wild encounters.
- **Menu Navigation:** Need to be more precise with button presses during battle to avoid wasted turns. Use of the `menu_navigator_agent` is recommended.
- **Party Order (Mt. Moon):** To make wild encounters more efficient, I will place ECHO (Zubat) at the front of my party to counter the frequent Paras.

## Type Matchup Discoveries
- **Electric vs. Bug/Grass:** Electric-type moves (Thundershock) are 'not very effective' against Paras.

## Long-Term Goals
- Stock up on healing items like Paralyze Heals and Potions at the next Poké Mart to avoid long retreats from dungeons.
