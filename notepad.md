# Global Mechanics
## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement. Allows NORTH movement.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement.
- BUOY: Water wall. Gaps exist at (19, 21), (23, 15), (27, 9).

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- Quest Start: Turn 48900

## Strategy: Outer Sea Surf Bypass
The northern plateau (14, 10) is reached by walking to the Outer Sea (X=23), Surfing North to Row 15, and finding a landing point on the northern shore.

## Execution Plan
1. Move to (23, 32) and Surf into the Outer Sea. <- CURRENT TASK
2. Navigate North to Row 15 and pass through the buoy gap at (23, 15).
3. Navigate West along Row 11-12 to find a landing point near (16, 12).
4. Walk to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune sighting.

## Lessons Learned
- Land paths are heavily restricted by walls and one-way ledges.
- The city is divided into vertical strips; crossing between them requires specific gaps (e.g., Row 33 for X=9).

## Progress Summary
- Turn 49538: Player at (23, 32). Selecting YES to SURF.
