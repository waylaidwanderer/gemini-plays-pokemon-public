- LAPIS (POLIWAG): Lv12 (Waterfall, Surf, Whirlpool)

# Verified Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable from SOUTH (cannot walk north). Represents a ledge face.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump from NORTH to SOUTH.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- FLOOR: Walkable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Traversable only via Surf.
- (11, 14): Dead End Pocket. Wall at (11, 13) and (12, 14) blocks access to the north plateau.
- (11, 15): Gap in the city wall (Y=15). Accesses the beach area but not the plateau.

# Suicune Quest Strategy: 'The Route 41 Bypass'
- Fact: The buoy spiral is a series of vertical barriers (X=26, X=22, X=19, X=17) that are open at the north (Y=0).
- The solution is to use the Route 41 map transition to sail 'over' the walls.
- Route:
    1. Sail to (29, 1) and enter Route 41.
    2. Sail West in Route 41 to the longitude of the landing spot (approx. X=14).
    3. Sail South back into Cianwood City at Y=0.
    4. Land at (14, 10) or (15, 11).
    5. Walk to Suicune at (7, 4).
- Preparation: Lead with XENON (Haunter). Use SUPER REPEL.
- Start Turn: 47680 (Suicune North Beach Quest)

# Strategy Lessons
- Buoy Maze: The buoy spiral is the only intended path. Land routes from the south are blocked by ledge faces (FLOOR_UP_WALL).
- Menu Memory: Items in the pack stay selected. Use the pocket-switch trick to reset cursor.
- Efficiency: Use (19, 30) for launching into the spiral.
