# Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR:** Standard walkable tile.
- **WALL:** Impassable tile.
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN:** One-way jumpable ledge (South).
- **TALL_GRASS:** Wild Pokemon encounters.
- **WATER:** Requires Surf.
- **LADDER:** Walkable (bridge).
- **CUT_TREE:** Requires Cut.
- Found the path to Route 9! It was a gap in the wall at (36, 22), bypassing the cuttable tree.
- Heading East to enter Route 9 and find the Power Plant.
- Route 9 Navigation: The route is split into Upper and Lower paths by ledges and walls. 
- I am currently on the Lower path (Row 8+), which is one-way (East to West or Ledge Down).
- To reach the Youngster and the Grass area (Upper Path), I must enter Route 9 from a different (Northern) entrance in Cerulean City.
- Plan: Return to Cerulean, backtrack up the hidden path, and look for a way East that stays North (around y=12-16).
