# Red Battle Log (Verified via History)
- Start: Turn 43634 (Monday, January 12, 2026 at 10:13 AM PST)
- Pikachu (Lv81): Defeated by GNEISS.
- Espeon (Lv73): Defeated (Turn 43777).
- Snorlax (Lv75): Active. Asleep (Turn 43856 via Rest).
  - Moves: Body Slam, Snore, Rest (7/10), Amnesia. (Haunter is immune to Normal).
- XENON (Haunter): Active. HP 111/111. Dream Eater PP: 0/15.
- GNEISS (Graveler): Benched. HP 24/152. Paralyzed.
- GORP (Snorlax): Benched. HP 141/221.
- Inventory: 4 Full Restores, 8 Max Potions, 18 Revives, 12 Full Heals, 1 Elixer.
- Strategy: Use Night Shade now that Dream Eater PP is gone. XENON is immune to Snorlax's attacking moves. Watch for Amnesia (buffs Special Defense). If Snorlax wakes up, use Night Shade or switch to KIMCHI for Sleep Powder.
- Observation: Snorlax woke up and immediately used Rest again at Turn 43856. It's back to full HP. Continue strategy.
- Note: Night Shade deals fixed 44 damage and ignores Amnesia's Sp.Def buffs. Currently on Turn 6 of sleep (Turn 43862).
- Battle Progress: Snorlax is a complete wall to Haunter; it has no moves that can damage us. This is a safe but slow victory.
