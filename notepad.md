- **WALL:** Impassable.
- **FLOOR:** Traversable.
- **TALL_GRASS:** Traversable, triggers wild encounters.
- **LEDGE:** One-way downward traversal.

### Sprout Tower Layout
- The central pillar divides all floors, making east-west travel impossible on any single floor except the third.
- To navigate the tower, one must ascend on one side, cross over on the third floor, and then descend on the other.

## IV. Future Plans & Untested Hypotheses

- **Hypothesis:** Can Onix learn Flash (HM05)?
- **Hypothesis:** The correct exit path from Sprout Tower is on the east side of the lower floors, accessible by descending from the east side of the third floor.
