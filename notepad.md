### Strategic Reflection (Turn 8719)
- **Status**: Stuck in Goldenrod for ~100 turns.
- **Issue**: Oscillating between East/West without clearing the "fog of war".
- **Insight**: The North-East (Flower Shop) is a cul-de-sac. The Central North Wall seems solid. The only remaining option is the North-West quadrant, which is largely "unseen".
- **Action Plan**: 
    1. Return to Main Street (y=10).
    2. Move West to x=6.
    3.Systematically explore North from there, hugging the West edge.

### Navigation Notes
- **Location**: Goldenrod City (North of Tracks).
- **Goal**: Reach Route 35 Gatehouse (North Exit).
- **Status**: Exploring the area North of the Magnet Train tracks. Currently at (6, 8).
- **Observation**: Row 5 is a wall of buildings from x=5 to x=17.
- **Correction**: x=17 is a vertical wall separating the Flower Shop (East) from the Main Street (West). x=18 leads only to the Flower Shop.
- **Plan**: Backtrack South to y=8, move West to x=16, then head North. x=16 appears to be the correct path to the Gatehouse.

### Map Structure
- **Tracks**: Run East-West around y=13.
- **Gym**: Likely the building at (24, 7).
- **Flower Shop**: North-East cul-de-sac.
- **Barriers**: Row 5 seems to be a significant barrier.
- **Anomalies**: `TYPE_2889` is both path and wall. visual confirmation required.

### Quest Chain: SquirtBottle
1. **Defeat Whitney**: Done (Plain Badge obtained).
2. **Find Floria**: Currently seeking at Route 36.
3. **Get Bottle**: Return to Flower Shop after meeting Floria.
