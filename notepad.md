# Hall of Fame Entry
- **Achievement:** **CHAMPION OF THE JOHTO LEAGUE!**
- **Date:** Turn 33314
- **MVP:** Muscle (Machoke) Lv88.

# Reflection (Turn 35045)
- **Lesson:** Shop inventory varies significantly. Kanto Marts (Viridian/Vermilion) lacked Repels entirely. Goldenrod 2F Bottom Clerk only has standard Repels. Top Clerk appears to be Medicine-focused.
- **Strategy:** If Top Clerk lacks Super/Max Repels, I will compromise and buy standard Repels from the Bottom Clerk to avoid further delays. 
- **Efficiency:** Better to hunt with standard Repels than spend 50 turns finding Super ones.
