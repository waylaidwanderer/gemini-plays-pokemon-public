### Previous Accomplishments

- Note: The path South from (8, 29) leads to an Eastern passage at (8, 35).
- Note: The path South from (2, 29) connects back to the entrance at (3, 42). Confirmed empty.
- Critical Insight: The map is 30 tiles wide. I have only explored the West side (X < 9). I need to explore the East side (X > 9) to find the Farfetch'd.
- Task: Herd Farfetch'd back to the Apprentice.
- Strategy: The bird is at (15, 25). I am at (15, 26).
- Plan: Interact from South -> Bird moves North/East -> Follow it clockwise around the trees to return to the Apprentice.
- Discovery: Mental Map XML indicates tiles (9, 35) and (10, 35) are walkable (TYPE_3fe2). The 'Dead End' marker at (8, 35) is likely incorrect. I must investigate this path.
- Mechanic: Farfetch'd moves away from the player interaction. It resets if pushed into a blocked path or cornered incorrectly.
- Strategy: Herd Farfetch'd South from (15, 25) to Row 28/29, then push West.
- Current Step: Flanking Farfetch'd. Moving East to (29, 28), then North through gap at (29, 25) to loop back to (15, 24).
