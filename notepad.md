# Gym Leader Whitney (Goldenrod City)
- **Roster:**
  - Clefairy (Lv 18): Metronome, DoubleSlap, Encore.
  - Miltank (Lv 20): Stomp, Rollout, Milk Drink, Attract.
- **Observations:**
  - Miltank's Rollout doubles in power each turn.
  - Attract fails against female Pokémon (GNEISS is female).
- **Strategy:**
  - Lead with GNEISS (Geodude). Rock/Ground resists Normal and Rock moves.
  - If Rollout chain reaches Turn 4 or 5, switch to fodder Pokémon (FRITTATA, KIMCHI) to tank the hit and force a reset.
  - Use Magnitude to burst through Milk Drink.
- **Battle Status:** Whitney Defeated.
