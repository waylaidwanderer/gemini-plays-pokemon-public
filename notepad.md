# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Location:** Silver Cave Pokemon Center.
- **Status:** Exiting PC.
- **Action:** Press B to cancel dialogue/menu.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. The screen shows the "Shall we heal?" prompt again, despite the text history indicating healing completed.
  2. I likely re-initiated the interaction or the state is desynced.
  3. Pressing B is the safest way to decline/exit the dialogue loop.
  4. Once free, I will exit the PC and Surf West.
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Heal at PC.
  2. Explore North-West of Silver Cave Outside.
