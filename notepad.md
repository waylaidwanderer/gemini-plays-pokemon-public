# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Walkable.
- WALL: Impassable.

- BOULDER: Stopper for sliding.
- ROCK: Destructible with ROCK SMASH.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable ledge face. Blocks N->S movement.
- LEDGE_HOP_RIGHT: One-way jump West to East.
- LEDGE_HOP_LEFT: One-way jump East to West.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump North to South.
- Warp Pathing: Navigate tool does not automatically avoid warp tiles. Use intermediate coordinates to steer around.
