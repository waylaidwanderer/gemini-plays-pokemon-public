## Strategy for Elite Four
1. **Will (Psychic):** Typhlosion (Return/Flame Wheel) or Haunter (Night Shade). (DEFEATED)
2. **Koga (Poison/Bug):** Typhlosion (Flame Wheel) or Graveler (Earthquake). (DEFEATED)
3. **Bruno (Fighting/Rock):** Haunter (Night Shade/Dream Eater) or Graveler (Earthquake).

## Strategy for Champion Lance (The Wall)
- **Problem:** Dragonites are bulky and hit hard with Outrage/Hyper Beam.
- **Action:** Purchase Full Restores/Max Potions and Revives at Indigo Plateau Mart.
- **Alternative:** Consider catching a Jynx (Ice Path) or Lapras (Union Cave, Friday) for Ice coverage.
- **Alternative:** Use Gneiss (Graveler) with Rollout/Rock moves against Flying types.

## Team Status & Preparation
- Calcifer (Typhlosion, Lv55): Lead attacker. Return/Flame Wheel/Thunderpunch.
- Gneiss (Graveler, Lv51): Physical tank, good for Aerodactyl/Charizard.
- Xenon (Haunter, Lv41): Night Shade/Dream Eater.

## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- LADDER: Traversable. Transition to another map. (Verified at WillsRoom (5, 2)).
- COUNTER: Impassable. Allows interaction from adjacent tiles (e.g. talking to NPCs behind them) but blocks movement.
- WARP_CARPET: Walking off map edge triggers transition. (Verified).

## persistence Knowledge
### Type Effectiveness
- Ice > Dragon/Flying/Grass/Ground (2x or 4x).
- Rock > Flying/Fire/Ice/Bug (2x).
- Electric > Water/Flying (2x).
- Ghost: Immune to Normal/Fighting.
## Lessons Learned
- **TM Compatibility:** Always verify in-game (by trying to use the TM) if a Pokemon can learn a move before basing a long-term strategy on it. Do not rely on cross-generational knowledge.
- **Menu Navigation:** When navigating deep menus (like the Pack pockets), use small button sequences and verify the screen text between turns to avoid getting lost in sub-menus.

## Battle Notes - Will (Psychic)
- **Xatu:** Psychic/Flying. Weak to Electric (Thunderpunch), Rock (Rollout).
- **Jynx:** Psychic/Ice. Weak to Fire (Flame Wheel), Rock (Rollout).
- **Exeggutor:** Psychic/Grass. Weak to Fire (Flame Wheel).
- **Slowbro:** Psychic/Water. Weak to Electric (Thunderpunch).
- **Lead Strategy:** Calcifer (Typhlosion) is the most versatile attacker here. Xenon (Haunter) is risky due to Poison typing vs Psychic moves.

## Battle Notes - Koga (Poison/Bug)
- **Ariados:** Bug/Poison. Weak to Fire (Flame Wheel), Rock (Rollout).
- **Venomoth:** Bug/Poison. Weak to Fire (Flame Wheel), Rock (Rollout).
- **Forretress:** Bug/Steel. Weak to Fire (4x!) (Flame Wheel).
- **Crobat:** Poison/Flying. Weak to Electric (Thunderpunch), Rock (Rollout).
- **Muk:** Poison. Weak to Ground (Earthquake).
## Battle Notes - Bruno (Fighting)
- **Hitmontop:** Fighting. Xenon immune to STAB. Used Dig (Ground). (DEFEATED)
- **Hitmonlee:** Fighting. Xenon immune to STAB (unless Foresight active). Weak to Psychic/Flying.
- **Hitmonchan:** Fighting. Weak to Psychic/Flying. Watch for Elemental Punches (Fire/Ice/Thunder).
- **Onix:** Rock/Ground. 4x weak to Water/Grass. 2x weak to Ground (Earthquake).
- **Machamp:** Fighting. Weak to Psychic/Flying. High physical power.
- **Strategy:** Xenon is primary for Fighting types unless coverage moves are predicted. Gneiss for Onix.
- **Observation:** Hitmonlee uses Foresight to bypass Ghost immunity. Night Shade deals consistent damage.
