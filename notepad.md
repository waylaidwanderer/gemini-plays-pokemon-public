# Reflection (Turn 11689)
- **Execution:** Fly attempt failed (landed back in New Bark Town). Likely map navigation error or input drop.
- **Lesson:** Verify Fly destination text BEFORE pressing A. Do not batch navigation and confirmation in one turn.
- **Hygiene:** Map markers for PC types (Storage vs Research) helped avoid confusion at Elm's Lab.
- **Strategy:** Pivot to step-by-step Fly navigation.

## Current Strategy

- **Secondary Goal:** Investigate Radio Tower (Team Rocket takeover).
- **Navigation:** Flying to Goldenrod City.
- **Status:** Retrying Fly Map Navigation (With Delay).
