### Current Objectives & Strategy
- **Main Quest**: Begin the Gym Challenge (Violet City).
- **Immediate Goal**: Reach Cherrygrove City.
- **Healing**: Mom (New Bark) does NOT heal. Elm did NOT heal. Relied on Berries.
- **Status**: Party HP Critical. Need Pokemon Center.

### Route 29 Navigation Puzzle
- **Problem**: Returned from Cherrygrove via "Ledge Path" (One-way East). Now need to go West.
- **Observations**:
  - **Upper Path (Rows 8-9)**: Seemed to be one-way ledges facing East.
  - **Middle Path (Row 11)**: Blocked by Cut Tree at x=21.
  - **Lower Path (Row 14)**: Dead ends at x=13 (West) and supposedly x=54 (East).
- **Hypothesis**:
  - **A**: The "Ledges" on the Upper Path aren't continuous. There must be a gap I missed.
  - **B**: The "Dead End" on the Lower Path (entering from New Bark) is not a dead end. I need to check the entrance at the South-East corner of Route 29 carefully.
  - **C**: There is a path North of the Ledges (Row 4-5).
- **Plan**:
  1. Check South-East entrance of Route 29 (below the ledge output).
  2. If blocked, check North-East entrance (above the ledge output).
  3. Look closely for gaps in the ledge line.

### Key Locations
- **Cherrygrove City**: Pokemon Center, Mart.
- **Route 30**: Path to Violet City.

### Mechanics
- **Ledges**: Jump South (usually). Or East? Route 29 has specific directional ledges?
- **Cut Trees**: Require Badge 2 + HM01.
- Aide in New Bark Town (after Lab) gives Pokegear tutorial, NOT Potions.
- Confirmed: Must travel to Cherrygrove to heal.
