### Strategic Reflection (Turn 8719)
- **Status**: Stuck in Goldenrod for ~100 turns.
- **Issue**: Oscillating between East/West without clearing the "fog of war".
- **Insight**: The North-East (Flower Shop) is a cul-de-sac. The Central North Wall seems solid. The only remaining option is the North-West quadrant, which is largely "unseen".
- **Action Plan**: 
    1. Return to Main Street (y=10).
    2. Move West to x=6.
    3.Systematically explore North from there, hugging the West edge.

### Navigation Notes
- **Location**: Goldenrod City North.
- **Goal**: Find Route 35 Exit.
- **Status**: Exiting Flower Shop (Map 10_14).
- **Verified Locations**:
    - **Flower Shop**: Entrance at (19, 1). (Current Location)
    - **Name Rater**: Entrance at (15, 7). (Visited)
    - **House (Sister?)**: Entrance at (29, 5). (Visited)
- **Plan**:
    1. Scan the North edge of Goldenrod City (Rows 0-5) for a gap or building.
    2. The exit to Route 35 MUST be on the North wall.
