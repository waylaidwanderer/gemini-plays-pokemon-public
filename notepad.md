# Suicune Quest
- Start Turn (Cianwood Re-attempt): 47450

- Verification (Turn 47562): (11, 15) is the only confirmed land gap to the northern section. Water route is blocked by buoys at Row 15.
- Sighting 1: Burned Tower (DONE)
- Battle Strategy: Use XENON (Haunter) for Hypnosis. Chip HP with fixed damage moves if needed.
