# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Timestamp:** Turn 25784 (Jan 6, 2026)
- **Primary Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Immediate Task:** Explore Silver Cave Room 1 (Northern Section).
- **Sequence:**
    1. Escape the ledge area: South to (4, 11), Jump Ledge to (4, 12).
    2. Navigate East to (8, 12).
    3. Navigate North to (8, 7) (the verified gap).
    4. Continue North to explore unseen area (x=8, y<4).

# Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Acts as a South-facing Ledge (verified). Blocks North movement.
- **Maze Solution:** The path at (8, 18) connects the West and East sections.
- **Navigation Notes:**
    - Wall at (4, 5) blocks direct South movement.
    - Ledges at Row 7 are one-way South. Return path is via x=7 or x=8.
