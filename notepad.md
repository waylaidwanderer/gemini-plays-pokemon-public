## Active Quest: Find Granddaughter
- Started: Turn 37715. Timestamp: Friday, January 9, 2026 at 5:17 PM PST.
- Status: Investigating B1F. Sailor at (30, 6) blocks the corridor at x=30.
- Strategy: Bypass sailor at (30, 6) by moving through (31, 7) -> (31, 6) -> (31, 5). Reach western side via gaps at y=4 or y=5.
- Target: Explore western corridors (x=28 and x=26). Super Nerd at (26, 9) acts as a wall and blocks the corridor at x=26. Target x=28 or x=25.
- Clues: Gentleman (2, 17) on 1F says she's energetic. Sailor at (31, 6) was looking for "lazy bum" buddy. Found buddy at (30, 6).

## Kanto Strategy
