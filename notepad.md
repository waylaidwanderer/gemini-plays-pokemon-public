# Strategy: Suicune Hunt (Crystal)
- Sequence: 1. Burned Tower (Done) -> 2. Cianwood (Done) -> 3. Route 42 Island (Current) -> 4. Route 38 -> 5. Route 14 -> 6. Tin Tower 1F.
- Quest Start: Turn 20970 (Dec 25, 5:00 PM)
- Sighting 3 (Route 42): 
    - Verified in Pokedex at Turn 21303 (Dec 25, 6:58 PM).
    - Status: Visited ALL FLOOR tiles on the island. Sprite did NOT appear.
    - Attempted trigger tiles: (24,14)-(27,14), (25,15)-(30,15), (26,16), (30,16), (26,17)-(30,17).
    - Started Route 42 Island Sweep at Turn 21330.
    - Hypothesis: Specific trigger tile required on the island.
    - Plan: Walk on all island FLOOR tiles. Remaining: None. Re-entering Route 42 from Mt. Mortar (Turn 21349) failed to reset sprite.
    - New Hypothesis: Sighting 3 was triggered earlier (maybe during the Surfing or Cutting) and I missed the animation. Checking Pokedex AREA map to see if it moved to Route 38.
- Lessons Learned:
    - Pokedex Navigation: Alphabetical order check! S is before T. Scroll UP from Togepi to find Suicune.
    - Scripted vs Roaming: Suicune is scripted until Sighting 5. Pokedex "AREA" dot for Suicune is reliable during sightings.
    - Menu Stagnation: Avoid repeatedly checking menus for confirmed information. Trust agents and notepad.
