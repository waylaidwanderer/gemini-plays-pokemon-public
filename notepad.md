# Mt. Moon Exploration Plan

**Core Strategy:** A system update has improved agent reliability. I will now use the `pathfinder_agent` for all navigation.

**Methodology:**
1.  **Identify POIs:** Use the `dungeon_path_analyzer_agent` to get the coordinates of Points of Interest (trainers, items, warps).
2.  **Generate Path:** Use the `pathfinder_agent` to generate a precise path to the desired POI.
3.  **Execute Path:** Follow the agent's path exactly.

# Agent Status & Improvement Plan
- **`pathfinder_agent`:** Now considered the primary tool for navigation due to system updates.
- **`dungeon_path_analyzer_agent`:** Remains useful for identifying POI coordinates to provide to the pathfinder.

# Battle Learnings
- **Type Matchups:**
  - Electric is ineffective vs. Ground (Geodude, Sandshrew).
  - Grass is 4x effective vs. Rock/Ground (Geodude).
  - Electric is NOT very effective vs. Bug/Grass (Paras).
  - Electric is NOT very effective vs. Grass/Poison (Oddish, Bellsprout).
- **Risk Management:** Do not switch in low-level, non-resistant Pok√©mon to weaken wild encounters.

# Dungeon Mechanics
- **Defeated Trainers:** Defeated trainers in Mt. Moon and on Route 3 act as impassable obstacles.
- **Trap Ladder:** The ladder at (26, 16) on 1F is a one-way trap that leads back to 1F. Do not use.
