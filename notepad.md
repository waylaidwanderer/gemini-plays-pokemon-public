# Ice Path Strategy
- **Current Action:** Navigating East-Central Winding Path.
- **Goal:** Follow the corridor West from (26, 12) to find a Ladder to B1F.
- **Reasoning:**
  - North path (Row 10) is blocked by ledges (one-way South).
  - East path (x=31) is a solid wall.
  - West path (Row 14/13) is the only open route.
- **Items:** Item Balls at (32, 23), (35, 9), (31, 7).

# Mechanics & Lessons
- **Ice Physics:** Sliding continues until collision.
- **Ledges:** `FLOOR_UP_WALL` tiles are impassable walls from South.

# Map Structure
- **West:** Entrance (Route 44).
- **Center:** Hub.
- **East:** Winding corridors leading deeper.
