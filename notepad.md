# Strategic Notes
## Objectives
- **Primary:** Reach Indigo Plateau (Money Farming Loop).
- **Secondary:** Defeat Elite Four.
- **Tertiary:** Hunt Roamers (Raikou/Entei) - *Paused*.

## Current Task: Traverse Victory Road 2F (West)
- **Location:** Victory Road 2F (ID: 3_91) at (1, 35).
- **Goal:** Reach East section via Ledge at (3, 34).
- **Reasoning:** 
  - `(1, 49)` on 1F is the only ladder in the South section, so `(1, 35)` on 2F MUST be the entry point.
  - The path forward must be on 2F.
  - `(2, 35)` is a wall, blocking direct East movement.
  - Path must be `(1, 35) -> (3, 33) -> Jump South at (3, 34) -> (3, 35) -> East`.
  - Previous auto-pathing failed at `(3, 34)`. Will attempt manual input to force the jump.

## Status
- **Money:** ¥3294.
- **Party:** Gyarados (Lead), Lugia, Machoke, Pidgey, Oddish, Quilava.
