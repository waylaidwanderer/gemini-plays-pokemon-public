# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Investigate Mahogany Town (Radio Signal).
- **Secondary Goal:** Find Lance in Mahogany Town (likely near Mart).
- **Navigation:** Fly to Mahogany Town.

## Quest Log
- **Lake of Rage:**
    - Caught Red Gyarados (QAAGMAQNJW).
    - Met Lance. He revealed a radio broadcast from Mahogany Town is forcing Magikarp to evolve.
    - Lance is heading to Mahogany to investigate.
- **Goldenrod:**
    - Basement of Dept Store is accessible? Need to check Underground.
- **Deliveries:**
    - Kenya (Spearow) with Mail -> Route 31 Fisher (Failed).

## Team Management
- **Party:** Muscle (42), Garnet (28), Lapis (12), Mistral (13), Kenya (11), Belladonna (5).
- **Box 1:** Red Gyarados (30).
- **Idea:** Swap a weak member (Belladonna/Kenya) for Red Gyarados (Water/Flying) for better power?
    - Note: Gyarados overlaps type with Lapis (Water) and Mistral/Kenya (Flying).
    - But it's Level 30. Huge immediate boost.

## World Knowledge
- **Mahogany Town:** Suspicious Mart with locked stairs. Lance's destination.
- **Lake of Rage:** Red Scale obtained (Trade to Mr. Pokemon?).

## Mechanics
- **Fly:** Cycles towns.
- **Hidden Items:** Check suspicious tiles.

## Global Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WARP_CARPET: Map transition.
- STAIRS: Change floor.
- Fly Map Mechanics:
    - 'Up'/'Down' cycles through the town list in Johto order: New Bark -> Cherrygrove -> Violet -> Azalea -> Goldenrod -> Ecruteak -> Olivine -> Cianwood -> Mahogany -> Lake of Rage.
    - 'Left'/'Right' is inconsistent.
- Phone Call (Wade): "The Bug-Catching Contest is at the NATIONAL PARK today." (Note: Current day is Sunday, but contest is usually Tue/Thu/Sat. Verify if possible.)
- Plan: Talk to Gramps at (20, 26), then Surf to find Red Gyarados.
- Battle Strat: Use Muscle's Rock Smash (Not Very Effective) to weaken Gyarados safely.
- Gramps Dialogue: "The GYARADOS are angry! It's a bad omen!"
- Next Step: Surf onto the lake and locate the Red Gyarados.
- Gyarados Battle Plan:
  1. Lead with Muscle (Machoke, Lvl 42).
  2. Use Rock Smash (Fighting vs Water/Flying = Not Very Effective).
  3. Whittle HP to Red.
  4. Throw Great Balls (have 10).
  5. Backup: Lapis/Lucid for Hypnosis if desperate (risk of OHKO).
- Battle Started against Red Gyarados!
- Turn 1: Advancing intro text.
- Strategy reminder: Weaken with Rock Smash (Muscle), then throw Great Balls.
- Battle Log:
  - Turn 2: Muscle used Dig (Immune). Gyarados used Dragon Rage (40 dmg). Muscle HP: 57/137.
  - Turn 3 Plan: Use Strength (Neutral damage). Rock Smash was too weak. Dig is useless.
  - Risk: Dragon Rage leaves Muscle at 17 HP next turn. Must Heal or Switch soon.
  - Turn 3: Muscle used Strength (Neutral). Gyarados used Leer (Def fell). Muscle HP: 57/137. Gyarados HP: ~40% (Yellow).
  - Turn 4 Plan: Throw Great Ball. Muscle can survive one more Dragon Rage (40 dmg), but risky. Catching now is priority.
- Milestone: Caught Red Gyarados! (Nickname: "QAAGMAQNJW" - attempted "Ragnarok", typos happened).
- Obtained Red Scale.
- Plan: Find Lance at the lake shore (likely near the sign at 21, 27) to proceed.
- Interaction: Speaking to Lance (21, 28). Text "This lake is full of GYARADOS but..." appeared.
