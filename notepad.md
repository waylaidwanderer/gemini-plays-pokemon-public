# Ice Path Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Reach Blackthorn City.
- **Status:** Escaping Ice Trap to (13, 16).
- **Next Step:** One final test of the "South Ledges" hypothesis at (8, 18). If that fails, I must commit to the "East Corridor" route (via x=30) which requires solving the main ice puzzle again.
- **East Corridor Route:** (13, 17) -> Solve to (20, 23) -> Go to (30, 12) -> South to (28, 19) -> South to unexplored area.

# Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR:** Walkable.
- **WALL:** Impassable.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Acts as a SOLID WALL at (7, 18), (14, 22), (20, 24). Likely all of Row 18 is blocked.
- **ICE:** Slides player until collision.

# Key Log
- **Turn 16388:** Escaping ice loop.
- **Turn 16386:** Confirmed (30, 12) leads South.
- **Turn 16381:** Row 18 ledges confirmed impassable (at x=7).
- **Turn 16375:** Reached dead end at (25, 11).
