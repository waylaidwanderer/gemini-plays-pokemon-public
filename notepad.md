# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Deposit a Pokemon to receive Dratini.

# Current Status (Turn 18372)
- **Location:** Dragon's Den 1F (3, 3).
- **Action:** Exiting Dragon's Den.
- **Reasoning:** 
    - Warped from the back ladder to the main entrance ladder (3, 3).
    - The exit to Blackthorn City is directly south at (3, 5).
- **Goal:** Exit to Blackthorn City, then Deposit Pokemon.

# Plan
1. Move South to Exit (3, 5).
2. Enter Blackthorn City.
3. Locate and Enter Pokémon Center.
4. Deposit Swinub or Sneasel.
5. Return to Dragon Shrine (via B1F Whirlpool route or just talk to Clair?).
   - *Note:* If I exit, I might have to go all the way back through the Den.
   - *Check:* Does Clair give the Dratini, or the Elder? The Elder does. So I must return to the Shrine.
