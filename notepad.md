## Suicune Quest Log (Crystal Version)
- Prerequisites: Clear Bell (Obtained).
- Quest Start: Turn 24182.
- Sequence:
  1. Burned Tower (Flee event): REQUIRED. Verify beasts are gone from B1F.
  2. Cianwood City North (Flee event): COMPLETE. Eusine defeated (Turn 21034).
  3. Route 42 sighting: REQUIRED. Target: (26, 15). Approach from the water/south.
  4. Route 36 sighting: REQUIRED. Target: (35, 9). Approach from the north or east.
  5. Wise Trio Battle: Gaku, Masa, Koji. Location: Wise Trio Room (Map 4_2).

## Strategy for Wise Trio Battle
- Sages: Gaku, Masa, Koji.
- Pokémon: Noctowl (Lv32) and Kadabra (Lv32).
- Strategy: Lead Calcifer (Typhlosion) with Thunderpunch.
- Note: Sages will ONLY battle once all Suicune sightings are flagged.

## Tile Mechanics - Global
- **FLOOR**: Standard walkable tile. Traversable.
- **WALL / VOID / HEADBUTT_TREE**: Impassable terrain.
- **WATER**: Traversable via SURF.
- **CUT_TREE**: Requires CUT to clear.
- **LEDGE_HOP / LEDGE**: One-way traversal (jump). Impassable from most directions.
- **DOOR / STAIRS / LADDER**: Warp tiles.
- **WARP_CARPET**: Map transition tile.

## General Lessons Learned
- **Sequential Events:** Legendary beast sightings are strictly sequential.
- **Verification:** An empty location does NOT mean a sighting is complete. The event must be triggered by approaching the specific coordinates.
- **Sage Passage:** Passing the gatehouse sage does NOT mean sightings are complete; it only means you have the Clear Bell (or Eusine is defeated). The Trio inside is the final check.
- **Dialogue Triggers:** "The Tin Tower shook!" is NOT proof of sighting completion. It likely only requires the Clear Bell.

## Suicune Sighting Troubleshooting
- Current Task: Verify Burned Tower B1F flee event.
- Status: Wise Trio Room (4_2) is empty, meaning sightings are NOT complete.
- Hypothesis: One of the early sightings (Burned Tower or Cianwood) didn't register or a secondary NPC trigger is missing.
- To Do:
  - Visit Burned Tower B1F and confirm the three beasts are gone.
  - Talk to all NPCs in Ecruteak Dance Theater.
  - Re-visit Route 42 (26, 15) and Route 36 (35, 9) and walk on every adjacent tile.
  - If triggered, Suicune should flee and Eusine should appear nearby.
