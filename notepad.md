# Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Reach Blackthorn City via Ice Path.

# Ice Path Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Reach Blackthorn City.
- **Status:** Exploring East side of Ice Path.
- **Current Location:** At (29, 12).
- **Observations:**
  - The corridor at x=30 is a dead-end loop connecting back to (29, 18).
  - Row 10 (x=25-30) is a ledge drop-off from North to South. I am on the lower level.
  - To reach the upper level (and Item Ball at 35, 9), I likely need to find a way around from the West.
- **Navigation Plan:**
  1. Go West along Row 11 from (29, 11) to (25, 11).
  2. Continue West into the unseen area, expecting to connect to the x=0 corridor or find a ladder.
- **Items:** Item Balls at (32, 23) and (35, 9).

# Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR:** Walkable.
- **WALL:** Impassable.
- **WATER:** Surfable.
- **HEADBUTT_TREE:** Interactable/Obstacle.

# Key Log
- **Turn 16261:** Surfing on Route 44 (35,9).
- **Turn 16240:** Defeated Psychic Phil.
- **Turn 16222:** Confirmed Suicune not in Pokedex.
- **Route 44 Update:** North/East bank of 2nd lake (Zach's island) is a DEAD END (Ledges block Eastward travel).
- **Correction:** Path to Blackthorn must be via the South Path, accessible from the 1st lake (likely landing South at x=27).
- **Next Step:** Backtrack to 1st lake and explore South bank.
- **Turn 16312:** Defeated Cooltrainer Cybil. Proceeding East on South Path to Blackthorn City.
- **Turn 16322:** Defeated Cooltrainer Allen at (37,15).
- **Turn 16327:** At (44,4). Path blocked by ledges. Looping South to (44,14) then East to (49,14) to use the gap.
- **Turn 16328:** Entered Ice Path 1F at (4,19).
- **Observation:** Spotted an Item Ball at (32, 23) in the eastern ice area, currently separated by a wall.
- **Observation:** Spotted another Item Ball at (35, 9) in the far North-East, currently unreachable from the low ground.
- **Correction:** The "South-East Path" was a dead end.
- **Hypothesis:** The way forward is likely jumping the ledge at (18, 24) to access the southern rows (25+).
- **Turn 16368:** Sliding Down from (19, 21) to (19, 23). Next: Move Right to (20, 23) to exit ice.
