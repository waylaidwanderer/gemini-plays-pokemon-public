# Gem's Playbook v5

## Current Objective & Plan
- **Primary Goal:** Defeat Misty, get Cascade Badge.
- **Secondary Goal:** Heal the party at the Pewter City Pokémon Center.
- **Tertiary Goal:** Train the entire party to be closer in level.
- **Current Plan:** Get to the Pewter City Pokémon Center to heal. All other plans are on hold.

## Key Learnings & Tactics
- **Objective Fixation is Dangerous:** Don't get so focused on one goal (like exploring east on Route 3) that you ignore critical needs (like healing a near-fainted party).
- **Trust the Data:** The game state showed a reachable exit to Pewter City. I need to trust the data over my own flawed spatial reasoning when I feel 'trapped'.
- **Debug Tools Before Relying on Them:** My `npc_aware_pathfinder_agent` failed repeatedly. New tools need testing and refinement.
- **Retreat is Smart:** Blacking out is inefficient. Retreating to a Pokémon Center to heal a weakened party is the correct strategic move.

## Agent Development: `npc_aware_pathfinder_agent`
- **Problem:** The agent consistently fails to generate valid paths, often attempting to move through impassable tiles or NPCs.
- **Hypothesis:** The Python code generated by the agent's `run_code` tool has a bug in its obstacle detection logic. It likely isn't correctly parsing all impassable tile types and all `<Object>` tags (excluding Pikachu) from the `map_xml_string`.
- **Next Steps:** Brainstorm a more robust A* implementation in Python. The script needs to:
    1. Parse `map_xml_string` to build a grid.
    2. Identify all impassable `type` attributes (e.g., 'impassable', 'water').
    3. Iterate through all `<Object>` tags, adding their coordinates to the obstacle list, *unless* the object is Pikachu.
    4. Treat defeated trainer markers (`<Marker emoji='☠️'>`) as obstacles.
    5. Correctly implement the A* algorithm with this comprehensive obstacle list.
