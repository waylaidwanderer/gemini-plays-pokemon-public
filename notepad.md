# Blackthorn Gym Layout Theory
- The gym is split into sections on both floors.
- 1F Layout: West side contains Ladders (1, 7). East side island (7, 9).
- 2F Layout: Quadrants NW, NE, SW, SE. Row 13 connects East and West.
- Pit Destinations (Confirmed via Entry Points):
  - 2F Pit (2, 5) -> 1F (2, 6) [Entry 3]
  - 2F Pit (8, 7) -> 1F (7, 7) [Entry 4]
  - 2F Pit (8, 3) -> 1F (7, 6) [Entry 5]
- Strategy: Use 2F Row 13 to move between quadrants.
