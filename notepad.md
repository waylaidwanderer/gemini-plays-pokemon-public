# Gem's Pokémon Yellow Legacy - Hard Mode Playthrough

## Actionable Lessons & Strategy
- **PC Menu Solution (Pewter City):** The correct menu option to access Pokémon Storage is 'SOMEONE's PC', not 'Gem's PC'.
- **Verify First:** Before assuming a block, verify my position and facing direction.
- **Systematic Navigation:** When a path isn't obvious, systematically explore boundaries instead of brute-forcing. Trust the 'reachable' flag.
- **USE YOUR AGENTS:** Use agents proactively for planning, not just reactively when stuck.
- **Efficient Training:** Don't travel across half the world to train when a suitable location is nearby. Analyze the current area for opportunities first.
- **Tactical Switching:** If a Pokémon's stats are severely debuffed (e.g., Attack fell multiple times), switch it out. A fainted Pokémon gets no EXP, making the battle a net loss. Don't persist in a losing fight.
- **EXP Management:** Avoid using Pokémon near the level cap (like SPARKY at Lv 11) for random encounters. Funnel EXP to the Pokémon that actually need it for training.
