## Core Principles & Strategy
- **Immediate Execution:** Perform tasks the moment they are identified.
- **Scientific Method:** Observe -> Hypothesize -> Test -> Conclude.
- **Efficiency:** Running from wild battles is preferred unless training or catching.
- **Menu Verification:** Use short button sequences (1-5 presses) and verify screen state. Long sequences (20+) are prone to failure due to menu memory.

## Menu Mechanics
- **Start Menu Order (from top):**
  1. POKEDEX
  2. POKEMON
  3. PACK
  4. POKEGEAR
  5. GEM (Player Name)
  6. SAVE
  7. OPTION
  8. EXIT
- **Cursor Memory:** The Start menu and party menu remember the last cursor position.
- **Pokegear Radio:** Frequency 20.0 (Poke Flute) is at the top of the dial in Kanto. Requires EXPN Card.

## Party Management
- **Lead Pokémon:** Calcifer (TYPHLOSION Lv58).
- **XENON (Haunter):** Target lead for Snorlax (Normal immunity, Hypnosis).

## Snorlax Quest Phase
- Goal: Wake Snorlax at Vermilion City / Route 11 junction.
- Start Turn: 40317.
- Interaction tile: (36, 8) facing Left.
- Method: Use Pokegear Radio (Frequency 20.0 - Poke Flute) to wake him.
- Current Status: Overworld, facing Snorlax. Radio not yet on Poke Flute.
- Step 1: Open Pokegear Radio (Start, A).
- Step 2: Tune needle to 20.0 (top center) using Up presses until "POKE FLUTE" appears.
- Step 3: Exit menu (B, B), face Left, and interact with Snorlax (A).

## General Lessons & Error Log
- **Dialogue Boxes:** Close dialogue boxes before attempting movement or menuing.
- **Start Menu Wrap:** The menu wraps around (Up from POKEDEX -> EXIT).
- **Select Button:** In party menu, use Select to swap positions. In overworld, Select can use a registered item.
