# Strategy: The Suicune Pursuit
- **Objective:** Trigger Suicune sighting at (14, 10) in northern Cianwood.
- **Eusine Battle Prep:** Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25). Strategy: Lead with Lv64 Calcifer. Sweep with Flamethrower/Thunderpunch.
- **Current Plan (The Grand Loop):**
  1. Land at (27, 44) and move West to (18, 44).
  2. Move South through the gap at (18, 46) to Row 47.
  3. Move West to (6, 47) and then South to Row 51.
  4. Move West to (2, 51) and then North via the X=2 corridor.
  5. Sighting at (14, 10).
- **Verification:** X=18 (Row 46) and X=6 (Row 50) are the only gaps that allow South movement past the cliffs.
- **Land Route:** X=2 corridor is clear of Terrace Climbs and Ledges from Row 51 to Row 10.

# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Standard traversable terrain.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable terrain.
- WATER: Traversable only with Surf.
- DOOR / WARP_CARPET: Map transition points.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump down (South). Blocks North.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL (Terrace Climb): One-way barrier. Allows North movement, blocks South.
- ROCK (Object): Blocks movement; cleared with Rock Smash. Respawns upon map transition.

# Area Notes: Cianwood City
- **Barriers:** Row 15 is a solid wall/buoy barrier from X=3 to X=22, EXCEPT for a gap at (11, 15). Row 13 is solid at X=11, making (11, 15) a dead end.
- **Shortcut Tiles:** (5, 29), (4, 25) (Smashed Rocks).
- **Terrace Climbs:** (4, 30), (6, 34), (6, 46), (21, 46), (8, 48), (12, 50). All block South movement.

# Lessons Learned
- **Time Check:** Attempting sighting since Turn #50620.
- **Verification:** X=2 corridor confirmed clear of Terrace Climbs and Ledges in Mental Map.
