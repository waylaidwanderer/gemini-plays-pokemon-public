# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
- **Start Turn:** 49885
- **Current Status:** Exiting Poke Seer's House after accidental entry. New route: Use the X=11 gap to reach the plateau.

## Tool Notes
- `find_path_v8` failure: The tool incorrectly routed through the warp at (5, 17) in Cianwood City. Future paths must be manually checked for warps on the current map.

## New Strategy: The X=11 Gap
1. Exit house to (5, 18).
2. Walk East to (11, 18).
3. Walk North to (11, 14).
4. Walk West to (8, 14).
5. Walk North to (8, 12).
6. Walk East to (14, 12).
7. Walk North to Suicune (14, 10).

## Active Strategy: The Western Highway (X=2)
Investigation reveals that X=2 is a clear land corridor from Row 51 all the way to Row 10, bypassing most island obstacles.

### The Path to Suicune
1. Navigate to (18, 44) via the gap between buildings at X=18. (In Progress)
2. Walk West along Row 44 to (2, 44).
3. Walk North along X=2 to Row 12 at (2, 12).
4. Walk East along Row 12 to (14, 12).
5. Walk North to trigger Suicune at (14, 10).

## Verified Mechanics & Obstacles
- Row 44: A clear horizontal corridor across the island (X=2 to X=19).
- X=18 Gap: A vertical opening between buildings at (17, 47) and (19, 47).
- Western Corridor: X=0-2 is clear of major blockages from Row 44 to Row 10.
- Plateau Entry: Row 12 is clear at X=14, allowing access to the Suicune spot.

## Battle Plan: Eusine
