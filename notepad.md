# Kanto Campaign Status
- **Location:** Cerulean Pokemon Center.
- **Current Objective:** Reach the Power Plant via Route 9.
- **Immediate Task:** Exit Menu (B x6), Face Right (to tree), Re-enter Menu (Start, Up, A), Select Belladonna (Down x4 from Garnet), and Cut (A, A).
- **Observation:** Previous attempt failed to select Belladonna because cursor started at Slot 4 (Kunai) instead of Slot 1, and I incorrectly assumed the starting position. I ended up on Garnet.
- **Correction:** Exiting menu now should save cursor on Garnet (Slot 2). To reach Belladonna (Slot 6), I need exactly 4 Downs. Also ensuring I face the tree first.

   - Investigate Power Plant (East of Cerulean, end of Route 9).
