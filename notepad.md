# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Reach the Dragon Shrine via the West Whirlpool.

# Current Status (Turn 18316)
- **Location:** Dragon's Den B1F (12, 10).
- **Action:** Navigate South-West to explore around the Buoy barrier.
- **Reasoning:** 
    - The path South at x=12 is blocked by Buoys at Row 16.
    - I need to find a way around them, likely to the West (x < 12).
    - Navigating to (11, 14) will reveal the area and potentially a path South.
- **Goal:** Reach the West Whirlpool at (15, 23).
- **Immediate:** Reveal tiles at (11, 15) and (11, 16).

# Plan
1. Move to (11, 14).
2. Check if (11, 16) is passable.
3. If passable, continue South to (15, 22).
4. Interact with Whirlpool at (15, 23).

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Obstacle.
- **Buoy:** Obstacle.
- **West Channel:** Needs exploration West of x=12.

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Requires HM06 Whirlpool + Glacier Badge. 
- **Lava/Magma:** (None here).
- **Ice:** (None here).

# Lessons
- **Menu Navigation:** Always verify cursor position before committing to a sequence. Blind input leads to wrong menus (e.g., PACK instead of POKEMON).
