# Mechanics & State

- **Goal:** Encounter Raikou/Entei.
- **Map Transition Latency:** All map transitions (Warps, Fly, Borders) require massive delays (8s+ load) to prevent input swallowing. Critical for automation.
- **Roamer Hunt:** Scramble positions by moving between Ecruteak and Route 37.

# Hall of Fame & Progress
- **Champion:** Turn 33314.
- **Lugia:** Caught (Maelstrom).
- **All 16 Badges:** Obtained.
- **Red:** Defeated.

# Important Locations
- **Route 37:** Contains Red, Blue, and Black Apricorns.
- **Ecruteak City:** Pokemon Center, Tin Tower, Burned Tower.

# Current Task: Roamer Hunt (Raikou/Entei)
- **Start Turn:** 37586
- **Last Reset:** 37974
- **Location:** Route 37 (Grass).
- **Goal:** Register in Pokedex -> Track on Map.
- **Status:** Fly Map Open.
- **Action:** Navigating Fly Map cursor.
- **Current Position:** New Bark Town.
- **Destination:** Goldenrod City.
- **Plan:** Execute Left x3 to reach Ecruteak. Verify text. Then Down to Goldenrod.
- **Reason:** Previous attempts faced input drops. Map is now fully open, so inputs should register. Using 2000ms delays.

# Tools & Automation
- **perform_grass_scan(num_steps):** Automates walking back and forth in grass.
- **Map Navigation Note:** Standard button presses failed to move the Fly cursor from New Bark Town. Suspect input speed issue. Testing with delays.
- **Reflection (Turn 38054):** Addressed stuck Fly map state. Previous inputs ignored. Using `navigate_fly_map` with 500ms delays to ensure registration. Goal: New Bark -> Ecruteak (Left x3) -> Goldenrod.
- **Map Navigation Strategy:** Resetting cursor by closing/reopening map (B -> A). Assuming start at Ecruteak, Down -> Goldenrod.
- **Fly Navigation:** Retrying Fly from Silver Cave. Step 1: Open Map. Step 2: Navigate Left (West) to Johto.
- **Correction:** Previous attempts to move cursor from Silver Cave failed. Testing if map is responding or if Silver Cave is isolated.
- **Fly Navigation:** Dead reckoning suggests cursor is at Ecruteak (Silver Cave -> Leftx3 -> New Bark -> Leftx3 -> Ecruteak).
- **Next Step:** Press Down to select Goldenrod. Verify destination before confirming.
- **Fly Navigation:** Attempting rigorous sequence: B (Reset) -> A (Open) -> Left x4 -> Down x1. Target: Goldenrod.
- **Reason:** Previous dead reckoning was inconsistent. Hard reset ensures known starting point (Silver Cave).
- **Fly Logic Correction:** Previous failure was due to cursor being on 'STATS' in submenu.
- **Current Plan:** Up (to FLY) -> A (Open Map) -> Left x4 (to Ecruteak) -> Down (to Goldenrod) -> A (Execute).
- **Assumed Starting Point:** Silver Cave (Current Location).
- **Diagnosis (Turn 38073):** "Can't use that here" caused by input drop. Cursor landed on Garnet (Slot 4) instead of Mistral (Slot 6). Attempted Rock Smash.
- **Fix:** From Garnet, press Down x2 to reach Mistral. Then Fly. Using 1000ms delays.
- **Fly Map Status:** Map opened. Cursor confirmed at **New Bark Town** (Text: "Where? NEW BARK TOWN").
- **Navigation Plan:** Left x3 (New Bark -> Cherrygrove -> Violet -> Ecruteak). Then Down x1 (Goldenrod).
- **Current Action:** Executing Left x3 with 1s delays.
- **Turn 38076 Update:** Previous navigation inputs were consumed by map load lag. Map is now fully open at New Bark Town. Retrying Left x3 to Ecruteak.
- **Turn 38077 Test:** Previous Left x3 failed to update text from "NEW BARK TOWN". Testing single 'Left' with 2000ms delay to confirm control. Expecting "CHERRYGROVE CITY".
- **Turn 38078 Strategy:** Hard Reset of Fly Map.
- **Sequence:** B (Close) -> A (Open @ Silver Cave) -> Left x5 (Indigo -> New Bark -> Cherrygrove -> Violet -> Ecruteak).
- **Goal:** Verify cursor lands on Ecruteak City. Then move to Goldenrod.
- **Turn 38079 Analysis:** Previous failure was due to inputs executing in the submenu (FLY selected) instead of the map.
- **Current Action:** Press 'A' to open map, then 'Left' x3 with 1.5s delays.
- **Goal:** Determine cursor start position (Silver Cave or New Bark?) and travel distance.
- **Turn 38080 Status:** Map confirmed open at New Bark Town.
- **Action:** Executing navigation sequence: Left x3 (to Ecruteak) -> Down x1 (to Goldenrod).
- **Protocol:** Verify destination text is "GOLDENROD CITY" before pressing 'A' in next turn.
- **Turn 38081 Strategy:** Map text stuck on "SILVER CAVE" (Current Location). Previous navigation failed to update text.
- **Action:** Hard Reset (B -> A). Probe with Left x2 (Target: Indigo/New Bark).
- **Hypothesis:** 1000ms delay might have been insufficient or inputs dropped. Increased to 1500ms.
- **Goal:** confirm cursor movement away from Silver Cave.
- **Turn 38082 Correction:** Previous turn failed because I was in the submenu.
- **Action:** Press 'A' (Select FLY) -> Wait -> Left x2.

- **Delay:** 1500ms.
- **Goal:** Verify "GOLDENROD CITY" text next turn.
- **Turn 38087 Update:** Map is open at Silver Cave. Previous inputs failed to move cursor (suspect timing).

- **Hypothesis:** Map is now fully loaded and should accept inputs.
- **Target:** Ecruteak City (or at least move away from Silver Cave).
- **Turn 38088 Diagnosis:** Intermediate state shows MENU is still open with FLY selected. Map is NOT active yet.
- **Correction:** Press 'A' to open Map. Then navigate.
- **Action:** A (Open) -> Wait 2s -> Left (Move) -> Wait 2s.
- **Goal:** Verify cursor moves out of Silver Cave.
- **Turn 38089 Strategy:** Restarting Fly procedure from Overworld.

- **Turn 38094:** Previous attempt to navigate Fly map (Left x4 with 1000ms) failed to change text from Silver Cave.
- **Hypothesis:** Input drops or lag.
- **Action:** Executing Hard Reset of Fly Map (B -> A) to refresh UI state, then Left x3.
- **Sequence:** B (Close Map) -> A (Select FLY from menu) -> Left x3 (Move cursor).
- **Target:** New Bark Town / Cherrygrove area.
- **Turn 38095:** Correction - Map was NOT open. Menu cursor was on 'FLY'.
- **Action:** Pressing 'A' to open map, then 'Left' x3.
- **Goal:** Open map and navigate cursor to Cherrygrove City (Silver Cave -> Indigo -> New Bark -> Cherrygrove).
- **Hypothesis:** Previous inputs failed because map wasn't open. Opening it now should work.
- **Turn 38096:** Map confirmed at **New Bark Town**.
- **Observation:** Previous command sent 3 Lefts, but cursor only moved 2 steps (Silver -> Indigo -> New Bark). The 3rd Left was swallowed.
- **Action:** Executing navigation from New Bark to Goldenrod.
- **Path:** Left (Cherrygrove) -> Left (Violet) -> Left (Ecruteak) -> Down (Goldenrod).
- **Tool:** `press_sequence_with_delays` with 1500ms delay.
- **Goal:** Verify "GOLDENROD CITY" text next turn.
- **Turn 38097:** Map text reverted to "SILVER CAVE" despite previous turn showing "NEW BARK TOWN".

- **Goal:** Verify text "ECRUTEAK CITY". Next turn: Down to Goldenrod.
- **Note:** Splitting the navigation to Goldenrod into two turns to ensure accuracy (Navigation to Ecruteak, then Down).
- **Turn 38100:** Map STUCK at "NEW BARK TOWN".
- **Observation:** `Left` x3 with 2000ms delay produced NO movement (Text remained "NEW BARK TOWN" in all frames).
- **Hypothesis:** Cursor might be desynced or map state is glitchy.
- **Action:** "Jiggle" strategy. Press `Right` (to Indigo/Wall) then `Left` x4.
- **Goal:** Unstick cursor and reach Violet/Ecruteak.
- **Delay:** 2500ms. High delay to force registration.
- **Turn 38101:** Map STUCK at "NEW BARK TOWN".
