# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement (acting as a ledge). Passable from SOUTH to NORTH.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at Row 15 (X=3-17).
- ROCK: Smashable rocks act as WALLs.
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
## Strategy: Verified Land Route (The S-Curve)
Reach (14, 10) by navigating internal corridors to bypass all obstacles.
1. Surf South to (24, 33) and land at (20, 33).
2. Move West along Row 33 to (2, 33) (The Row 33 Highway).
3. Move North along X=2 to (2, 12) (Bypasses Row 15 ledge).
4. Move East along Row 12 to (14, 12) and North to (14, 10).

# Progress Notes
- Blocked: Row 25 buoy wall at X=21-23. Gap at X=24.
- Blocked: All land routes (X=12, X=6, X=4) are blocked by internal walls or SOUTH-blocking ledges.
- Verified: Row 33 is a clear horizontal path across all internal walls (X=3, 5, 9, 11, 17, 20).
- Verified: X=2 corridor is clear from Row 33 to Row 12.
- Verified: Row 12 is a clear horizontal path from X=2 to X=14.
