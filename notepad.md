# Blackthorn Gym (Puzzle Progress)
- Start Turn: 34501
- Pits (2F): P1 (8, 3), P2 (2, 5), P3 (8, 7).
- Boulders (2F): B6 (3, 3), B7 (6, 1), B8 (8, 11).
- Floor Reset: Using a ladder or falling into a pit resets all boulder positions on 2F.
- Push Mechanic: Player stays in the same tile after pushing a boulder.

# Verified Obstacles
- (5, 10), (5, 12), (6, 6), (8, 9), (9, 12), (9, 13) are WALLs (pillars).
- Fran (4, 11) is an impassable NPC.
- Cody (4, 1) is likely impassable.

# Connectivity & Hypotheses
- (4, 13) is a FLOOR (4-way intersection).
- (7, 11) is labeled WALL (pillar). Testing passability now.
- If (7, 11) is floor, B8 can be pushed Right into column 9.
- Column 9 is clear from row 11 to row 5.

# Strategy: Blackthorn Gym 2F
- Step 1: Test passability of (7, 11).
- Step 2: Test passability of Cody (4, 1).
- Step 3: Determine boulder-to-pit assignments based on connectivity.

# Resource Locations
- Route 45: Good training spot for Haunter (Night Shade).
