# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Navigation Notes
- **Location**: Goldenrod City (South-West).
- **Goal**: Find the path North (likely between x=10 and x=15).
- **Current Action**: Repositioning to search the Central-East corridor.
- **Reasoning**: The West side (x=0-9) and Far East side (x=16+) are blocked at Row 21. The Underground connects SW to SE only. The gap North MUST be in the x=10-15 range, possibly along the Department Store.
- **Plan**: Move South to clear obstacles, then East to x=12, then North.

### Resource Alert
- **Pokeballs**: 10 Poké Balls, 1 Lure Ball.
