### Strategic Reflection (Turn 8719)
- **Status**: Stuck in Goldenrod for ~100 turns.
- **Issue**: Oscillating between East/West without clearing the "fog of war".
- **Insight**: The North-East (Flower Shop) is a cul-de-sac. The Central North Wall seems solid. The only remaining option is the North-West quadrant, which is largely "unseen".
- **Action Plan**: 
    1. Return to Main Street (y=10).
    2. Move West to x=6.
    3.Systematically explore North from there, hugging the West edge.

### Navigation Notes
- **Location**: Goldenrod City (South-Central).
- **Goal**: Reach North-West Quadrant (Route 35 Exit).
- **Status**: At (9, 14) (South of Tracks).
- **Plan**: 
    1. Navigate West to Radio Tower (5, 16).
    2. Check for track crossing at x<6.
    3. If blocked, backtrack to East Crossing (18, 14), cross North, then travel ALL the way West on the North side (Row 7).
- **Realization**: I previously explored the North-West only up to x=6 and stopped. The exit is likely further West (x=0-5).

### Quest Chain: SquirtBottle
1. **Defeat Whitney**: Done (Plain Badge obtained).
2. **Find Floria**: Currently seeking at Route 36.
3. **Get Bottle**: Return to Flower Shop after meeting Floria.

### Key Locations
- **Game Corner**: (9, 5).
- **Radio Tower**: (5, 16).
- **East Crossing**: (18, 14).
- **Potential Exit**: (4, 0).
