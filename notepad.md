## Global Game Mechanics
### Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR:** Walkable. Standard movement.
- **WALL:** Impassable.
- **PIT / HOLE:** Traversable warp. Falling in warps player to the floor below. Essential for some puzzles.
- **INVISIBLE_FLOOR (Ecruteak Gym):** Traversable only on specific tiles. Stepping on the wrong tile warps player to start. Safe path must be discovered.
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN:** Walkable only from the tile directly above. Acts as a WALL from all other directions. Automatically jumps the player down one tile.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Visual ledge that acts as a solid WALL. Cannot be jumped over. Treat as an obstacle.
- **HEADBUTT_TREE:** Impassable. Treated as a solid obstacle.
- **TALL_GRASS / LONG_GRASS:** Walkable. Contains wild Pokémon encounters.
- **WARP_CARPET (DOWN/UP/LEFT/RIGHT):** Walk 'off' the map edge in the direction of the carpet to exit. Merely standing on the tile is insufficient.
- **DOOR / LADDER / STAIRS / CAVE:** Walk onto to warp to a new area or floor.
- **COUNTER:** Impassable. Interact with NPCs from the adjacent tile facing the counter.
- **PC / SIGNS / HOUSE_OBJECTS:** Impassable. Includes Bookshelves, TVs, Radios, Windows, etc. Interact from adjacent tile.
- **FAKE_HOLE:** Tiles appearing as holes/warps in Burned Tower B1F (e.g. 10,8) are traversable floors. Verify with Game State Warps list.
- **WATER:** Traversable using Surf. Contains wild Pokémon and Swimmers.
- **WHIRLPOOL:** Impassable obstacle. Requires HM Whirlpool to cross (Hypothesis).
- **BUOY:** Impassable obstacle. Forms barriers on sea routes. Look for gaps.
- **ROCK:** Impassable obstacle. Treated as a solid object.

### Battle Mechanics
- **Menu Navigation:** ALWAYS use `select_battle_option` for the main battle menu. Never use raw directional inputs here.
- **Move Menu Layout:** The move selection menu is a vertical list. Use UP/DOWN to navigate. LEFT/RIGHT do not work.
- **Cursor Memory:** The move cursor remembers the last used move. ALWAYS check cursor position before selecting!
- **Switch Prompt:** Defaults to YES. Press B to decline safely.
- **Accuracy Debuffs:** Effective vs strong opponents (e.g. Smokescreen).

## Strategy Notes
- Team Strategy: Paprika (Typhlosion) is the carry and current lead. Basalt (Geodude) has Magnitude.
- Protocol: Mark NPCs immediately.
- **Position Verification:** When movement is interrupted (e.g. by new object), immediately check actual coordinates. Do not assume movement completed.
- **Screen Text:** Trust visual evidence (Screen Text) over system notes if they conflict. Text can persist or trigger unexpectedly.
- Record new Pokémon discoveries immediately, even during battle.
- Always verify object existence before interacting.
- **NPC Interaction:** Use `stun_npc` on moving NPCs to ensure successful interaction.
- **Smokescreen Survival:** Against stronger/type-advantaged opponents, stacking accuracy debuffs is a verified survival strategy.
- **Marking Protocol:** Mark objects *immediately* upon sighting to capture their ID.
- **Sprite Deception:** NPCs may use sprites that don't match their trainer class (e.g. Hiker Benjamin looked like a Pokefan). Always verify identity via interaction or battle.

## National Park (Cleared)
- Connected Route 35 & 36. Bug Catching Contest (Tue/Thu/Sat).

## Phone Log
- Hiker Anthony: Mentioned wild Geodude appearing often (Swarm?).

## PC Storage
- Briar (Nidoran♀) Lv12 [National Park]
## Fly Map Mechanics
- **Navigation:** The Fly map cursor navigation appears to be list-based (cycling through towns in a specific order: New Bark -> Cherrygrove -> Violet -> Azalea -> Goldenrod -> Ecruteak -> Olivine -> Cianwood -> Mahogany -> Lake of Rage -> Blackthorn -> Mt. Silver) rather than purely spatial. Use UP/DOWN to cycle efficiently.

## Route 37
- **Status:** Exploring. Heading North to Ecruteak.
- **Trainers:**
  - Psychic Greg (Drowzee Lv17) at (6, 6). Defeated.
- **Geography:** Short route connecting Route 36 and Ecruteak City.
- **Apricorns:** Suspected 'Weird Trees' (Red/Blue/Black Apricorns usually found here).
- **Observed Movesets:**
  - **Drowzee (Lv17):** Hypnosis.
- **Lesson:** Always verify specific tile mechanics (e.g. directional ledges) are explicitly coded in pathfinding tools to avoid invalid paths.
- **Tool Usage:** Always remember to set `autopress_buttons: true` when using custom tools that return button sequences.
## Burned Tower (Archived)
- Cleared. Rival defeated. Beasts released.
- **Key Lessons:**
  - **Action is Truth:** Never assume a tool is updated unless the `tool_code_updated` message appears.
  - **Wild Escapes:** Escape probability increases with failed attempts.
  - **Fake Hazards:** Some visual holes (e.g. Burned Tower B1F 10,9) are safe. Verify with Game State.

## Route 38

- **Trainers:** Sailor Harry, Lass Dana, Beauty Olivia (Defeated).
