## IV. Area & Navigation Insights

### Tile Traversal Rules
- **Objects are impassable:** All map objects (items, trees, signs, defeated trainers etc.) act as as walls.
- **WALL:** Impassable.
- **FLOOR:** Traversable.
- **TALL_GRASS:** Traversable, triggers wild encounters.
- **LEDGE:** Confirmed one-way downward traversal.
- **COUNTER:** Impassable.
- **DOOR/CAVE:** Warp tile, triggered by movement.
- **MART_SHELF/BOOKSHELF/TV/RADIO/PC/TOWN_MAP/WINDOW/PAINTING/STATUE/PILLAR:** Impassable scenery.

## V. Untested Hypotheses & To-Do
- **Hypothesis:** My current team, heavily reliant on a single high-level Pokémon, may struggle against future Gym Leaders.
- **Confirmed:** Not all Cooltrainers will battle me. Some offer advice.
- **To-Do:** Check for alternative healing methods besides the Pokémon Center.
- **To-Do:** Systematically test all unverified tile mechanics. Find examples of each 'Untested' tile and attempt to move on them from all four directions.
- **To-Do:** Explore the water on Route 32 with the OLD ROD.
- **To-Do:** Prioritize testing `WARP_CARPET_LEFT` and `WARP_CARPET_RIGHT` tiles.
- **To-Do:** Test assumption that the path west from (12, 22) on Route 32 leads south.

## VI. Strategic Notes
- **Onix's Moveset:** My Onix (ROCKY) lacks a Rock-type move, which is a major disadvantage. **Plan:** Level up ROCKY and hope he learns a Rock-type move soon, or find a TM. For now, rely on G (Croconaw) and use ROCKY for defensive switching or to use SCREECH.
- **Party Full:** My party is now full with the addition of the Egg. I can't catch any new Pokémon until I deposit one in the PC.
