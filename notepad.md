# Exploration Status: S.S. Aqua
- **Quest:** Find Gentleman's Granddaughter.
- **Progress:**
  - Checked 1F East/Mid: Empty/Dead Ends.
  - Checked 1F West: Pending.
  - **Current Location:** Lower Deck Far East (via 1F 27,15).
  - **Findings:** Found Gentleman (Grandfather). He says the girl is "bugging someone."
- **Action:** Exiting to 1F. Heading West to find the Captain's Quarters (likely the Northern Room of 15_5).
- **Log:** Exiting Lower Deck Far East. Heading to 1F West side.
- **Log:** Accidentally entered B1F (Map 15_7) via ladder at 1F (30, 14).
- **Observation:** I am in a section of B1F separated by a wall at Column 29.
- **Plan:** Explore this section to find a way West (to the main B1F area) or return to 1F if stuck.
- **Action:** Battling Sailor in B1F East section before returning to 1F.
- **Quest Info:** Sailor at B1F (30, 6) wants me to find his "lazy buddy" who is goofing off.
- **Hypothesis:** The "buddy" might be the Sailor I saw earlier on 1F at (22, 17).
- **Plan:** Quick check of the north end of this corridor, then return to 1F to find the buddy and explore the West side.
- **Observation:** Wall at Column 29 has an opening at Rows 4 and 5. This is the path West.
- **Action:** Stunned Sailor (ID 1) at (30, 6) to bypass him via (31, 6).
- **Log:** Successfully navigating around stunned Sailor (ID 1) via (31, 7) -> (31, 6) -> (29, 5).
- **Observation:** A second Sailor (ID 2) appeared at (31, 6), blocking the path alongside Sailor 1 at (30, 6).
- **Action:** Interacting with Sailor 2 to clear the path.
- **Log:** Retrying interaction with Sailor 2 at (31, 6) (Facing Up).
- **Hypothesis:** If Sailor 2 doesn't move/battle, I must return to 1F to find the "lazy buddy" to clear the path.
- **Observation:** Sailor 2 at (31, 6) appears to be non-interactable (no text). The path West is fully blocked by two sailors.
- **Action:** Returning to 1F to find the "lazy buddy" (suspected Sailor at 1F 22,17).
- **Action:** Navigating to 1F (22, 17) to find the "lazy buddy" Sailor (ID 3).
- **Goal:** Talk to him to clear the blockade in B1F.
