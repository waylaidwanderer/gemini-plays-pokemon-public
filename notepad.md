# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Challenge the Pokémon League.
- **Secondary:** Defeat Champion Lance.
- **Tertiary:** Become Champion.

# Current Status
- **Location:** Lance's Room.
- **Party:**
  - Muscle (Lv65): Fainted.
  - Garnet (Lv29): Active (81/81 HP).
  - Kunai (Lv24): Healthy.
  - Gyarados: Low HP.
- **Inventory:** 8 Revives.

# Battle Status
- **Opponent:** Lance (Champion).
- **Active Matchup:** Muscle vs Aerodactyl.
- **Strategy:** Attrition (Rock Smash -> Struggle).
- **Remaining Enemies:** Aerodactyl, Charizard, Dragonite x2.

# Plan
1.  **Vs Aerodactyl:** Spam Rock Smash (8 PP left).
2.  **Vs Others:** Struggle (if PP empty) or Rock Smash.
3.  **Emergency:** If Muscle faints, switch to fodder -> Revive -> Resume.
- **Turn 19417 Result:** Aerodactyl outsped (Wing Attack, 60 dmg). Muscle used Rock Smash (Crit + Def Drop!).
- **Status:** Muscle 155/215 HP. Aerodactyl took significant damage.
- **Action:** Use Rock Smash (Slot 3).
- **Reasoning:** Aerodactyl is faster but Muscle can tank 2 more hits easily. -1 Defense makes Rock Smash more viable.
- **PP:** Rock Smash 8/15.
- **Turn 19418:** Muscle (155/215 HP) vs Aerodactyl.
- **Action:** Use Rock Smash (Slot 3).
- **Reasoning:** Rock Smash (Fighting) is Neutral vs Aerodactyl. Need to empty PP to reach Struggle (50 BP, Normal) which is better vs Charizard/Dragonite (Neutral) than Rock Smash (Resisted).
- **Status:** Rock Smash 7 PP left.
- **Strategy Update:** Embracing the "Struggle Sweep". Muscle will become a berserker.
- **Turn 19419:** Aerodactyl used Wing Attack (Super Effective, ~60 dmg). Muscle used Rock Smash (Crit! Def fell!).
- **Status:** Muscle 96/215 HP. Aerodactyl HP low (Yellow/Red?).
- **Action:** Use Rock Smash (Slot 3).
- **Reasoning:** Muscle survives one more hit. Rock Smash to finish or weaken further.
- **PP:** Rock Smash 7/15.
- **Turn 19425:** Garnet active.
- **Action:** Select PACK -> Use Revive on Muscle.
- **Reasoning:** Cannot waste a turn attacking with Garnet (fodder). Must revive Muscle while Garnet takes the hit.
- **Outcome:** Muscle will be at 50% HP. Garnet likely faints.
- **Next:** Switch Muscle in. Resume Rock Smash.
- **Turn 19426:** Mistakenly entered FIGHT menu.
- **Correction:** B (Back) -> Down (PACK) -> A (Select).
- **Goal:** Open Pack to use Revive on Muscle.
- **Priority:** Items act before attacks. Revive Muscle NOW. Garnet will take the hit afterwards.
- **Turn 19427:** Input truncated last turn (only 'B' processed).
- **Current State:** Main Battle Menu. Cursor on FIGHT.
- **Action:** Select PACK.
- **Goal:** Use Revive on Muscle (Priority move).
- **Outcome:** Muscle revives. Garnet takes the hit (fodder).
- **Turn 19430:** Switching to Garnet (A).
- **Situation:** Muscle Fainted. Need a live Pokemon to use Revive.
- **Gamble:** Hope Aerodactyl uses a status move or misses on the switch-in.
- **If Garnet faints:** Switch to Kunai.
- **If Garnet survives:** Use Revive on Muscle immediately.
