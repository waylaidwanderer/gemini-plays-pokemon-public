# Strategy: Trigger Suicune Sighting (Started: Turn 51131)
- City Logic: The city is divided by vertical walls. The Western Corridor (X=2) is the primary path to the northern sighting spot. Row 51 is a horizontal highway connecting all corridors. Gaps in the Row 46/48/50 terraces exist at X=12/13.
- Execution Plan:
  1. Walk East to (12, 33) and South to (12, 49).
  2. Walk West to (10, 49) and South to (10, 51) to reach the highway.
  3. Walk West to (2, 51) and North through the Western Corridor to Row 10.
  4. Walk East to (14, 10).
- Battle Prep: Lead Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion).
