# PC Storage (Box 1)
- Ravioli (KRABBY): Lv10 (Surf, Whirlpool)
- LAPIS (POLIWAG): Lv12 (Waterfall, Surf, Whirlpool)

# Verified Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable from SOUTH (cannot walk north). Represents a ledge face.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump from NORTH to SOUTH.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- FLOOR: Walkable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Traversable only via Surf.
- (11, 14): Dead End Pocket. Wall at (11, 13) and (12, 14) blocks access to the north plateau.
- (11, 15): Gap in the city wall (Y=15). Accesses the beach area but not the plateau.

# Suicune Quest Strategy: 'The Buoy Spiral'
- Fact: The northern plateau is isolated by ledges. The only access is by water from the east, navigating the buoy spiral.
- Confirmed Spiral Route:
    1. Start Surfing from (19, 30).
    2. Sail to (26, 28), then North through Gap 1 at (26, 10).
    3. Sail Left to (22, 10), then South through Gap 2 at (22, 16).
    4. Sail Left to (19, 16), then North through Gap 3 at (19, 14).
    5. Sail North to (19, 11), then West past Wall 7 (ends at Y=12).
    6. Land at (16, 11) or (14, 10).
    7. Walk West/North to sighting area at (7, 4).
- Preparation: Lead with XENON (Haunter). Use SUPER REPEL once on water.
- Start Turn: 47680 (Suicune North Beach Quest)
- Start Time: Wednesday, Jan 14, 2026, 4:00 AM PST

# Strategy Lessons
- Buoy Maze: The buoy spiral is the only intended path. Land routes from the south are blocked by ledge faces (FLOOR_UP_WALL).
- Menu Memory: Items in the pack stay selected. Verify cursor before mashing A.
- Efficiency: Use (19, 30) for launching into the spiral.
