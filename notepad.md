# Gem's Brain 🧠

## 1. My Toolkit
### Built-in Tools
- `notepad_edit`
- `run_code`
- `define_agent`
- `delete_agent`
- `define_map_marker`
- `delete_map_marker`
- `stun_npc`
- `define_tool`
- `delete_tool`
- `select_battle_option`

### Custom Agents

- `reality_check_agent`: Checks my plans against game state to prevent hallucinations.
- `puzzle_solver_agent`: Suggests simple, logical tests for puzzles.
- `navigation_strategist`: A unified navigation advisor.
- `party_strategist_agent`: Analyzes the player's stored Pokémon and a given strategic goal to recommend an optimal party of three.
- `battle_puzzle_agent`: An agent to devise multi-turn strategies for complex battles with non-standard win conditions (e.g., stall tactics against Wobbuffet), considering opponent move patterns and status effects.

### Custom Tools
- `deterministic_battle_strategist`: Recommends battle actions and moves.
- `plan_path_to_target`: Generates a path to a target coordinate. NOTE: This tool only PLANS the path. You must set `buttons_to_press` to `['path']` to execute it.
- `select_move_tool`: A tool that takes a move slot number (1-4) as input and outputs the correct sequence of button presses to select and use that move in battle.

## 2. 🚨 CRITICAL DIRECTIVES & LESSONS
- **THE LLM REALITY:** As an LLM, my "thinking" only happens when I process a prompt. There is no "later." Any task I identify (fixing a tool, updating notes, placing a marker) MUST be performed in the CURRENT turn. Deferring tasks is a critical failure based on a misunderstanding of my own nature.
- **BATTLE TOWER SAVE CORRUPTION (CRITICAL):** Saving the game to start the battle challenge is a **guaranteed trigger** for a game-breaking glitch that corrupts all player data. My previous hypothesis that a valid party would prevent this was **incorrect**. The glitch is unavoidable. The only way to reverse the corruption is to press 'B' at the level select menu and then select 'YES' to cancel the challenge.
- **BATTLE TOWER ESCAPE (CONFIRMATION BIAS):** The save corruption glitch is a **reset mechanism**, not an escape route. The only confirmed way to leave the Battle Tower is to **win a battle** or use the cancel-out method.
- **IMMEDIATE MAINTENANCE:** All data management (notepad, markers) and tool/agent fixes MUST be done in the same turn a new discovery or bug is found. There is no 'later'.
- **AGENT VERIFICATION:** Agent outputs are hypotheses, not facts. The `world_navigator_agent` incorrectly assumed I had the SECRET POTION just because I had the Storm Badge. I MUST verify all claims, especially those related to inventory, before changing my goals.
- **PATH EXECUTION:** Calling `plan_path_to_target` only generates a path. I MUST set `buttons_to_press` to `["path"]` to actually move, otherwise I will hallucinate my position.
- **REALITY CHECKS:** My internal sense of location is unreliable. I MUST verify my position from the game state before any significant action to prevent hallucination loops.
- **COORDINATE SYSTEM:** Map data is 0-indexed (`0 <= coordinate < dimension`). Pathfinding tools MUST use this logic.
- **INVENTORY VERIFICATION:** I must check my PACK before assuming I have an item to prevent hallucination (e.g., the nonexistent ESCAPE ROPE incident).
- **TEXT BOXES:** Pressing 'B' is not a universal solution for closing text boxes where 'A' fails (e.g., Sailor in Olivine Lighthouse), but it has been confirmed to work for breaking dialogue loops (e.g., Rival on Route 41). This should be tested as an alternative when 'A' is unresponsive.
- **TOOL MISUSE:** `autopress_buttons=true` is ONLY for tools that output button strings, not coordinates or decisions.
- **ITEM MANAGEMENT:** Taking a held item with a full bag destroys it. The only safe way to free a slot is to have a Pokémon hold an item.
- **DIG GLITCH (CRITICAL):** Using DIG as a field move in the Olivine Lighthouse dead-end room causes a game-breaking glitch, corrupting all player data. Avoid using DIG as a field move until further testing.

## 3. Main Quest & Active Leads
- **Primary Objective:** Deliver the SECRETPOTION to Jasmine at the Olivine Lighthouse.
- **Legendary Beasts:** Suicune, Raikou, and Entei have been awakened in the Burned Tower. The Sage in the Tin Tower has asked me not to enter.
- **Stolen Pokémon (Cianwood):** A Rocker's Pokémon was stolen. I am currently safekeeping his SHUCKIE.
- **Moomoo Farm:** The Miltank is sick and requires a specific item named 'BERRY'. Other named berries do not work.

### Phone Contacts
- **DANA (LASS):** Route 38 (Rematch).
- **GINA (PICNICKER):** Route 34 (Rematch).
- **HUEY (SAILOR):** OLIVINE LIGHTHOUSE (Rematch).
- **ANTHONY (HIKER):** Route 33 (Rematch). Chatted about MACHOP & GEODUDE.
- **JACK (SCHOOLBOY):** NATIONAL PARK (Rematch). Chatted about VOLTORB.
- **ALAN (SCHOOLBOY):** Route 36 (Rematch). Chatted about beating a Ledyba.

## Special Events & Swarms
- **Hiker Anthony:** Dunsparce swarm in Dark Cave.

## 4. World State & Blocked Paths
- **Tin Tower:** Path blocked by a Sage (legendary beasts awakened).
- **Olivine Lighthouse:** Path up is blocked, needs 'special medicine'.
- **Route 41 (WHIRL ISLANDS):** Interior is 'pitch-black' (needs FLASH); WHIRLPOOL tiles are impassable.
- **Route 42:** Path to Mahogany Town blocked by water (needs SURF).
- **Goldenrod Underground:** Locked door at (18, 6) is unsolved.
- **Route 40/41 Water Route:** Confirmed dead end. Multiple pathfinding attempts to the west failed, blocked by a buoy maze.
- **Battle Tower:** The receptionist at (7, 6) on BattleTower1F stated that only three Pokémon may be entered. This is a confirmed prerequisite.

## 5. Untested Assumptions
- **FLY HM:** I'm assuming FLY isn't working due to a story event or a bug. **Alternative Hypothesis:** Maybe it only works from certain locations (like cities) or I'm missing a prerequisite I'm unaware of.
- **Azalea Gym:** The statues at the entrance might be switches. Alt: They do nothing, and the puzzle is floor-based or involves trainer interaction order.
- **Battle Tower Escape:** My current assumption is that winning a battle is the only way out. **Alternative Hypotheses:** 1) I need to use a specific Key Item in the lobby. 2) I need to talk to an NPC after a specific trigger (like accessing the PC). 3) The solution involves a specific party composition when talking to the receptionist.

## 6. Confirmed System Mechanics
- **Respawning Obstacles:** HM-cleared obstacles (like CUT_TREE) respawn upon re-entering a map.
- **HM Move Permanence:** HM moves cannot be forgotten through normal means.
- **Multi-Press Dialogue:** Some NPCs require pressing 'A' multiple times to advance text.
- **Phone List Limit:** The phone list can become full.
- **`stun_npc` Tool:** Freezes an NPC's movement but does not make them traversable. CRITICAL: This tool only works on NPCs that are currently visible on the screen ('live objects').
- **Evolution via Trade:** MACHOKE, KADABRA, HAUNTER, and GRAVELER evolve by trading.
- **Defeated Trainers as Obstacles:** Trainers in the Azalea Gym remain impassable after defeat.
- **STRENGTH HM:** The move STRENGTH is used to *push* boulders, not break them. The boulder requires an empty space on the opposite side to be moved.

### 7. Tile Mechanics
### Impassable
- BOOKSHELF, BUOY, COUNTER, CUT_TREE (needs CUT), HEADBUTT_TREE (needs HEADBUTT), MART_SHELF, PC (interactable), PILLAR, RADIO, ROCK (needs STRENGTH), TV, VOID, WALL, WHIRLPOOL, WINDOW
- **TOWN_MAP:** Impassable. Interactable from the tile below it (3,1), which displays a full-screen map of the Whirl Islands. This view is cancelled by any subsequent directional input.
### Traversable
- FLOOR (standard traversable ground), GRASS, TALL_GRASS (wild encounters)
### Warp Tiles
- DOOR, LADDER, STAIRCASE (two-way)
- PIT (one-way)
- WARP_CARPET_RIGHT (one-way)
### Conditional & One-Way
- FLOOR_UP_WALL (ledge, down only)
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN (down only)
- LEDGE_HOP_LEFT (left only)
- LEDGE_HOP_RIGHT (right only)
- WATER (impassable without SURF)
- WARP_CARPET_DOWN (Confirmed one-way exit. Inactive when stepped on from the lobby side, confirming they are destinations from the battle rooms. Need to test upward traversal if encountered from the other side.)

### 8. Key Discoveries (Archive)
- **Sudowoodo Tree (Route 36):** Solved with SQUIRTBOTTLE.
- **Olivine Lighthouse Descent:** Solved by finding a new pit on 6F.
- **CianwoodLugiaSpeechHouse Escape:** Solved by pressing 'B'.
- **LIGHTHOUSE SAILOR CRASH (CRITICAL):** Interacting with the Sailor at Olivine Lighthouse 3F (9, 2) while on the warp at (9, 3) causes a game-breaking crash.

### 9. Current Puzzle: Battle Tower Escape
- **Objective:** Exit the Battle Tower lobby.
- **State:** Receptionist at (7, 6) blocks the exit door at (7, 0).
- **SOLVED:** The Battle Tower puzzle is solved. The receptionist blocking the exit only moves after using the save-glitch cancel sequence. Losing a battle only resets the player to the lobby.

## 9. Reflection Log & New Ideas
- **Data Management Lapses (Turn 45736):** I have deferred notepad/marker updates instead of performing them immediately. This is a critical failure I must correct.
- **Tool Maintenance Failure (Turn 45905):** I identified a critical flaw in the `deterministic_battle_strategist` but deferred the fix, violating my core directive of immediate maintenance. This is a major process error that cannot be repeated.
- **Agent Underutilization (Turns 45865-45881, 46237):** I failed to use the `puzzle_solver_agent` for the Battle Tower lobby escape, instead wasting numerous turns on manual, inefficient hypothesis testing.

## 10. Lessons Learned
- **Verify Before Automating:** I wasted time creating PC tools based on the unverified assumption that the Battle Tower PC was a standard Pokémon Storage System. I must verify the functionality of an object *before* developing tools to automate interaction with it.

## Tool Failures & Fixes
- **deterministic_battle_strategist (Turn 45905):** Recommended a suicidal 'Peck' against a Wobbuffet with active Destiny Bond and Counter. The tool's Wobbuffet logic failed because it lacked data for non-damaging moves like GROWL and LEER. This is a critical failure of foresight and data management. Fixed in Turn 45931.
- **MAJOR HALLUCINATION (Turns 46480-46500):** I completely ignored my own verified and documented solution for the Battle Tower escape puzzle in my notepad. Instead, I pursued the disproven hypothesis that winning a battle was necessary, wasting over 20 turns building a team for a non-existent problem. This is a critical failure to trust my own data.
