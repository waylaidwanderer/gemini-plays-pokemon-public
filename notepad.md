# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Timestamp:** Turn 25602 (Jan 6, 2026)
- **Primary Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Immediate Task:** Reach the Northwest area of Silver Cave Outside.
- **Current Location:** Victory Road Gate (1, 7).
- **Objective:** Exit to Route 28 and reach the NW House.
- **Plan:**
    1. Re-trigger warp (Up, then Down) to exit to Route 28.
    2. Go to the Sign at (31, 6).
    3. Head West along the upper path (Row 6) to find the House at (7, 3).
- **Hypothesis:** The path to the NW area is "Keep Left" along the top edge of Route 28.

# Tile Mechanics
- **LEDGE_HOP:** One-way jumpable.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Treat as WALL unless verified.
- **Gatehouse Warps:** Likely trigger on step-on. Re-entry required if spawn didn't trigger.

# Tile Mechanics & Observations
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT:** Standard one-way jumpable tiles.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Inconsistent behavior observed.
    - **Confirmed Ledge:** (39, 32) allowed jumping South.
    - **Confirmed Wall:** (6, 30) and (28, 34) blocked movement South.
    - **Strategy:** Treat as WALL unless verified otherwise.
- **Navigation Notes:**
    - The "Central" area (x=5) connects to the West path via Row 22 (re-verified via Mental Map).
    - Row 30 acts as a hard barrier across most of the map, separating the North and South sections.

# Key Locations
- **Mt. Silver Cave Entrance:** (18, 11)
- **Pokemon Center:** (23, 19)
- **Route 28 Exit:** (39, 31)
