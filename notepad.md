# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
## Strategy: Western Loop Efficiency
Reach the northern plateau (14, 10) by bypassing land blockades via high-level wall gaps. The target is the Western Corridor (X=0-2), the only land path past the Row 15 ledge.

## Execution Plan
1. Move to (12, 44) via Row 44 thoroughfare.
2. Move West to (6, 44) (bypasses Gym and PokeCenter).
3. Move North to (6, 35).
4. Move West to (2, 35) via gap at (5, 35).
5. Move North along X=2 to Row 12.
6. Walk East to (14, 12) and North to (14, 10).
