# Suicune Quest Strategy (Crystal)
- Status: ROAMING (Post-Tin Tower battle).
- Current Location (Pokedex): Route 37 (Turn 19218).
- Strategy: Boundary cycling between Ecruteak City and Route 37.
- Lead: XENON (Gastly Lv21) with Mean Look and Hypnosis.

# Suicune Battle Strategy (Lv40)
- Goal: Prevent flee and capture.
- Turn 1: Use MEAN LOOK (XENON). 
- Speed Check: Suicune (Base 85, Lv40) is likely faster than Gastly (Base 80, Lv21).
- Efficiency: Use SUPER REPEL with XENON (Lv21) leading to filter out low-level encounters (Lv13-16) and target Suicune (Lv40).
- Turn 2+: Use HYPNOSIS.
- Turn 3+: Chip damage with NIGHT SHADE (fixed damage = level).
- Note: If Suicune uses Roar, Mean Look is broken.

# Capture Prep & Funding
- Strategy: Mean Look -> Hypnosis -> Chip away HP (if safe) -> Throw Balls.
- Resources: 1 Ultra Ball, 23 Great Balls.
- Funds: ¥2373.
- Note: Max Revive and Full Restore are in inventory.

# Ultra Ball Hypotheses
- Hypothesis 1: Goldenrod Dept. Store sells Ultra Balls.
- Hypothesis 2: Blackthorn City Mart sells Ultra Balls.
- Hypothesis 3: Indigo Plateau Mart sells Ultra Balls.

# Boundary Cycling Plan (Ecruteak <-> Route 37)
1. Move to (17, 35) in Ecruteak City.
2. Step south to Route 37.
3. Check Pokedex.
4. If Suicune is on Route 37, search grass.
5. If not, step north to Ecruteak City and repeat.

# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- TALL_GRASS: Traversable, triggers wild encounters. Verified on Route 37.

# Reflection Notes (Turn 19235)
- Ecruteak Mart lacks Ultra Balls.
- Suicune confirmed on Route 37.
- Strategy: Use Super Repel with Lv21 lead to force Suicune encounter.
- No Quick Claw in inventory; speed might be an issue. Use suicune_tracker_v2 for advice.
