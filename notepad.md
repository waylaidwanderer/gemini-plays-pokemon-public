# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Navigation Notes
- **Location**: Goldenrod City (Central).
- **Goal**: Find the path North to Route 35.
- **Current Action**: Moving South to Row 28, then West to x=2 (Main Road).
- **Reasoning**: The center path (x=9) is blocked by a tree at (9, 22). I need to verify if the Main Road at x=2 is open past Row 21.
- **Hypothesis**: The Mental Map showing Row 21 as fully blocked might be incorrect or contain a pass-through gate I haven't seen up close.

### Resource Alert
- **Pokeballs**: 10 Poké Balls, 1 Lure Ball.
