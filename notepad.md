# Strategy for Suicune Encounter (Crystal)
- **Status:** Mandatory sightings on Route 42 and Route 36 are required to trigger the Suicune battle at Tin Tower 1F.
- **Sequence:**
  1. Burned Tower: Legendary beasts flee. [Verified]
  2. Cianwood City (North): Suicune sighting. [Verified]
  3. Route 42 (Central Island): Suicune sighting near Apricorn trees. [Attempted - Sprite missing]
  4. Route 36 (Sudowoodo junction): Suicune sighting. [Pending]
  5. Tin Tower 1F: Final encounter with Suicune.
- **Immediate Plan:** Exit menu, face right (14, 9), and Surf to the central island of Route 42. Check for Suicune near the Apricorn trees (27-29, 16). If sighted and it flees, proceed to Route 36. If not present, re-verify Cianwood sighting or talk to Eusine in Ecruteak. Finally, trigger Suicune at Tin Tower 1F by talking to all three Sages.

# General Lessons
- Suicune Trigger: Suicune is an overworld sprite. If the sprite is not visible on Route 42, the sighting hasn't been triggered or the conditions aren't met.
- Order: Burned Tower -> Cianwood -> Route 42 -> Route 36 -> Tin Tower.
- Tool Usage: Use custom tools for repetitive navigation/menu tasks.
- Johto Fly Map: "Up" scrolls cities (New Bark -> Violet -> Ecruteak).
- **Tin Tower Trigger (Analyst Advice):** If overworld sightings fail, talk to all three Sages on Tin Tower 1F while holding the Clear Bell and Fog Badge. Suicune should jump down. [To be tested after Route 42/36 sightings]
