# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) in Cianwood City to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The West Beach Ledge Jump
- Plan:
  1. Walk to (6, 33) via Row 33. [IN PROGRESS]
  2. Jump DOWN ledge at (6, 34) to (6, 35).
  3. Walk West to West Beach (X=2) via Row 35.
  4. Walk North along West Beach (X=2) to Row 12.
  5. Walk East along Row 12 to (14, 12), then North to (14, 10).
- Status: At (19, 42). Repel active. Stunned NPC 1.
- Reasoning: Row 15 is a solid barrier. X=2 (West Beach) is the only vertical highway North. Row 33 has a gap at X=9 to reach the central city. The ledge at (6, 34) provides the only confirmed land access to the western beach corridor (Row 35).

# Blocked Routes (Verified)
- Row 15: Solid line of WALL and LEDGE_HOP_DOWN from X=3 to X=17.
- City Walls: Vertical walls at X=5, X=11, X=17, X=20, X=22.
- Row 30 Cliff: Impassable FLOOR_UP_WALL from X=4 to X=11.

# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard ground. Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Surf required.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable cliff face.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
