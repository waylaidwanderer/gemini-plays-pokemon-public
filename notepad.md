# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Current Status
- **Location**: Cianwood City (22_9), Inside Pharmacy.
- **Goal**: Get SecretPotion.
- **Status**: Battling Swimmer Kara (Pokemon 2: Starmie).
- **Reasoning**:
  1. **Visual Confirmation**: Move Menu Open. Cursor is on **FLAME WHEEL**.
  2. **Action**: Pressing 'A' to attack.
  3. **Math**: Garnet (38 HP) can survive ~2-3 Water Guns. Flame Wheel is NVE but Lv 40 vs Lv 20 should deal decent damage.
  4. **Contingency**: If Garnet faints, I have 3 Revives.
- **Plan**:
  1. Attack with Flame Wheel.
  2. Defeat Starmie.
  3. Heal Garnet.
  4. Surf North.

### Objectives
- **Primary**: Obtain Mineral Badge (Jasmine).
- **Secondary**: Get SecretPotion (Cianwood).
- **Tertiary**: Train Basil to Lvl 21.

### Notes
- **Cianwood Pharmacy**: Supposed to have the SecretPotion.
- **Gym**: Chuck (Fighting). Weak to Psychic/Flying. Needs Strength (HM04) to reach.
- **Plan**:
  1. Get SecretPotion (Current).
  2. Buy Repels at General Store (22_3).
  3. Surf to Olivine City.
  4. Get HM04 (Strength) from Café.
  5. Climb Lighthouse, Heal Amphy.
  6. Defeat Jasmine (Steel) with Garnet.
  7. Return to Cianwood (Surf), Defeat Chuck, get Fly.
- **Shuckle Guy**: Found at (17, 41) in Cianwood (Map 22_4). Offers a Shuckle to look after.
- **Search Update**: Building at (17, 41) is NOT the Pharmacy. Pharmacy is likely South of the Pokemon Center.
- **Discovery**: Found a previously unnoticed door at (15, 37) in Cianwood.
- **Hypothesis**: This is likely the Pharmacy.
- **Plan**: Navigate to (15, 38) and enter.
