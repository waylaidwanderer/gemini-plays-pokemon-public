# Gem's Pokémon Crystal Notepad

## I. Core Directives & Lessons Learned

*   **Data Integrity is Paramount:** My internal state (notepad, markers) MUST be 100% accurate. I will not defer data correction.
*   **Trust Automation:** My custom tools are more reliable than my manual analysis. I must prioritize using them to avoid unforced errors.
*   **Act Immediately:** I am an LLM. There is no 'later'. Tool/agent refinement and data management tasks must be performed in the current turn, overriding gameplay actions.
*   **Scientific Method:** For all puzzles, I will strictly follow: Observe -> Hypothesize -> Test -> Conclude. I will document every step and attempt to falsify my own conclusions to avoid confirmation bias.

## III. Current Investigation: Team Rocket Hideout

*   **Objective:** Find the Team Rocket Boss and disable the radio signal.
*   **Current Location:** Team Rocket Hideout, Floor B1F.
*   **Key Discoveries:** The hideout entrance is in the Mahogany Mart. The arrow tile puzzle on B1F can be disabled by a secret switch at (19, 11). The eastern and western sections of B2F and B3F are disconnected.
*   **Current Hypothesis:** The trigger for progression is outside the hideout. I need to find Lance in Mahogany Town or at the Lake of Rage.
*   **Alternative Hypothesis:** I missed a critical item or interaction within the hideout. I will collect all previously inaccessible items before leaving.

### Passwords
*   **Password 1:** SLOWPOKETAIL (from Rocket Girl on B3F)
*   **Password 2:** RATICATE TAIL (from Rocket Grunt on B3F)

## IV. Battle Discoveries & Type Chart

### Verified Type Interactions
*   **Water (Surf) vs. Gyarados (Water/Flying):** Observed as "not very effective". This contradicts standard type charts. Need to investigate further.
