# Game Mechanics & Lessons

## Agent Development & Tactics
- The `master_pathfinder_agent` is unreliable and should not be used. Manual navigation is the current standard.
- Battle tactics need to be more proactive. I will not wait until a Pok√©mon's HP is critical before using priority moves like Quick Attack.

## Battle Notes
- If running from a wild battle fails more than twice, it is more efficient to defeat the opponent (e.g., failed to run from Geodude 3 times in Mt. Moon).
