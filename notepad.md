# Suicune Quest Strategy (Crystal)
- Current Step: Encounter Roaming Suicune (Hypothesis).
- Evidence: Summary Turn 18350-19055 states Suicune was "engaged in battle" at Tin Tower and then "tracked across routes". This describes roaming behavior.
- Status: Pokedex dot is currently on Route 42. It is not on the island.
- Verification Plan:
    1. Enter Mt. Mortar (28, 9) to change maps.
    2. Exit and check Pokedex.
    3. If dot moved, Suicune is roaming.
- Capture Strategy:
    1. Lead XENON (Gastly Lv21) for Mean Look + Hypnosis.
    2. Problem: XENON is underleveled (Suicune is Lv40). Need to train or use GNEISS to tank.
    3. Resources: Need more Ultra Balls (Current: 1).
- Funding: Sell Fire/Water stones at Ecruteak Mart. Clear Route 42/44 trainers.

# Battle Prep & Funding
- Target: Suicune (Lv40).
- Strategy: Lead XENON (Gastly Lv21) for Hypnosis. Weaken with GNEISS (Lv44).
- Resources: 1 Ultra Ball, 23 Great Balls. Need ~¥12,000 for 10+ Ultra Balls.
- Plan: 
    1. Sell Fire/Water Stones at Ecruteak Mart (¥2100).
    2. Defeat remaining trainers on Route 42/44.

# Tile Mechanics
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN/RIGHT: One-way movement.
- HEADBUTT_TREE/CUT_TREE: Impassable; Cut removes Cut Trees.
- COUNTER: Interact from adjacent tile.

# Lessons Learned
- Pokedex scrolling is sensitive; verify selection (#245) before clicking 'AREA'.
- Suicune is NOT roaming at this stage; it's a fixed overworld event.
