## Lessons Learned / Hypotheses / Game Mechanics:
*   **Menu Navigation (Naming Screen):**
    *   Be extremely precise with directional inputs for cursor movement.
    *   Verify the selected letter *before* pressing 'A'.
    *   The keyboard sometimes seems to reset to uppercase or shift cursor unexpectedly. Pay close attention.
    *   Backspace is 'B'. Start confirms name.
*   **Poison:** Outside battle, poisoned Pokémon lose 1 HP every 4 steps. (From prompt)
*   **Pikachu Movement:** Can walk through Pikachu. If adjacent and not facing, 1st press turns, 2nd moves.
*   **Ledge Traversal:** One 'Down' press from above moves to Y+2.
*   **Warp Types:**
    *   1x1 (doors, ladders) are instant. Move off and on to re-warp.
    *   Larger warps (2x1, 1x2 like exit mats) need 2 steps: onto warp, then into boundary/direction.
