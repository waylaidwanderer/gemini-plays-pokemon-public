# Kanto Campaign Status
- **Location:** Cerulean Pokemon Center.
- **Current Objective:** Reach the Power Plant via Route 9.
- **Location:** Cerulean Gym (Center Platform).
- **Immediate Task:** Explore the walkable area (Row 4-5) to verify if Misty or the Rocket Grunt is present.
- **Hypothesis:** The Gym is likely empty because I haven't triggered the Power Plant quest yet.
- **Strategy:**
    1. Verify Gym is empty.
    2. Exit and travel North to Route 24/25.
    3. Find the path East to Route 9 and the Power Plant.
    4. Trigger the quest at the Power Plant.
    5. Return to Cerulean Gym to find the Rocket Grunt.
- **Lesson:** If the game explicitly says "There's nothing to CUT here", accept it immediately. Do not test facing or menu options repeatedly.
- **Tile Mechanics:**
    - **LADDER:** Used for the bridge in Cerulean Gym. Functionally acts as a walkable FLOOR tile.

# Strategic Goals
