# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Challenge the Pokémon League.
- **Secondary:** Traverse Victory Road.
- **Tertiary:** Train team for Victory Road.
- **Immediate:** Navigate Route 26 North.

# Current Status (Turn 18955)
- **Location:** Victory Road 2F East (17, 37).
- **Party:** Gyarados (76/111), Muscle (Lv61).
- **Goal:** Reach Ladder at (17, 33).

# Exploration Log
- **1F:** West and East corridors largely explored. East side of 1F (north end) was a dead end.
- **2F West:** Loop with HP Up.
- **2F East:** Large room. Ladder at (17, 33) spotted but blocked by ledges from South.
- **Key Discovery:** Vertical corridor at x=12 appears open from y=36 Northwards.
- **Hypothesis:** The path to the ladder at (17, 33) involves navigating North along x=12, then looping East across the top (unseen area around y=30) to drop down to the ladder.

# Plan
1.  **Navigate:** From current position (17, 37), go West to (12, 37) area.
2.  **Gap:** Enter x=12 corridor at (12, 36).
3.  **Explore:** Head North along x=12 to (12, 31) and see if it connects East.
- **Reflection (Turn 19007):**
  - **Execution:** No deferred tasks.
  - **Notepad:** Consolidated and current.
  - **Map:** Markers are up to date (new path at x=12 marked).
  - **Tools:** Manual battle tools are sufficient.
  - **Goal:** Defeat Rival Silver -> Exit Victory Road.
  - **Errors:** Battle menu navigation requires careful tracking of cursor memory.

- **Status:** Battle with Rival Silver. Muscle vs Feraligatr.
- **Condition:** Muscle (124/201 HP, Speed fell). Feraligatr (Critical HP).
- **Menu State:** Move Menu Open. Cursor on DIG (Slot 2).
- **Action:** Select STRENGTH (Slot 1) to finish Feraligatr.
- **Sequence:** Up (to Strength) -> A (Select).
- **Remaining:** Magneton.
