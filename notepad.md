# Suicune Quest Strategy (Crystal Version)
- **Status:** All overworld sightings confirmed. Gatehouse Sage (4_1) confirmed "Tower Shook" (Turn 27084).
- **Tracker Update:** `suicune_tracker_v2` confirms the Wise Trio stage is bypassed/complete and Suicune is waiting on Tin Tower 1F (Turn 27090).
- **Current Objective:** Battle Suicune on 1F.
- **Battle Prep:** Switch Gastly (XENON) to lead for Hypnosis/Mean Look.
- **Wise Trio Sages on 1F:** Gaku (11, 11), Masa (14, 6), Koji (5, 9). Talk to all to ensure Suicune spawns.

## Tile Mechanics - Global
- **FLOOR**: Standard walkable tile. Traversable.
- **WALL / VOID / HEADBUTT_TREE**: Impassable terrain.
- **WATER**: Traversable via SURF.
- **CUT_TREE**: Requires CUT to clear.
- **LEDGE_HOP / LEDGE**: One-way traversal (jump). Impassable from most directions.
- **DOOR / STAIRS / LADDER**: Warp tiles.
- **WARP_CARPET**: Map transition tile.

## Key Discoveries & Lessons Learned
- **Dialogue Triggers:** "The Tin Tower shook!" is the definitive narrative flag that all overworld sightings are complete.
- **Sequential Requirements:** Clear Bell + Sightings -> "Shook" dialogue -> Wise Trio Battle -> Suicune Encounter.
- **NPC Solidity:** NPCs are solid objects; paths must detour around them.
- **Map Transitions:** Leaving a map from specific coordinates triggers transitions (e.g., Ecruteak (18, 11) -> Tin Tower Gatehouse).
- **Wise Trio Location:** They are supposed to be in Map 4_2, but were not found there on Turn 27087. Re-checking prerequisites.
