# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement. One-way ledge jumping North. Found at (10, 48), (12, 50).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. One-way ledge jumping South. Found at (10, 15).
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- Start Turn: 49771
- Start Time: 3:29 PM

## Strategy: The Great Southern Loop (Final)
The Western Corridor (X=0-2) provides a clear path to the northern plateau, but is only accessible from the southern edge (Row 51).
1. Surf South from (24, 16) to (24, 51). (In Progress)
2. Land at (23, 51).
3. Walk West along Row 51 to (2, 51) to enter the Western Corridor.
4. Walk North through the corridor to (2, 10).
5. Walk East along Row 10 to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune sighting.

# Progress Notes
- Verified: Land route to the plateau is blocked by one-way ledges (Row 48/50).
- Verified: Central Pool (X=12-17) is an enclosed buoy pocket.
- Verified: Western Corridor (X=0-2) is clear from Row 51 to Row 10.
- Note: Out of Repels. Running from wild encounters.
- Hypothesis: (14, 10) is the trigger point for the Suicune sighting.

# Reflection Turn (49827)
- Immediate Execution: Re-pivoting to the Great Southern Loop via sea. The land route is blocked by one-way ledges, and the northern sea is a complex buoy maze. Row 51 is the only verified clear East-West path.
- Notepad Hygiene: Cleaned up redundant logs and unverified hypotheses.
- Automation: Proceeding with manual navigation.
