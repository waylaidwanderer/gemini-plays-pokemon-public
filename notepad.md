# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The West Beach Land Route (Exploration Phase)
- Plan:
  1. Walk Up to (6, 24). [IN PROGRESS]
  2. Walk Left to (4, 24).
  3. Walk Up to (4, 22).
  4. Walk Left to (2, 22) (West Beach Corridor).
  5. Walk North to Row 10.
  6. Walk East to (14, 10).
- Status: At (6, 33), heading North.
- Reasoning: Direct West access at Row 31 is blocked by a wall at (5, 31). Row 35 appears to be a clear corridor to the West Beach.
