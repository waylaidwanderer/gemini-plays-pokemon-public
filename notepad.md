# Suicune Capture Strategy
## The Repel Trick
- Method: Super Repel filters wild Pokemon (Lv 13-16). Suicune (Lv 40) is the only possible encounter.
- Lead: KIMCHI (Lv 21 Gloom). Moves: ABSORB, SWEET SCENT, CUT, SLEEP POWDER.
- Strategy: Pace in tall grass on Route 38. Suicune is confirmed on this route.
- Battle Prep: Suicune (Base Speed 85) outspeeds KIMCHI (Base Speed 40). It will likely flee Turn 1.
- Catch Rate: ~0.39% (Full HP, No Status, Great Ball). ~4.3% if asleep.
- Analysis: Calcifer (Lv 45, Base 100) outspeeds Suicune but lacks status moves.
- Plan: Pivot now to catching a fast Sleep/Trap user (e.g., Gastly/Haunter in Sprout Tower at night). Current pacing strategy with KIMCHI is inefficient due to speed deficit.

## Strategy for Catching Suicune
1. Pivot: Fly to Violet City and enter Sprout Tower (currently Night).
2. Catch a Gastly.
3. Train Gastly to Lv 13+ (learns Mean Look) and ensure it has enough Speed (Base 80/95) to outspeed Suicune (Base 85).
4. Encounter Suicune, use Mean Look, then Hypnosis.

## Hunting Session Tracking
- Sprout Tower Hunt Start: Turn #13848
- Current Location: Sprout Tower 1F (Turn #13858)
- Target: Gastly (Night only)
- Strategy: Use KIMCHI's Sleep Powder, then Great Ball.
- Total Great Balls: 40

## Strategy Notes
- Roamer Logic: Suicune moves routes ONLY when crossing map boundaries (Route 38/39 edge), using Fly, or after a battle with it.
- Boundary: Route 38 (0, 10) <-> Route 39 (19, 10).
- Efficiency: Use the `pacer` tool to automate hunting. Check Pokédex every 50-100 steps.
- Gastly Goal: Mean Look (Lv 13) prevents Suicune from fleeing. Hypnosis (Lv 1) for status.
- Speed Check: Gastly (Base 80) / Haunter (Base 95) vs Suicune (Base 85). Haunter is preferred for guaranteed outspeeding.
