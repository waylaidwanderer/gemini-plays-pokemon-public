# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026
- Current Location: Route 35 (East Side)

### Immediate Goals
1. **Heal Party**: Loop back to Goldenrod via West Route 35.
2. **Get SquirtBottle**: Visit Flower Shop after healing.
3. **Find Sudowoodo**: North on Route 36.

### Navigation Logic
- **Route 35**: Divided East/West. Connection likely North or South. Code suggests connection exists.
- **The Crossing**: Likely North based on "unseen" gap candidates.
- **Flower Shop Back Door**: Located at (9, 33) in Goldenrod, accessible from Route 35 West?

### Quest Log
- **Badges**: Zephyr, Hive, Plain.
- **Party**: Garnet (Fainted), Basil (Fainted), Pearl (Fainted), Amethyst (14), Amber (24), Spider (Fainted).
- **Mail Quest**: Active.

### Strategic Notes
- **East Alley Item**: Item Ball at (13, 16) in Goldenrod East Alley blocked by trees.
- **Route 35 Navigation**: Need to reach X < 12 to return to Goldenrod Main St.
- Correction: The crossing from East to West in Goldenrod Alley is at Row 8/9. I missed it by walking South.
- Navigation Update: The wall at Col 12 is solid. Must backtrack North to Row 9 to cross to West side.
