# Reflection (Turn 35564)
- **Menu Hygiene:** "Macro" sequences with `sleep` are safer, but visual confirmation is best. "Intermediate States" can be confusing; trust "Current Screen Text".
- **Economics:** Super Repel (500g/200steps = 2.5g/step) is more efficient than Max Repel (700g/250steps = 2.8g/step). Prioritize Super Repels.
- **Status:** Turn 35565 - At (11, 5). Facing Right to interact with Clerk via Counter. Goal: Buy 4 Super Repels (Efficiency > Max Repel).
- **Goal:** Buy Super Repels (preferred) or Max Repels.

- **Goal:** Catch Raikou/Entei.

- **Mart Stock:** Ecruteak has no Repels. Goldenrod 2F has them.
