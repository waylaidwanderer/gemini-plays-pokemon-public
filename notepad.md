# Quest Log
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Status:** Exploring Mt. Silver Cave 1F.
- **Next:** Traverse Cave to Red.

# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Location:** Silver Cave Room 1.
- **Status:** Verifying Central North Path.
- **Action:** Navigate to (8, 14) and attempt to move North to (8, 13).
- **Reasoning:** Previous attempt to move North from (8, 14) was interrupted by a battle and not definitively proven to be blocked. If (8, 14) is passable Northbound, it opens the central path. If blocked, I will pivot to testing Southbound access at (8, 34) via (9, 33).
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.

# Tile Mechanics
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN:** One-way South.
- **LEDGE_HOP_LEFT:** One-way Left.
- **WARP_CARPET:** Step on to exit map.
- **CUT_TREE:** Obstacle unless Cut is used.
- **PIT:** Drops player to floor below.
- **LADDER:** Transitions between floors.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Walkable from South/Sides. Northbound exit is BLOCKED (Verified at 8,14). Acts as a one-way ledge preventing Northward movement.
- **BUOY:** Water boundary/Wall.
