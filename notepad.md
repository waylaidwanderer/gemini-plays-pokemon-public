### Immediate Goals
1. **Find Floria**: Go to National Park/Route 36 (near Sudowoodo) and talk to the NPC (likely Floria).
2. **Get SquirtBottle**: Return to Goldenrod Flower Shop after finding Floria.
3. **Move Sudowoodo**: Use SquirtBottle on the tree to clear the path to Ecruteak.

### Quest Log
- **Badges**: Zephyr, Hive, Plain.
- **Party**: All Healthy.
- **Mail Quest**: Active.

### Strategic Notes
- **Navigation**: Head North to the Gatehouse at (15, 0) to reach Route 35. The tree shortcut was a false lead.
- **SquirtBottle**: Requires finding Floria first.
- **Floria**: Last seen/rumored near the "wiggly tree" (Sudowoodo).
