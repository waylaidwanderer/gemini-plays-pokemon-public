- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement. Passable from SOUTH to NORTH. Verified: Row 34, 48, 50 block downward progress.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at Row 15 (X=3-17).
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- Started: Turn 49630
## Strategy: Sea Route Bypass (Priority)
Reach (14, 10) by surfing around the city via the eastern buoy gaps.
1. Navigate to (23, 33) and land if necessary.
2. Use SUPER REPEL.
3. SURF and move North to (27, 9) (Gap in Row 9 buoy wall).
4. Surf West and land at the northern plateau (likely X=16, Row 11-12).
5. Walk to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune sighting.

# Progress Notes
- Blocked: All land bypasses (Row 48/50, Row 34/35) are blocked by south-facing ledges (FLOOR_UP_WALL).

- Verified: (27, 9) is a gap in the buoy walls.
- SUPER REPEL is active (Turn 49722).
