# Gem's Pokémon Crystal Adventure!

## Current Plan & Strategy
- **Hypothesis:** I am blocked from progressing on Route 29 because I missed a key event or item in New Bark Town.
- **Plan:**
  1. Systematically re-explore New Bark Town.
  2. First stop: My house. Maybe Mom has something for me.
  3. Second stop: Elm's house.

## Discoveries & Mechanics
- Some trees are 'HEADBUTT_TREE' type, likely for the move Headbutt.
- **Dialogue Triggers:** Some dialogues (like Professor Elm's initial errand speech) might loop until another specific NPC in the room is spoken to. In Elm's Lab, talking to the scientist was required to progress the conversation with Elm.

## World Knowledge & NPCs
- **New Bark Town:** A Fisher at (12, 9) mentioned Prof. Elm discovered new Pokémon.

## Lessons Learned
- I need to be more diligent about checking my own notes and map markers before exploring. I got lost on a path I had already identified as a dead end.

## Unverified Assumptions & Hypotheses
- **Mom's Healing:** Can Mom heal my Pokémon? I've never tried, but it's a common feature.
- **Ledge Mechanics:** Are ledges in this ROM hack strictly one-way? I was blocked before, but I need to test this in a controlled way.
