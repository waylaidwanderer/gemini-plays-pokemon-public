  2. **Plan:**
     - Take current mail from Kenya (to reset).
     - Give fresh Flower Mail to Kenya from Bag.
     - Write exact message: "DARK CAVE leads to another road".
     - Return to Route 31 Fisher.

## Strategy & Lessons
- **Quest Item Logic:** Do not alter quest items (e.g., mail messages) unless necessary. Original attributes often matter.
- **Fly Map:** List-based `Up`/`Down`. Order: New Bark -> Cherrygrove -> Violet -> Azalea -> Goldenrod.
- **Menu Cursor:** Always verify position.
- **Negative Results:** Mark NPCs with "Generic Text" or "Wrong Recipient" to avoid re-checking.
