# Completed Missions
- **Radio Tower:** Defeated Team Rocket, rescued Director, got Clear Bell.
- **Wise Trio:** Defeated in Barrier Station.

# Suicune Hunt (Tin Tower 1F)
- **Status:** Suicune is NOT visible at (9,9) after map reload.
- **Hypothesis:** 
    1. Suicune is now roaming (check Pokedex).
    2. Event is failed/complete (check Wise Trio for dialogue change).
- **Observation:** Pokedex search for "Water" found only Poliwag and Gyarados. Suicune is NOT registered as "Seen" or is not in the search results.
- **Inference:** Suicune is NOT roaming.
- **Hypothesis:** 
    1. I must use the **Clear Bell** manually at the spawn point (9,9).
    2. I must speak to the **Wise Trio** (Barrier Station) or **Eusine** to reset the event.
    3. Suicune is gone until I beat the Elite Four (Worst Case).
- **Action:** 
    1. Go to (9,9) and use Clear Bell.
    2. If fail, backtrack to Barrier Station and talk to Wise Trio.

# Map Markers

# Suicune Battle Plan
- **Level:** 40
- **Moves:** Bubblebeam, Gust, Leer, Rain Dance.
- **Strategy:** Gyarados (Dragon Rage x3) -> Sleep (Lapis/Lucid).

# Verification Log
- Checked (10,2): Not a warp.
- Checked Sage (5,9): No battle.
- Checked Sage (14,6): No battle.
- **Action:** Exited Tin Tower. Re-entering immediately to check for Suicune respawn.
- **Action:** Walking to (9,10) to confirm Suicune's presence.
- **Concern:** Since I whited out in the previous battle, there is a risk Suicune has despawned permanently or moved. Gen 2 mechanics on white-outs vs legendaries are unforgiving.
- **Observation:** Verified Suicune is not roaming via Pokedex.
- **Plan:** Attempting to reach (9,9) via the top entrance at Row 3/4. Inspecting wall at (10,4) to see if it opened after talking to Sages.
- **Observation:** North wall at (10,4) is solid. No hidden door found.
- **Plan:** Checking South wall at (10,10) and (9,10). Navigating via right side.
- **Observation:** South wall at (10,10) is solid.
- **Plan:** Exploring the Top-Left corner at (3,2). Looking for hidden stairs or switches.
- **Hypothesis:** If the center is sealed and Suicune is gone, I must need to go up to 2F. Stairs might be in the corner.
- **Correction:** The center room (7,5 to 12,9) is completely sealed by walls. I cannot physically reach (9,9).
- **Plan Adjustment:** I cannot use the Clear Bell at (9,9). I will try using it at the "Mystery Warp" (10,2) or near the Sages if corner exploration fails.
- **Current Task:** Inspecting (3,1) and (3,9).
