### Current Objectives & Strategy
- **Main Quest**: Begin the Gym Challenge (Violet City).
- **Immediate Goal**: Reach Cherrygrove City.
- **Healing**: Mom (New Bark) does NOT heal. Elm did NOT heal. Relied on Berries.
- **Status**: Party HP Critical. Need Pokemon Center.

### Route 29 Navigation
- **Finding**: Lower and Middle lanes are dead ends or blocked by Cut Trees.
- **Solution**: The correct Westbound route is the Upper Path (Row 6), accessed via the East side near New Bark Town.
- **Item**: Found item at (48, 2) blocked by Cut Tree.

### Tile Mechanics
- **TYPE_c453**: One-Way Ledge (East/South depending on context).
- **TYPE_2889**: Tree Wall (Solid).
- **TYPE_5519**: Cut Tree (Requires HM01).

### Key Locations
- **Cherrygrove City**: Pokemon Center, Mart.
- **Route 30**: Path to Violet City.

### Mechanics
- **Ledges**: Jump South (usually). Or East? Route 29 has specific directional ledges?
- **Cut Trees**: Require Badge 2 + HM01.
- Aide in New Bark Town (after Lab) gives Pokegear tutorial, NOT Potions.
- Confirmed: Must travel to Cherrygrove to heal.
### Route 29 Lane Analysis
- **Top Lane (Rows 4-9)**: Blocked by Cut Tree at (30, 9)? Needs verification.
- **Middle Lane (Rows 10-12)**: Blocked by Cut Tree at (21, 11).
- **Bottom Lane (Rows 14-17)**: Currently testing. Suspect Dead End at x=13.
- **Hypothesis**: If all lanes are blocked, there must be a diagonal switch or a specific gap I missed. 
- **Immediate Task**: Verify collision of 'TYPE_2889' (Tree texture) at (20, 16). If solid, x=0-12 on Row 14 is likely a wall.
