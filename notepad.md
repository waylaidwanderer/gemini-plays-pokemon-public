- **Plan**: Go East to Main Road -> South to Row 23 -> West to x=9 -> South to Row 29 -> Enter Underground (11, 29).

- **Timestamp**: Turn 8086.

### Quests
- **Sister's House**: (29, 5). The sister is missing (Route 36).
- **Route 35 Gatehouse**: East Side (x=31) is a dead end.
- **Plan**: Bypass blocker at (4, 16) via Row 18. Reach West Tracks (Column 3) and head North.

- Tracks blocked at (3, 16) by Rude Tourist.
- Plan: Execute 'South Loop' strategy. Travel South to Row 30+, move West to the tracks (x=3-4), and head North to bypass barriers.
