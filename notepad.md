# Ice Path Strategy
- **Current State:** At Ice Path B1F (3, 14).
- **Goal:** Explore B1F West Corridor.
- **Observations:**
  - The ladder at (3, 15) is in a section separated from the rest of the room by a wall at x=2 (North of y=14).
  - I must go West to x=1, then North.
  - The Pit at (5, 12) is currently unreachable (separated by walls).
- **Plan:**
  1. Walk to (1, 14).
  2. Walk North along x=1 as far as possible.
  3. Look for a gap in the wall at x=2 to access the eastern part of the room.

# Map Structure
- **B1F Room:** Divided into West Corridor (x=0-1) and East Room (x=3+).
- **1F:** Solved North Ice Room and East Ice Puzzle.
- **Item Ball (35, 9) on 1F:** Still uncollected. Likely needs B1F boulder puzzle solution.
