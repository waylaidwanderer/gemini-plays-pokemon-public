# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Current Task
- **Map 4_5**: Dance Theater Interior.
- **Action**: In the lobby. Moving to the stage to fight the Kimono Girls.
- **Status**: Revive (used), Super Potion (x3) left. Money: ¥10.
- **Correction**: I do NOT have TM28 (Dig). Plan: Rely on Flame Wheel (90 BP with STAB) vs Mud-Slap (40 BP with SE).
- **Next**: Exit Mart -> Kimono Girls (Dance Theater).

- **Battle Plan**:
  1. **Rocket Grunt**: Defeat him to save the girl.
    - **Issue**: Dialogue loop/Restarting? Player facing UP?
    - **Fix**: Press B to close dialogue, Turn DOWN, Interact.
  2. **Kimono Girls**: Defeat all 5 for Surf.
  - **Strategy**: Garnet (Lv34) Flame Wheel sweep.
  - **Status**: Garnet (Healthy). Topaz (Healed).
- **Reflection (Turn 14780)**:
  - **Progress**: Arrived at Dance Theater.
  - **Goal**: Win these battles.
  - **Lesson**: Manual healing was faster than debugging the Joy loop. Adaptability wins.
