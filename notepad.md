# Suicune Capture Strategy
## The Repel Trick (Active)
- **Lead:** KIMCHI (Lv 21 Gloom).
- **Setup:** Use Super Repel to filter out wild Pokémon (Lv 13-16). Since Suicune is Lv 40, it will be the only encounter triggered.
- **Pacing Area:** Route 38 tall grass.
- **Roamer Logic:** Suicune moves routes ONLY when crossing map boundaries (e.g., Route 38/39 edge), using Fly, or after a battle. Pacing/Battling other Pokémon does NOT move it.

## Battle Plan (vs Suicune Lv 40)
- Suicune Base Speed: 85. Gloom Base Speed: 40.
- **Turn 1:** Suicune will likely flee.
- **Strategy:**
  1. Chip damage and status are persistent across encounters.
  2. Aim to inflict Sleep (Sleep Powder) to prevent fleeing on Turn 1 in subsequent encounters.
  3. **Contingency:** If progress stalls after 5 encounters, catch a faster Pokémon with Mean Look or Hypnosis (e.g., Haunter).
- **Capture Probability:** 0.39% (Base HP, No Status, Great Ball). Using Sleep Powder is the priority.

## Route 38 Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR:** Traversable. Standard ground.
- **WALL / HEADBUTT_TREE:** Impassable.
- **TALL_GRASS:** Traversable. Triggers wild encounters. Repel Trick filters based on lead level.
- **LEDGE_HOP (DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT):** One-way traversable (downwards/leftwards/rightwards). Confirmed by observation.
- **WARP_CARPET:** Traversable. Triggers map transition.
