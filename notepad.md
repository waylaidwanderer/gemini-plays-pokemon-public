# Ice Path Strategy
- **Current State:** At Ice Path B1F (2, 14).
- **Goal:** Explore B1F West Corridor.
- **Observations:**
  - Walls at x=2 block direct access to the Pit at (5, 12).
  - The West Corridor (x=0-1) extends North.
- **Plan:**
  1. Walk to (1, 14).
  2. Walk North to (1, 10) and beyond to reveal the map.
  3. Look for Boulders or a path wrapping around to the East.

# Map Structure
- **B1F Room:** Divided into West Corridor (x=0-1) and East Room (x=3+).
- **1F:** Solved North Ice Room and East Ice Puzzle.
- **Item Ball (35, 9) on 1F:** Still uncollected. Likely needs B1F boulder puzzle solution.
