# Mechanics
- **Battle Cursor:** Remembers last move used.
- **Fly Map:** Visual Map (Cursor based). Use D-pad to select city. **Cursor persists:** Always verify "Currently selected destination" text before confirming flight.
- **Roaming Beasts:** Check Pokegear Map for current location.

# Strategic Status
- **Goal:** Register Raikou & Entei.
- **Current Task:** Hunt Roaming Beasts.
- **Location:** Ecruteak City.
- **Action:** Hunt Loop: Transition to Route 37 to shift Roamers.
- **Hunt Progress:** ~48 loops. Started Turn 39717.

# Strategy (Hunt Loop)
1.  **Transit:** Enter Saffron City -> Magnet Train Station.
2.  **Transit:** Take Magnet Train from Saffron to Goldenrod (Johto).
3.  **Setup:** Fly to Ecruteak City. Ensure Gyarados (Lv 37) is leading.
4.  **Hunt:** Move between Route 37 and Ecruteak City to shift Roamers.
    - Check Pokegear Map each time.
    - If a Beast is on Route 37, use **Max Repel** and enter grass.
    - If no encounter, return to City and repeat.
5.  **Encounter:**
    - **Raikou/Entei:** They flee immediately.
    - **Plan:** Sleep (if possible) or heavy hit. Master Ball is an option if desperate, but saving for one is better.
    - *Note:* Roamers retain damage/status.

# Resources
- **Money:** ¥15644.
- **Items:** Max Repel x30.
- **Key Items:** Pass (Magnet Train).
- **Status:** Beasts on Rt 38 & 42 (Turn 39854). Moving to Ecruteak.

# Reflection (Turn 39822)
- **Lesson:** Start Menu cursor remembers position. Pokegear also likely remembers last tab. Always verify or reset state.
- **Hypothesis:** Roamers might be stuck in a 38-42 loop. If hunt stalls >60 loops, consider moving to Mahogany/Violet to disrupt pattern.
- **Check:** Confirmed I can see Beasts on Pokegear Map despite not battling them in wild yet. Burned Tower event was sufficient.
