# Quest Log
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Status:** Exploring Mt. Silver Cave 1F.
- **Next:** Traverse Cave to Red.

# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Location:** Silver Cave Room 1.
- **Status:** Executing "The Grand Loop" to West Edge.
- **Action:** Navigate to (3, 21), then South to (3, 32).
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Northbound progress is blocked by "Floor_Up_Wall" tiles at Row 28/34 (Center/East) and Row 14/20 (Center). 
  2. The only open Northbound path is likely Column 0 (West Edge).
  3. To reach Col 0, I must reach the bottom open area (Row 32/35).
  4. The only path to the bottom from here is via the West side ledges (Col 3).
  5. Path: (8, 27) -> North to Row 21 -> West to Col 3 -> South to Row 32 -> West to Col 0 -> North to Destination.
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.

# Tile Mechanics

- **LEDGE_HOP_LEFT:** One-way Left.
- **WARP_CARPET:** Step on to exit map.
- **CUT_TREE:** Obstacle unless Cut is used.

- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Walkable from South/Sides. Northbound exit is BLOCKED (Verified at 8,14). Acts as a one-way ledge preventing Northward movement.
