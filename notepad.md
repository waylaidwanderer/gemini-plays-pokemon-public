# Gem's Pokémon Crystal Journey

## Current Goals
- [ ] Defeat Rival Silver (Immediate)
- [ ] Enter Ilex Forest (Primary)
- [ ] Hatch the Mystery Egg (Secondary)

## Quest Log
- **Badges:** Zephyr (Violet), Hive (Azalea).
- **Events:**
  - Defeated Rival Silver (Cherrygrove).
  - Cleared Sprout Tower (Flash) & Slowpoke Well.
  - Defeated Leader Bugsy.
  - Paprika evolved into Quilava.
  - Received Mystery Egg.

## Game Mechanics
- Saving Money: Mom saves a portion of winnings.
- COUNTER: Impassable object. Interact from the front to speak with NPCs behind it.
- LADDER: Warps between floors.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Context-dependent. Acts as a ramp (climbable South->North) and ridge (walkable horizontally) in Union Cave.

## Strategy Notes
- Team Strategy: Paprika (Quilava) is the carry. Basalt (Geodude) needs training.
- Tactics: Smokescreen vs physical attackers.
- Survival Strategy: Against strong/type-advantaged opponents (e.g. Rival's Croconaw), stacking accuracy debuffs (e.g. Smokescreen x6) is a verified effective survival tactic.
- Protocol: Mark NPCs immediately.

## Route 46 (Southern Section)
- Connections: South to Route 29/46 Gate.
- Wild Pokémon: Rattata (Lv 3), Geodude (Lv 2), Spearow (Lv 2).
- Geography: Southern area separated from North by one-way ledges at Row 19. Northern area currently inaccessible from here.
- Sign at (9, 27): "MOUNTAIN RD. AHEAD".
- Traversal: TALL_GRASS is traversable.
- Discovery: Caught Geodude (Basalt) in grass at (5, 26).

## Lessons Learned
