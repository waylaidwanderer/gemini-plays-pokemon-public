# Moveset Status (Muscle)

# Strategy: The "Revive Anchor"
1. **Goal:** Muscle must fight to the death.
2. **Constraint:** **NEVER SWITCH GYARADOS IN.**
   - Gyarados is the *only* remaining Pokemon who can use the last Revive on Muscle.
   - If Gyarados switches in and dies, we lose the Revive ability and the game.
3. **Loop:**
   - Muscle Struggles.
   - If Muscle faints -> Send Gyarados -> Revive Muscle -> Gyarados faints -> Muscle returns.
