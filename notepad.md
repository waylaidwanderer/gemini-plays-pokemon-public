# I. Core Principles & Lessons Learned
- **Immediate Maintenance is Paramount:** I must be vigilant in performing maintenance tasks (notepad, agents, tools) immediately. Deferring them is a critical process failure.
- **Agent Trust is Mandatory:** I MUST trust my custom agents' advice, even if it contradicts my own intuition. Their purpose is to perform complex reasoning I cannot. If an agent is wrong, I must refine it, not ignore it.
- **Tool Trust is Mandatory:** My `pathfinder` tool wasn't broken; my understanding of the map was. I assumed the tool was failing because it didn't match my visual interpretation. **Lesson:** Trust the tool's output over visual inspection, as it reads the ground-truth map data.
- **Disprove Hypotheses:** I must actively try to prove my own assumptions wrong, not just seek confirmation. When I thought my pathfinder was broken, I should have tested the hypothesis "What if the tool is right and I'm wrong?" This would have revealed I was trapped much sooner.

# II. Future Development Ideas
- **Faint Strategist Agent:** A potential new agent could specialize in planning the most efficient way to black out. It would analyze the party, the opponent, and available moves to recommend the fastest sequence of faints.
- **Map Connectivity Tool:** A computational tool (not an agent) to analyze the map XML and check for connectivity between two points, accounting for impassable tiles. This would be useful for definitively confirming if an area is isolated.

# III. Game Mechanics & Battle Intel

## A. Tile Mechanics & Traversal Rules
- **Ground/Impassable:** `ground` tiles are walkable, `impassable` tiles are solid walls. All objects (NPCs, items, signs) function as impassable walls, except for Pikachu.
- **Grass:** Walkable tiles where wild Pokémon can be encountered.
- **Water:** Surfable tiles. To initiate SURF, I must be **facing the water** on a `ground` or `steps` tile and then use the move from the party menu.
- **Ledges:** One-way only. Can be jumped down (from Y-1 to Y+2 in one move), but are impassable from below (Y+1) and from the sides (X-1, X+1).
- **Spinner Tiles:** Force movement in a specific direction. 
- **Warp Tiles:** Instantaneous teleporters between maps or within the same map. Must step off and back on to reuse.
- **Hole Tiles:** One-way warps that cause the player to fall to the floor below, often into isolated areas.
- **Steps:** Allows vertical movement between `ground` and `elevated_ground` tiles.
- **Elevated Ground:** Walkable ground at a different elevation, accessible only via `steps`.
- **Cuttable:** A tree that can be cut with HM Cut. Becomes `ground` after cutting.
- **Secret Switches:** Some statues contain hidden switches. Activating them can toggle the state of nearby gates, opening new paths. 
- **Positional Triggers:** Specific tiles that, when stepped on, can open or close gates or trigger other events elsewhere on the map. 
- **Gate Offscreen/Closed/Open:** Gates whose state (unknown, impassable, or passable) depends on whether they are on-screen and whether a controlling switch has been activated.
- **Scripted Event Tiles:** Some tiles trigger events. The tile in front of the Cinnabar Gym door (19, 5) pushes the player back and displays a 'locked' message. The water on Seafoam Islands B4F has a scripted current that prevents surfing south.
- **Hidden Passages:** Some maps contain hidden passages that allow traversal through what appear to be solid walls.
- **Invisible Barriers:** Some areas contain invisible, impassable barriers that are not tied to a specific tile type.

## B. Confirmed ROM Hack Changes
### B1. Type Matchups & Immunities
- **Super Effective:** Psychic > Ghost/Poison; Ghost > Psychic; Electric > Rock/Water; CUT (Normal) > VICTREEBEL (Grass/Poison); Flying > Grass/Poison; Psychic > Flying; Ice > Ground; Ground > Poison; Ground > Fire; Rock > Fire
- **Not Very Effective:** Normal !> Psychic; Electric !> Grass; Rock !> Ground; Psychic !> Psychic; Bite (Normal) !> HAUNTER (Ghost/Poison); Ice !> Gyarados (Water/Flying); Poison !> Poison; Ice !> Water; Poison !> Ground
- **Immunities:** Flying-type immune to Ground-type moves; Ground-type Pokémon are immune to Electric-type moves; MUK immune to Poison-type moves; HYPNO immune to STUN SPORE (powder moves); MUK immune to THUNDER WAVE (Electric-type status move).

### B2. Battle & Field Mechanics
- **Evasion:** PSYWAVE and CONFUSE RAY can fail against targets with high evasion boosts.
- **'No Will to Fight':** A fainted or sleeping Pokémon cannot be switched into battle.
- **Safari Zone:** Has a time limit. When it expires, the player is warped back to the Safari Zone Gate.
- **Gym Battle Loss:** Losing a battle inside a gym does NOT warp you to a Pokémon Center.
- **Run from Battle Mechanic:** Attempting to switch Pokémon from the party screen can sometimes result in running from the battle instead.
- **FLY in battle:** The move FLY can be used to defeat a wild Pokémon and end the battle, even when indoors. This acts as an escape method.
- **ROAR in battle:** Can end a wild battle by forcing the player's Pokémon to run away.

# IV. Active Puzzles & Solved Puzzles

## A. Pokemon Mansion - SECRET KEY (Active)
- **Goal:** Find the SECRET KEY to unlock the Cinnabar Gym.
- **Current Hypothesis:** The key is located in a hidden area of the mansion, accessible only after solving a complex puzzle involving switches and positional triggers across multiple floors. I am currently trapped in a dead-end section of 1F and must black out to escape and re-evaluate my approach.

## B. Pokemon Mansion - Solved Puzzles
- **1F Gate Puzzle:** The switches on 1F and 2F have a combined effect. To open the eastern gates at (25, 14), first activate the switch on 2F at (3, 12), then activate the switch on 1F at (3, 6).
