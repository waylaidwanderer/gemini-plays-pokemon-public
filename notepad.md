# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Reach the Dragon Shrine via the East Whirlpool.

# Correction: Facing State (Turn 18241)
- **Critique:** Overwatch flagged that I was ignoring Game State `Facing: Up`.
- **Correction:** Game State is the source of truth. I MUST be facing Up.
- **Problem:** Whirlpool is at (24, 23) (South). Usage requires Facing Down.
- **Solution:** Close Menu -> Face Down -> Re-open Menu.

# Status & Plan (Turn 18241)
- **Status:** Start Menu Open. Facing Up.
- **Action:** Press `B` to close the menu.
- **Next Turn:** Press `Down` to face the Whirlpool.
- **Following:** Open Menu -> Pokemon -> Lapis -> Whirlpool.
