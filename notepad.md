# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Stop Team Rocket.
- **Secondary Goal:** Find Team Rocket Uniform.
- **Tertiary Goal:** Investigate Locked Door in Underground (18, 6).
- **Navigation:** Exit Game Corner, then return to Underground South Entrance (11, 29).

## Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR:** Standard walkable tile.
- **WALL:** Impassable collision.
- **COUNTER:** Impassable, interactable from adjacent tile.
- **LADDER:** Warp to another map/floor.
- **WARP CARPET:** Transition to adjacent map (usually at edges).

## Key Information
- **Radio Tower:** Entrance at (33, 9) in Goldenrod. Blocked by a Rocket Grunt who demands a Uniform.
- **Underground:** 
    - "No Entry" door at (18, 6) requires a key or switch.
    - Super Nerd at (19, 27) warned of rough battles.
- **Obstacles:**
    - Rocket Grunt at (16, 23) in Goldenrod blocks shortcut.
    - Rocket Grunt at (31, 10) in Goldenrod blocks Radio Tower.

## Active Quests/Leads
- **Uniform:** Needed to enter Radio Tower. Likely in the Underground or with a specific NPC.
- Info: Super Nerd at (3, 27) is the Older Haircut Brother.
- Plan: Check ladder at (3, 34) leading to Switch Room Entrances.
- Status: Descending via South Ladder (5, 25) to Underground Tunnel.
- Note: Map markers indicate I've defeated the Super Nerds here before.
- Strategy: Check Donald for new info, then proceed to Warehouse (Ladder at 3, 34) to look for the Uniform.
- Info: Donald is just a tipster (Hiker Anthony). Not the Uniform source.
- Status: Heading to South Ladder (3, 34) to investigate "Switch Room Entrances".
- Hypothesis: Underground is split into West (Tunnel) and East (Basement) sections.
- Plan: Exit to Goldenrod via South exit, then look for the East entrance to reach the Locked Door area.
- Hypothesis: The section of the Underground with the Uniform/Locked Door is accessible via the Department Store Basement.
- Info: Rocket Grunt at (16, 23) is a non-battling blocker.
- Insight: Goldenrod is divided by the train tracks. The West side (where I am) is isolated. The Rocket Grunt at (16, 23) blocks the only surface crossing.
- Plan: Use the Underground to cross to the East side (Dept Store Basement).
- Correction: I previously stuck to the West wall of the Underground. I must explore EAST in the Main Underground (3_53) to find the Dept Store entrance.
- Correction: The Underground Entrance room (3_54) is split into two unconnected halves. I cannot cross here.
- Plan: Descend to Main Underground (3_53) and look for a path to the East side of that map, which likely leads to the Dept Store Basement.
- Hypothesis Test: Checking if the Underground West tunnel has any openings to the East side.
- Plan: Hug the right wall while moving North. If no opening is found, assume the tunnels are separate and I must access the East side from the surface (Department Store).
- Map Discovery: The Underground Tunnel (3_53) connects to two separate rooms in 3_54.
    - South Ladder (3, 34 in 3_53) -> West Room (x=5 in 3_54) -> Exits to Goldenrod South.
    - North Ladder (3, 2 in 3_53) -> East Room (x=21 in 3_54) -> Likely exits to Goldenrod North/East.
- Navigation Correction: Row 8 and 9 are open paths crossing West-to-East in Goldenrod. The Grunt at (16, 23) only blocks the southern shortcut.
- Plan: Walk East along Row 8 to reach the Department Store.
