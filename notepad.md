# Suicune Quest
- Start Turn: 46650
- Objective: Trigger sighting in Cianwood City at the northern shore.
- Strategy: The Middle-West Route
    1. Surf West to (20, 30) and land at (19, 30).
    2. Walk West along Row 30 to (12, 30).
    3. Walk North to (12, 28).
    4. Surf North across the pond to land at (12, 19).
    5. Walk West along Row 19 to (2, 19) (bypass rock at (4, 19) via Row 18).
    6. Walk North along X=2 to Y=4.
    7. Walk East to (7, 4) to trigger the sighting.
- Note: Ledge jumps at (6, 34), (12, 50), and (23, 46) are confirmed IMPASSABLE from the north. This route uses verified corridors.
- Suicune sighting count = 1.

# Roaming Beast Data
- Raikou: Unknown
- Entei: Unknown
- Suicune Sightings: 1 (Ecruteak), 2 (Cianwood - Pending)

# Strategy: Capture all Legendary Pokemon
- Requirements: Clear Bell (Owned), 16 Badges (Owned).
- Plan: Complete sightings -> Tin Tower -> Capture Suicune (Lv 40).

# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard walkable ground.
- WATER: Traversable only while Surfing (requires HM03).
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- WALL: Impassable obstacle.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL / LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: These specific tiles in Cianwood (6, 34), (12, 50), (23, 46) act as IMPASSABLE walls from the north. Do not attempt to jump them.
- Interaction: To Surf, face WATER from an adjacent FLOOR tile and press A. Stepping onto FLOOR from WATER automatically ends Surfing.

# Lessons Learned
- Cianwood's ledges are not standard; manual verification is required. If a jump fails once, do not repeat.
- Zig-zag buoy lines block the eastern sea. Use internal land corridors (Row 19, Row 30) for horizontal travel.
- Always reveal 'unseen' tiles manually before planning long routes through them.
