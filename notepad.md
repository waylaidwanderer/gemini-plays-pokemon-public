# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- Quest Start: Turn 48900

## Execution Plan (Southern Bypass)
1. Walk to (23, 32) and use Surf. <- CURRENT TASK
2. Surf South to Row 51, then West to (2, 51).
3. Land at (2, 51) and walk North to (2, 14).
4. Walk East to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

## Strategy: Southern Bypass
Terrestrial paths to the western corridor are blocked by multiple upward ledge lines (Row 34, 46, 48, 50). The only way to reach the plateau is to Surf around the south end of the map to Row 51, where the land is accessible from the water. This provides access to the western corridor (X=2), which is a clear path to the northern plateau.

## Tile Mechanics (Cianwood)
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way ledge. Blocks South movement. (Verified at Row 34, 46, 48, 50).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way ledge. Blocks North movement.

## Failed Hypotheses & Lessons
- Terrestrial Center Path: Blocked by upward ledges at Row 34.
- Inner Channel (X=12): Blocked at Row 15 by solid wall line (X=12-17).
- Island Hop (13, 16): Dead end pocket at (11, 14).

## Progress Summary
- All 16 Badges obtained.
- Current Focus: Suicune tracking.
