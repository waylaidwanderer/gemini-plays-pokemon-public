# Strategy: Trigger Suicune Sighting (Started: Turn 51131, Turn 51301 - Resumed)
- City Logic: Vertical walls divide the city. The Western Corridor (X=0-2) is the main land route to the north, but requires a long detour to Row 51 or using Surf to bypass walls.
- Execution Plan:
  1. Surf South to (12, 28) and land.
  2. Walk South to (12, 49), then West to (10, 49).
  3. Walk South to (10, 51) to reach the southern highway.
  4. Walk West to (2, 51) to reach the Western Corridor.
  5. Walk North to (2, 12), then East to (14, 12).
  6. Walk North to (14, 10) for the Suicune sighting.

# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard traversable tile.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable collision.
- WATER: Traversable only while using SURF.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way passage (South only). Jump FROM ledge to tile below.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way passage (North only). Walk ONTO from south or walk North from it.
- ROCK (Object): Impassable until cleared with ROCK SMASH.
