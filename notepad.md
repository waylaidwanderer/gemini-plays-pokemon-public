## Route 10 North Progress
- (11, 1): Pokemon Center (Map 7_14).
## Route 9 Progress
- (54, 17): Transition to Route 10 North (14, 0).
- Goal: Find water access at eastern edge to Surf to Power Plant.
- Note: Building door previously at (51, 19) is actually the Pokemon Center at (11, 1) on Route 10 North.

## Strategy for Reaching Power Plant
- **Attempt 1 (Turn 39056):** Tried Route 10 North (7_14) at (14, 0). Blocked by wall at x=15.
- **Hypothesis 1:** Route 9 (7_13) has water access at (56, 4) that leads south to Route 10 North water.
- **Obstacle:** Wall at Row 5 (x=49-55+) blocks access to Row 4 from the south.
- **Plan:** Navigate west along Row 8 on Route 9 to find a gap in the Row 5 wall. Then move east along Row 4 to reach the water at (56, 4).
- **Verification:** Sign at (12, 1) in Route 10 North confirms Pokemon Center nearby; Guide at Center mentioned Power Plant is visible outside.
- **Failed Hypotheses:**
    - Gap in wall at x=15 on Route 10 North (No gap seen up to y=6).
    - Direct access to (56, 6) or (56, 7) from (54, 6) (Blocked by wall at x=55).
