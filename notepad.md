# Suicune Quest Strategy (Crystal)
- Quest Start Turn: 27180
- Route 42 Sighting Attempt 1: Turn 27570 (Failed - Sages not spoken to)
- Route 36 Sighting Attempt 1: Turn 27612 (Failed - Sages not spoken to)
- Sages Spoken To: Turn 27650 (Gaku, Koji, Masa)
- Current Status: Heading back to Route 42. In Crystal, you MUST hear the legends from the Sages in Tin Tower 1F BEFORE the Route 42 and 36 sightings will activate.
- Route 42 Sighting Attempt 2: In progress.
- Route 36 Sighting Attempt 2: Pending.
- Key Items: Clear Bell (Acquired)
- Prerequisite Strategy: Eusine must be defeated at Cianwood City north shore. (Status: Verified).
- Route 42 Trigger: (26, 15) - Small clearing with 3 Apricorn trees outside Mt. Mortar middle entrance.
- Route 36 Trigger: (35, 9) - Near the junction where Sudowoodo was.
- Final Encounter: Tin Tower (static battle) after all wild sightings and Wise Trio battle.

## Battle Strategy (Wise Trio)
- Trio will only battle after Route 42 and 36 sightings are complete.
- Lead: GNEISS (Graveler) Lv44 (Earthquake, Rollout).

## Capture Strategy (Suicune)
- Hypothesis: Suicune is a static encounter in Tin Tower (Crystal) at Lv40.
- Lead: XENON (Gastly) Lv21 (Hypnosis, Night Shade).
- **CRITICAL RISK:** Xenon is severely underleveled (Lv21 vs Lv40). Suicune will likely outspeed and KO Xenon before Hypnosis can be used. Consider training a faster/bulkier sleep inducer or using items to boost speed.
- Items: 43 Great Balls, 1 Ultra Ball.
