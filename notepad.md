# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The Sequential Gap Path (Verified)
- Plan:
  1. Surf to Gap 2 at (22, 16). [IN PROGRESS]
  2. Navigate through Gap 6 at (23, 15) to Row 14.
  3. Navigate West through Gap 4 at (19, 14) to the inner channel.
  4. Navigate to (16, 11) to land.
  5. Walk to (14, 10).
- Status: At (20, 30) surfing, heading for Gap 2.
- Reasoning: Row 15-16 is a solid buoy/cliff line except for Gap 2 (22, 16) and Gap 6 (23, 15). Gap 4 (19, 14) is the only way into the northernmost pocket.
