# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Reach the Dragon Shrine via the East Whirlpool.

# Current Status (Turn 18305)
- **Location:** Dragon's Den B1F (25, 22) (Target).
- **Facing:** Right (after move).
- **Action:** Move to (25, 22) to try the adjacent whirlpool.
- **Reasoning:** Interaction with (24, 23) failed multiple times. Trying (25, 23) to see if it works. Breaking the position loop at (24, 22).
- **Next Step:** Face Down, Interact with (25, 23). If that fails, switch Lapis to lead.

# Plan
1. Face Down (Towards Whirlpool at 25, 23).
2. Interact (A).
3. If fails, Open Menu -> Pokemon -> Switch Lapis to Slot 1.
4. Try again.

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Barrier requiring HM06. Can be removed.
- **Cage Layout:** Player seems confined in an area (x=24-26, y=20-23) bounded by walls and buoys/whirlpools. Escaping requires clearing a whirlpool.

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Requires HM06 Whirlpool + Glacier Badge. 
- **Lava/Magma:** (None here).
- **Ice:** (None here).

# Lessons
- **Menu Navigation:** Always verify cursor position before committing to a sequence. Blind input leads to wrong menus (e.g., PACK instead of POKEMON).
