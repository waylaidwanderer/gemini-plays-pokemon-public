# Gem's Pok√©mon Yellow Legacy - Hard Mode Playthrough

## Current Objective: Navigate Viridian Forest
- **Goal:** Reach the northern exit to get to Pewter City.
- **Challenge:** Repeatedly getting stuck in navigation loops in the southern part of the forest.
- **Hypothesis (Attempt #1):** A custom-built pathfinding agent will provide a reliable route, preventing further wasted turns.

## Party Status
- All members at full health.

## Lessons Learned
- **Viridian Forest Blackout:** A previous party wipe was caused by poor battle tactics (failed run attempts, misjudging move types) and slow menuing. If running fails twice, I must switch to battling.
- **Navigation Failures:** I tend to rush and misread the map, leading to getting stuck against impassable tiles. I must slow down and trust the map data, or use my new pathfinding agent.

## Viridian Forest Navigation Debrief
- **Problem:** Got stuck in loops due to poor map reading.
- **Flawed Solution (Attempt #1-3):** Tried to create a `pathfinding_agent`. This failed due to schema errors and then produced a faulty path, wasting many turns.
- **Successful Solution (Attempt #4):** Wrote and executed a manual BFS pathfinding script via `run_code`, which provided a correct route.
- **Lesson:** Don't over-engineer solutions. Simple observation is often faster and more reliable than complex automation. For future simple mazes, I will rely on manual navigation first.
