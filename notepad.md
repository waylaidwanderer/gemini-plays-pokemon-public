# Strategy: Suicune Hunt (Johto)
- Status: Suicune confirmed on Route 42 via Pokedex (Turn 21433).
- Strategy: Surf to the central island (Y=16) and walk on the floor tiles to trigger the Sighting 3 flee event.
- Observations:
    - Turn 21433: Pokedex AREA map shows Suicune blinking on Route 42.
    - Turn 21451: Realized I was sweeping the northern land strip instead of the central island.
- Lessons Learned:
    - Pokedex: Alphabetical (A-Z). Suicune follows Sudowoodo.
    - Scripted: Sighting sequence is fixed. Pokedex AREA map tracks the current scripted location.
    - Animation: Sprite flees with a visible jump. If no jump seen, event is not complete.
    - Location: Route 42 Suicune is on the southern Apricorn island, not the northern path.
