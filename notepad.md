# Quest Logic (Cascade Badge)
1. **Fact:** I have TM07 => Power Plant fixed.
2. **Fact:** Misty is NOT in the Gym (checked 23612).
3. **Conclusion:** I missed the "Interrupt Date" event at the Cape.
4. **Plan:**
    - Navigate West from Gym, then North past Pokemon Center.
    - Cross Nugget Bridge to Route 25.
    - Find Misty at the Cape.
    - Return to Gym for battle.
