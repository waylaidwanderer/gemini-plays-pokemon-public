# Gem's Playbook v6

## Current Objective & Plan
- **Primary Goal:** Defeat Misty, get Cascade Badge.
- **Secondary Goal:** Travel to Mt. Moon.
- **Tertiary Goal:** Restock on essential items at the Pewter Mart.
- **Current Plan:** Heal at the Pokémon Center, restock at the Mart, then travel east through Route 3 to Mt. Moon.

## Key Learnings & Tactics
- **Objective Fixation is Dangerous:** Don't get so focused on one goal that you ignore critical needs (like healing).
- **Trust the Data:** The game state showed a reachable exit. I need to trust the data over my own flawed spatial reasoning.
- **Retreat is Smart:** Blacking out is inefficient. Retreating to a Pokémon Center to heal a weakened party is the correct strategic move.
- **Pathfinding is a critical weakness.** I get lost in simple maps and waste too much time in loops. I must trace a full, viable path and account for all obstacles *before* I start pressing buttons. 

## Agent Development: `npc_aware_pathfinder_agent`
- **Problem:** The agent consistently fails to generate valid paths.
- **Hypothesis:** The Python code generated by the agent's `run_code` tool has a bug in its obstacle detection logic. 
- **Next Steps (Updated):** I have updated the agent's system prompt to be much more explicit about what constitutes an obstacle (impassable tiles, ledges from the wrong direction, all NPCs except Pikachu, and defeated trainer markers). I need to test this new version in a controlled environment before relying on it.

## Assumptions to Test
- Do defeated trainers who block paths remain as obstacles permanently, or do they disappear after leaving and re-entering the map?
- Is the Jigglypuff in the Pewter Pokémon Center just for flavor, or does it have a unique interaction?

## Defeated Trainers Log
- **ROUTE 3:** Lass (17,10), Youngster (15,6), Youngster (20,6), Lass (21,5), Youngster (23,10), Youngster (25,7)
- **PEWTER GYM:** Jr. Trainer M (4,7), Gym Leader Brock (5,2)
- **VIRIDIAN FOREST:** All trainers defeated.
- **ROUTE 22:** Rival Pixel
- **OAK'S LAB:** Rival Pixel

## Critique & Improvement (Turn 4519)
- My navigation has been catastrophically inefficient. I must improve my fundamental pathfinding skills by planning routes carefully before moving.
- I must stop using the `npc_aware_pathfinder_agent` until it is fixed and tested. Relying on a broken tool is counterproductive.
- When a simple goal like 'reach the Pokémon Center' takes dozens of turns, I must recognize my approach has failed and re-evaluate the map calmly.

## Game Mechanics & Rules
- Defeated trainers on Route 3 are impassable obstacles. This is confirmed.
