# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- Start Turn: 49750 (Approx)
- Start Time: 3:20 PM (Approx)

## Strategy: Western Corridor Land Route (Row 44 Detour)
The northern plateau (Row 10-15) is blocked by a wall/ledge at Row 15, except at the far West (X=0-2). Internal city walls at X=5 and X=9 block direct access.
1. Land at (19, 30) (Completed).
2. Walk East to (12, 33) to bypass the X=9 wall.
3. Walk South to Row 44 (First gap in X=9 wall south of Row 33).
4. Walk West to (2, 44) to enter the Western Corridor.
5. Walk North through the corridor to Row 10.
6. Walk East along Row 10 to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.
