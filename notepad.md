# Post-Game: Kanto Adventure
- **Status:** Johto Champion.
- **Location:** S.S. Aqua.
- **Goal:** Find the Gentleman's Granddaughter.
- **Next Step:** Vermilion City.

# Quest Log: Missing Granddaughter
- **Client:** Gentleman (Lower Deck Far East).
- **Clue:** She is "bugging someone".
- **Search Progress:**
  - **1F East:**
    - Cabins at (19,8), (15,8): Empty.
    - Stairs (15,15) -> Lower Deck South (Dead End).
    - Stairs (19,15) -> Lower Deck Mid (Empty).
    - Stairs (23,15) -> Lower Deck East (Twins/Colin).
    - Stairs (27,15) -> Lower Deck Far East (Grandfather found).
    - Cabin (27,8): Empty (Checked Turn 20619).
  - **1F West:**
    - Blocked by Sailor at (21,17). Need to find "Lazy Buddy" to clear B1F path to access West side from below? Or maybe just find the buddy to move the 1F sailor?
    - **Current Plan:** Check remaining cabins on 1F East (23,8) then find the "Lazy Buddy".

# Side Quest: Lazy Sailor
- **Client:** Sailor at B1F (30,6).
- **Task:** Find his "lazy buddy" who is goofing off.
- **Suspect:** Sailor at 1F (22,17) / (20,17). (Tried interacting, generic text. Might need to check cabins).

# Exploration Notes
- **B1F:** East section accessible via ladder at 1F (30,14). Blocked by sailors at (30,6).
- **1F:** Central block forces movement to far East/West.

# Team Status
- **Muscle (Machoke)**: Lv70.
- **Others:** Garnet (29), Gyarados (35), Kunai (24), Zenith (15), Mistral (15).

# Pokedex
- Seen: 168, Owned: 30.
- **Log:** Entered Cabin from 1F (23, 8). Arrived at 15_4 (2, 13).
- **Observation:** Room contains Pokefan M. He is NOT the lazy sailor.
- **Plan:** Talk to Pokefan, then re-check "Empty" cabins at (19, 8) and (15, 8) in case I missed the sailor.
