# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Location:** Route 28 (West End).
- **Status:** Exploring West Wall.
- **Action:** Move West to (4, 6).
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Caught Rapidash ("Blitz").
  2. Continuing original plan to check the western edge of this area.
  3. Access to the House at (7, 3) requires being on the North side of the ledges at Row 5.
  4. Currently on the South side. Checking if the path wraps around at the far West.
  5. Map indicates x=3 is a Wall, so likely blocked, but need to visually confirm unseen tiles.
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Confirm this area is a dead end for reaching the House.
  2. Then exit to Silver Cave Outside via (0, 13).
  3. Re-strategize for reaching the House (Gatehouse interior?).
