# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Timestamp:** Turn 25784 (Jan 6, 2026)
- **Primary Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Immediate Task:** Explore Silver Cave Room 1 (Northern Section).
- **Sequence:**
    1. Backtrack South from (4, 16) to (12, 26).
    2. Navigate East to (14, 26) (crossing the x=13 divide).
    3. Navigate North from (14, 26) to explore the Eastern section (x>13).
    4. Keep an eye out for hidden items or new tunnel entrances.

# Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Acts as a South-facing Ledge (verified). Blocks North movement.
- **Navigation Notes:**
    - The gap at x=4 leads to a dead-end room (y=14-19).
    - The path to the North is likely on the East side (x>13), accessible via the crossing at y=26.
    - x=0 corridor is isolated by a wall at x=1. Must access from a different map entrance.
