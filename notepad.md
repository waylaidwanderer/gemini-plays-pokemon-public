# Blackthorn Gym Strategy
- Use Ice-type moves (Gyarados/Icy Wind, Sneasel, Swinub) against Dragons.
- Clear all trainers for XP.
- Navigate floor by floor.
- Current Target: Solve Boulder Puzzle (South-East).
- Defeated Cooltrainer F at (4, 11).
- Boulders located at (8, 14) and (6, 16).
- Strategy:
  - East Side Puzzle:
    - Target: Push Boulder 3 (8, 14) and Boulder 4 (6, 16) into Pit (8, 7).
    - Path for Boulder 3 (8, 14): Push North to (8, 12) -> West to (6, 12) -> North to (6, 7) -> East into Pit (8, 7).
    - Path for Boulder 4 (6, 16): Push North to (6, 7) -> East into Pit (8, 7).
    - Note: Verify if there is a second pit.
  - West Side Puzzle:
    - Target: Push Boulders into Pit (2, 5).
    - Access via Ladder (1, 7).
- Status: On 2F. Ready to solve South-East Boulder Puzzle.
- Plan:
  1. Go South to locate Boulders 3 and 4.
  2. Push Boulder 3 (East one) North-West towards Pit.
  3. Push Boulder 4 (West one) North towards Pit.
- Path to South: (7, 9) -> (6, 9) -> (6, 13).
- Boulder Locations (Expected): (8, 14) and (6, 17).
- Combat Note: Dragonair uses Dragon Rage (Fixed 40 DMG). Use High HP Pokemon (Muscle) to tank.
- Gym 2F Layout: Left (Col 0-1) and Right (Col 5-9) separated by wall, connected at Row 1 (Top) and Row 13 (Bottom). Also crossing at (2, 9) -> (3, 9).
- Alternative Solution: North Boulders (2, 3) and (3, 3).
- Boulder 1 (2, 3) can be pushed South into Pit (2, 5).
- Access via column 1 from Ladder (1, 7).
- Gym 1F Observation: Row 5 is a wall blocking access to Clair from the entrance/ladder area. Must solve 2F puzzle to proceed.
- Navigation Note: 1F is divided by walls at Row 5. To reach Clair (North), must fall from 2F.
- Cooltrainer M at (6, 6) is reachable from the South (Row 12+).
- Observed: Tiles (7, 6) and (7, 7) are labeled as Warps but do not trigger when walked on. They are likely Drop Zones from 2F.
- Defeated Cooltrainer M at (6, 6).
- Action: Ascend Ladder at (7, 9) to 2F.
- Strength Status: Active.
- Puzzle Logic:
  - Boulder 3 (8, 14) cannot be pushed North past Wall at (8, 9).
  - Boulder 3 cannot be pushed West from Col 8 due to Walls at (9, 11), (9, 12), (9, 13).
  - Therefore, B3 CANNOT reach the Pit. B3 is the SACRIFICE.
- Correct Strategy:
  1. Push Boulder 3 (8, 14) South to (8, 17) to open the path.
  2. Circle West to Boulder 4 (6, 16).
  3. Push Boulder 4 North to (6, 7).
  4. Push Boulder 4 East into Pit (8, 7).
- Action: Ascending to 2F to execute this plan.
- Strength Check: Map transition likely disabled Strength. Will verify and reactivate at (8, 13).
- Puzzle Status: Pushing Boulder 3 South to (8, 17) to clear path.
- Next Steps:
  1. Once B3 is at (8, 17), circle West to (6, 17).
  2. Push Boulder 4 (6, 16) North to (6, 7).
  3. Push B4 East into Pit (8, 7).
