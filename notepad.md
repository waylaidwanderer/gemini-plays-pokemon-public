  - **Clues:**
    - Rocket Grunt at Gym: "Oops! I so sorry! ... I make big mistake! ... Bye-bye a go-go!"
    - Confirmed: The Rocket Grunt is the thief.
    - Lead: He fled North. Chase him to Route 24 (Nugget Bridge).
  - **Plan:**
    1. Head North to Route 24 (Nugget Bridge).
    2. Find and defeat the Rocket Grunt.
    3. Recover the Machine Part.
- Detour: Investigating an unmarked house at (28, 17) before heading East to Route 9.
- Note: Access to (28, 17) requires looping around the block via (24, 18).
- Police Station Investigation: The Pokefan F mentioned they were held up by robbers. Possible connection to the Power Plant commotion? Need to speak to the Chief (Fishing Guru sprite) for details.
- Plan: Resume travel to Route 9 via the Northern entrance at (27, 12).
- Police Chief (Fishing Guru sprite) says: "I heard that some shady character is skulking about. I won't stand for it if he turns out to be a thief."
- Hypothesis: This might trigger the Rocket Grunt's appearance in the Cerulean Gym.
- Plan: Check Cerulean Gym (30, 23) for the Grunt. If not there, proceed to Route 9.
- Police Chief confirmed a "shady character" is skulking about. This is likely the Rocket Grunt.
- Heading to Cerulean Gym (30, 23) to intercept him.
- Searched Cerulean Gym back walkway. No Rocket Grunt found.
- Conclusion: The Police Chief's hint is not enough. Must trigger the event at the Power Plant first.
- Plan: Exit Gym, head to Route 9 (via 27, 12), and proceed to the Power Plant.
    - Officer at (6, 12): "I just got word from CERULEAN." (Confirming the lead).
