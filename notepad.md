# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Cross the whirlpool to reach the Dragon Shrine.

# Key Mechanics & Lessons
- **Field Moves:** If 'A' interaction fails (even when facing correctly), ALWAYS fallback to Menu -> Pokemon -> [Mon] -> [Move].
- **Whirlpool:** Requires facing the whirlpool tile directly. 'A' button might be unreliable; Menu is safer.

- Status: Correction - Closing Menu & Facing Down.
- Reason: Main Menu is currently OPEN (blocking movement). Game State shows 'Facing: Up'.
- Step 1: Press 'B' to close the menu.
- Step 2: Press 'Down' to face the whirlpool.
- Step 3: Verify 'Facing: Down' in next turn before interacting.
