# Blackthorn Gym (Puzzle Progress)
- Start Turn: 34763
- Pits: P1 (8, 3), P2 (2, 5), P3 (8, 7).
- Boulders (Reset): B6 (3, 3), B7 (6, 1), B8 (8, 11).
- Status: Strength ACTIVE.

# Puzzle Analysis (2F)
- B8 Status: Confirmed trapped in Column 8 (Rows 10-17) by walls at (8, 8), (8, 9), (9, 12-17), and (7, 10, 11, 14, 15).
- Strategic Pivot: B8 is likely a decoy. I must find the real third boulder.
- Hypothesis: There is a boulder in the far-left corridors (Cols 0-1) or far-right corners.
- Plan: 
  1. Explore Column 0-1 from Row 13 to Row 17.
  2. Explore Column 9 from Row 1 to Row 11.
  3. Solve B6 and B7 once the layout is clear.

# Tile Mechanics (2F)
- WALL: (4, 0, 2-10, 12), (2, 8-17), (7, 10, 11, 14, 15), (8, 8, 9), (9, 12-17).
- GAP: (4, 1) and (4, 13-17) are passable.
- Pushing: Player moves into boulder's old tile. (Verified Turn 34814).
