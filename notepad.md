# Pokémon Crystal Journey

## Current Situation
- **Objective:** Report the theft of a Pokémon to Professor Elm.
- **Status:** I am currently in Professor Elm's Lab, but I seem to be stuck and unable to leave. My current hypothesis is that I need to use the POKEGEAR to call Professor Elm to trigger a story event.

## Long-term Goal
- Become the Pokémon League Champion.

## The Rival
- A red-haired boy named ??? stole a Totodile from Professor Elm's lab.
- I was defeated by him in Cherrygrove City.

## Key Items
- **POKéGEAR:** Received from Mom. Has a Phone feature.
- **POKéDEX:** Received from Professor Oak. Automatically records data on Pokémon.
- **MYSTERY EGG:** Received from Mr. Pokémon. Needs to be taken to Professor Elm.

## Mechanics & Discoveries
### System Mechanics
- **Warp Mechanics:** Some warp tiles may require stepping off of them and then back on to activate.
- **SELECT Button:** Can be used to register a key item for quick use.
### Environmental Mechanics
- **Route 29 Ledges:** The western section of Route 29 has one-way ledges preventing eastward travel from that area.
- **Route 46:** This route is a dead-end when approached from the south due to one-way ledges.
- **CUT_TREE:** These small trees are impassable and require the HM 'Cut' to be removed.
### Battle Mechanics
- **Held Items (Berries):** Some Pokémon can hold items like Berries, which they can use automatically in battle to heal themselves when their HP gets low.
- **Smokescreen:** Lowers the opponent's accuracy.
### Item Effects
- **POTION:** Heals a Pokémon for 20 HP.

## Wild Pokémon Encounters
### Route 29 (Tall Grass)
- **Hoppip** (Lv. 2-3): Knows Splash
- **Sentret** (Lv. 2-3): Knows Tackle
- **Pidgey** (Lv. 2-3): Knows Tackle
- **Rattata** (Lv. 2): Knows Tackle
- **Hoothoot** (Lv. 3): Knows Tackle

## Important NPCs
- **Professor Elm** (New Bark Town): Gave me Hestia and his phone number. A Pokémon was stolen from his lab.
- **Mom** (New Bark Town): Gave me the POKéGEAR.
- **MR. POKEMON** (Route 30): Gave me the MYSTERY EGG.
- **Professor Oak** (met at Mr. Pokémon's House): Gave me the POKéDEX.

## Puzzle Solutions
- **Stuck on Warp/Event Tile:** If stuck on a warp or after an event, opening the main menu ('Start') and then closing it ('B') can resolve the issue. This has worked in multiple locations (Mr. Pokémon's House, Cherrygrove City) but failed in Elm's Lab.

## Self-Corrections & Failed Hypotheses
- The exit from Cherrygrove City to Route 29 is on the east side of the city at (39, 7), not the west.
