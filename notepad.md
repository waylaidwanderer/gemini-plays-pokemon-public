# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard ground. Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Surf required. Traversable.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- DOOR: Warp point.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable cliff face. Blocks movement from either side (e.g., at 6, 34 blocks South).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
- BREAKABLE ROCK: Requires Rock Smash. Impassable.
- NPC: Impassable. Interact from adjacent tile.

# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Approach: Buoy Maze Navigation (Exploration Phase)
- Plan:
  1. Surf at (12, 27) and clear message. [IN PROGRESS]
  2. Use pathfinding tool to identify the sequence of gaps (X=16, 19, 22, 26).
  3. Navigate to the northern plateau landing spot.
- Status: Clearing Surf message at (12, 28).
- Reasoning: The buoy maze is the intended path. Previous land-based routes were blocked by ledges and walls. I will use my updated pathfinder (Turn 48663) to find the correct water route.
