# Kanto Campaign Status
- **Location:** Cerulean Pokemon Center.
- **Current Objective:** Reach the Power Plant via Route 9.
- **Immediate Task:** Escape Pokedex (B x4), Face Right, Open Menu (Start), Select Pokemon (Down, A), Select Belladonna (Down x5), Cut (A, A).
- **Observation:** I am deep in the Pokedex (Feraligatr entry). Must back out fully.
- **Position:** Confirmed at (32, 24) facing Up. Tree is to the Right.
- **Strategy:** Using Menu-based Cut because context-sensitive 'A' has failed repeatedly. 5 Downs ensures reaching the bottom slot (Belladonna).

1. **Restore Power:**
   - Investigate Power Plant (East of Cerulean, end of Route 9).
   - Fix the Generator (likely requires a part).
2. **Wake Snorlax:**
