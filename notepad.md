# Current Strategy: Explore Silver Cave Item Rooms
- **Location:** Silver Cave Item Rooms (3_77)
- **Status:** At (6, 3) in the Northern Entry Area.
- **Goal:** Access the Southern Area (Rows 5+) to find items.
- **Hypothesis:** The tile at (6, 4) is a ledge that can be jumped DOWN. Historical data supports this. The "Blocked Ledge" markers may be incorrect or refer to attempting to climb UP.

  - **Layout:** Northern "Entry Box" (Rows 1-3) separated from Southern Area by Ledges (Row 4).
  - **Warps:** (13, 3) leads back to Silver Cave Room 2 (13, 21).
  - **Connection:** Need to jump ledges to proceed.
- **Silver Cave Room 2 (3_75):**
  - **Waterfall:** Located at (11, 29).
  - **Warps:** (13, 21) <-> Item Rooms. (17, 31) <-> Room 1.
