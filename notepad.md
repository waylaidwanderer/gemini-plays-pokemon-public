# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Deliver Kenya to Route 31.
- **Secondary Goal:** Travel to Mahogany Town (Route 42).
- **Tertiary Goal:** Train Party to Level 30+.
- **Current Action:** Verify Kenya's Mail Content (Crucial Step).
  1. **Situation:** Need to confirm EXACT text before deciding to rewrite.
  2. **Plan:**
     - Open Kenya's Menu -> MAIL -> READ.
     - **Observe Screen Text:** Confirm if it says "DARK CAVE leads to another road".
     - **Decision:**
       - If YES: Do NOT rewrite. Problem is delivery target. Move Kenya to Slot 1 and retry delivery.
       - If NO: Take mail, give fresh mail, write correct message.
  3. **Immediate Step:** Open Menu (`A`), navigate to MAIL (`Down` x3).

## Strategy & Lessons
- **Quest Item Logic:** Do not alter quest items (e.g., mail messages) unless necessary. Original attributes often matter.
- **Fly Map:** List-based `Up`/`Down`. Order: New Bark -> Cherrygrove -> Violet -> Azalea -> Goldenrod.
- **Menu Cursor:** Always verify position.
- **Negative Results:** Mark NPCs with "Generic Text" or "Wrong Recipient" to avoid re-checking.
