# Suicune Quest Log (Crystal Version)
- Prerequisites: Clear Bell (Obtained).
- Quest Start: Turn 24182 (Timestamp: Saturday, Dec 27, 2025, 9:35 AM PST).
- Loop Start: Turn 26164 (Stuck on sightings).

## Current Strategy
- Plan:
  1. Fly to Ecruteak City.
  2. Head South to Route 36 junction.
  3. Walk onto (35, 9) on Route 36 to trigger the Suicune sighting.
  4. If that fails, check the Burned Tower basement for Eusine.
  5. If progress stalls, attempt to enter Tin Tower and climb.

## Lessons Learned
- Suicune events are strictly linear.

- Verification is key: Marker at (11, 20) in Cianwood confirms Eusine's defeat.
