# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Current Task
- **Map 4_6**: Ecruteak Mart.
- **Action**: Buying Super Potions (x3).
- **Status**: Revive purchased. Remaining Funds: ¥2110.
- **Next**: Manual heal Topaz/Garnet. Then Kimono Girls.

- **Map 3_13**: Tile (15, 4) is a BREAKABLE ROCK (impassable), despite being TYPE_3fe2. BFS will fail here. Go around via the Left side (Col 4).
- **Map 3_13**: Item at (14, 2) is blocked by Breakable Rock at (15, 4). Requires Rock Smash.
- **Exploration**: Checking bottom-right area (Cols 14-16) before leaving.
- **Reflection (Turn 14727)**:
  - **Progress**: Defeated Morty (Fog Badge)! Swapped Amethyst for Headache (Psyduck) to use Surf.
  - **Challenge**: Nurse Joy interaction loop/bug. Abandoned Center to buy supplies at Mart instead.
  - **Goal**: Buy Revives/Potions. Heal manually. Defeat Kimono Girls for Surf.
  - **Lesson**: If an interaction fails repeatedly, change the environment (leave/re-enter) or strategy (manual healing) immediately. Don't mash.
### Strategy Log
- **Ecruteak Gym**:
  - **Mechanics**: Ghosts here are Poison/Ghost.
  - **Weaknesses**: Ground (Dig/Mud-Slap), Psychic.
  - **Immunities**: Normal types (Amethyst/Bolin) are immune to Ghost moves.
  - **Lesson**: Mud-Slap hits Gastly (No Levitate in Gen 2).
  - **Plan**: Teach TM28 (Dig) to Garnet for high-power Ground coverage.
- **Immediate Task**: Heal -> Teach Dig -> Buy Potions -> Re-enter Gym.
### Mechanics
- **Ecruteak Gym**: Falling into a pitfall warps to the entrance. Intentionally stepping on one is faster than walking back.
- **Shopping Plan**:
  - Budget: ¥3610.
  - Target: Revive (x1) @ ¥1500, Super Potion (x3) @ ¥700. Total: ¥3600.
  - Backup: Super Potion (x5) @ ¥3500.
  - Current Action: Cancel Poké Ball selection and scroll down to find Revive.
