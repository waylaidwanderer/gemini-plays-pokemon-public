# Current Status
- **Status:** On Route 25 (Maze Area).
- **Location:** (15, 9).
- **Goal:** Find Misty at the Cape (East of Bill's House).
- **Action:** Navigating via (23, 9) -> (23, 11) -> (26, 11) -> (26, 9) -> (25, 7) to bypass walls/ledges.
- **Path Plan:**
  1. (15, 9) East to (23, 9) (Pass x=22 on Row 9).
  2. South to (23, 11).
  3. East to (26, 11).
  4. North to (26, 9).

# Quest Logic (Cascade Badge)
1. **Fact:** I have TM07 => Power Plant fixed.
2. **Fact:** Misty is NOT in the Gym.
3. **Fact:** Misty was NOT at the Cape Pier.
4. **Current Task:** Search Route 25 High Ground.
5. **Gramps:** Asking for Lickitung (Everstone). I need to show Lickitung before I can show Oddish for Leaf Stone.
6. **Plan:**
    - Exit Bill's House.
    - Check for "High Ground" entrance West of House (Cut tree?).
    - Or re-check the North-East corner (maybe hidden path?).
    - If all else fails, re-check Gym (maybe entering house triggered reset).
