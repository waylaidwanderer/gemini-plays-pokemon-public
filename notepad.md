<h1><code>Mechanics/Combat</code></h1>

[Turn 62] Combat basics: Turn-based. Type matchups are critical (e.g. Water beats Fire, Grass beats Water). STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) applies for matching move and Pokémon types. Use FIGHT to attack, ITEM to use Potions.
- **Hydro (Squirtle)**: Learned Bubble (Water) at Level 8.
[Status Effects]
- Overworld Poison: Pokemon lose 1 HP every 4 steps in the overworld. Calculate exact step limit (Current HP * 4) to know exactly how far you can travel before panicking!

<h1><code>Mechanics/Battle_Gen1</code></h1>

- "But, it failed!" refers to the move just executed by the current Pokemon (e.g., an enemy's stat-dropping move failing because the stat can't go lower, or Gen 1 AI quirks). It does NOT mean the player's previous attack missed.
