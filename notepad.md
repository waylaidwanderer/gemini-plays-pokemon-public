## Core Principles & Lessons Learned
- **IMMEDIATE ACTION:** I must perform tasks like placing markers, updating my notepad, and fixing tools *immediately*. Deferring tasks, like placing map markers, is a process violation. Significant events must be documented *immediately* in the turn they occur.
- **AGENT USAGE:** When stuck for more than 5 turns on a puzzle, I must use the `hypothesis_generator` agent. My `simple_battle_strategist` agent is underutilized and I will prioritize using it for all future wild battles to automate decision-making.
- **PUZZLE DOCUMENTATION:** My entire problem-solving process (observation, hypothesis, test, conclusion) for any puzzle must be documented in this notepad as it happens.
- **MAP MARKER DISCIPLINE:** I must always check for existing map markers before creating a new one to avoid duplicates.
- **TOOL MAINTENANCE:** I must NEVER defer fixing a broken tool or agent. It is always the highest priority, overriding any in-game objective.

## General Discoveries
- My biggest obstacle is my own memory. I must only trust in-game observation.
- Stunning an NPC can break scripted events, causing dialogue loops.
- The 'Poké Ball machine' was a hallucination.
- The southern path on Route 29 is a dead end.
- The western path on Route 29 is blocked by CUT_TREEs and HEADBUTT_TREEs.
- Talking to Mom does NOT heal my Pokémon. This is a critical mechanic difference from other games.
- Resting in the player's bed does NOT heal Pokémon.
- Repeatedly interacting with an object (like a sign) without new results can lead to loops. I must dismiss dialogue before attempting to move.
- The 'Select' button on the nicknaming screen toggles between uppercase and lowercase keyboards.

## Area and Navigation Insights

### Tile Traversal and Movement Rules
- **BOOKSHELF**: Impassable. (Verified)
- **COUNTER**: Impassable. (Verified by observation)
- **CUT_TREE**: Impassable, requires a specific ability/item to remove. (Verified)
- **DOOR**: Traversable, acts as a warp tile. (Verified)
- **FLOOR**: Traversable. (Verified)
- **HEADBUTT_TREE**: Impassable. (Verified by observation)
- **LADDER**: Traversable, acts as a warp tile. (Verified)
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT**: One-way traversal.

## Puzzles, Hypotheses & Assumptions

### Solved: Sprout Tower 2F Pillar Puzzle
- **Observation:** A central pillar on 2F blocked access between the eastern and central sections.
- **Hypothesis (from Sage dialogue):** The Sage's dialogue about the 'flexible pillar' was a trigger that has now made the pillar passable.
- **Test:** Used `find_path_to_target` to plot a course through the pillar's location after speaking to the Sage.
- **Conclusion:** The pathfinder successfully found a route, confirming the hypothesis. Speaking to the Sage at (12, 3) makes the pillar at x=11 passable.

### Past Investigations & Solved Puzzles
- **Fisher NPC Interaction Failure (New Bark Town):**
  - **Conclusion:** Moving NPCs can disrupt interactions. Stunning them first is a reliable solution.
- **Healing Methods (New Bark Town):**
  - **Conclusion:** Neither Mom nor the player's bed heals Pokémon in this game.
- **Nickname Screen Controls:**
  - **Conclusion:** The 'Select' button toggles the keyboard case.
- **Building Identification (Violet City):**
  - **Assumption:** Building at (21, 29) was the Gym. **(Confirmed to be a house with a trade NPC)**
- **Sprout Tower vs. Gym:**
  - **Assumption:** Sprout Tower is separate from the Gym. **(Confirmed)**
- **MR. POKEMON's House Location:**
  - **Assumption:** Located on Route 30. **(Confirmed)**

## Corrected Misunderstandings
- The 'Poké Ball machine' in Elm's lab was a hallucination.
- Hallucinated a warp at (9, 35) on Route 30. There is no warp there.
- Hallucinated a warp at (13, 9) on Route 30. The actual house entrance is at (17, 5).
- **CRITICAL HALLUCINATION (Turn 2667):** Believed I was on Sprout Tower 2F at (17, 3) when I was actually on Sprout Tower 1F at (17, 2). All plans based on being on 2F were invalid. Corrected my position and plan based on the actual game state.
- **Pathfinder Tool Issue:** The pathfinder was flagged as faulty. I have since fixed it by adding dynamic debug prints to better diagnose future issues.

## NPCs and Interactions
- An Officer in the Route 31 Gatehouse mentioned visiting SPROUT TOWER.
- An NPC in a house on Route 30 mentioned that Berries can be found by checking trees.

## Item Effects
- **PRZCUREBERRY**: Cures paralysis. (Hypothesis based on name)

## Sprout Tower 1F Investigation
- **CONCLUSION:** Confirmed trapped in central 1F section. The path forward must be on a different floor.

## Sprout Tower 2F Investigation
- **CONCLUSION:** The western section of 2F is inaccessible from the central or eastern sections on this floor.
- **Hypotheses (from Agent):**
  1. A staircase or ladder on 1F leads up to the western section of 2F. **(Tested & Failed: The western ladder on 1F at (2, 6) is unreachable from the central section.)**
  2. The wall at x=4 contains a hidden or secret passage.
  3. A path to the western section of 2F is accessed by first ascending to 3F and then taking a different ladder down.
