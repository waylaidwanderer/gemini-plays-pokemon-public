# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement. Passable from SOUTH to NORTH. Found at (6-8, 34), (10, 48), (12, 50), (16, 10).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. One-way ledge jumping South. Found at (10, 15).
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- Start Turn: 49771
- Start Time: 3:29 PM

## Strategy: The Outer Sea Loop (Final)
The northern plateau (Row 10-12) is only accessible via the Western Corridor (X=0-2). The corridor is only accessible from the southern clearway (Row 51).
1. Walk to the Eastern Beach at (23, 32). (In Progress)
2. Surf South along column X=24 to Row 51.
3. Land at (24, 51).
4. Walk West along Row 51 to (2, 51) to enter the Western Corridor.
5. Walk North through the corridor to Row 14.
6. Walk East to (8, 14), then North to Row 10.
7. Walk East to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune sighting.

# Progress Notes
- Verified: Land routes to Row 51 are blocked by South-facing ledges (FLOOR_UP_WALL).
- Verified: The Western Corridor (X=0-2) is the only path to the plateau.
- Note: Out of Repels. No wild encounters on land in the city.
- Hypothesis: (14, 10) is the trigger point for the Suicune sighting.

# Reflection Turn (49817)
- Immediate Execution: Reverting to the Sea Loop strategy. Land-based bypasses (Row 34, etc.) are blocked by the city's complex wall/ledge layout.
- Notepad Hygiene: Removed failed Row 34 bypass strategy.
- Automation: Proceeding with manual navigation due to system environment issues.
