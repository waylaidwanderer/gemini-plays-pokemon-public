# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Current Task
- **Status**: In Bag (Heal Mode). Trapped in Center.
- **Immediate**: Heal Garnet (27/90) with Super Potion.
- **Plan**: Locate Super Potion -> Heal -> Talk to Sprite at (10, 4).
- **Reasoning**: Need health before triggering events.
- **Party**: Garnet (27/90) [Critical].
- **Goal**: Escape via B1F.

### Party Status
- Garnet (32) [Critical], Basil (9), Amethyst (10) [Fainted], Spinarak (14), Topaz (15) [Fainted], Harrz (14) [Fainted].

### Reflection & Plan
- **Reflection**: I've been hallucinating exits. `find_reachable_exits` confirmed I am trapped. I must rely on game mechanics (triggers/holes) rather than hoping for walls to disappear.
- **Eusine**: He ran away to the SE. Following his path might reveal the way.
- **Plan**: Move South to (10, 10). Search adjacent tiles.
- **Route**: (10, 5) -> South to (10, 10).
