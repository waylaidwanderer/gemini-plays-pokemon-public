  1. Navigate to (13, 17) (Row 17 Gap).
  2. Navigate to (9, 21) (Row 21 Gap).
  3. Navigate to (13, 23) (Row 23 Gap).
  4. Navigate to (18, 28) (Row 28 Gap).
  5. Navigate to (17, 32) (Row 32 Gap).
  6. Navigate to (20, 34) (Row 34 Gap).

# Lessons Learned
- Blackthorn Maze: The city is not isolated; walking gaps exist in every ledge/wall row.
- Menu Verification: Always check the current screen before executing long button sequences.
- Eastern Strip (Col 39) access: From Ice Path exit (36, 9), move Up to (36, 8), then Right to (39, 8). This column appears to be a clear vertical corridor bypassing all ledges and walls, leading directly to the eastern tall grass of Route 45.
## Training & Exploration Log (Turn #33584)
- Started training Kimchi and Xenon on Route 45.
- Turn #33983: Exploring Blackthorn City's tiered layout.
- Turn #33999: Confirmed Col 34-37 is a trapped middle section. Must use Col 39 for full southern access.
- Observation: Hopping ledges in Blackthorn (e.g., Row 15, Row 21) moves the player two tiles south and is one-way.
- Hypothesis: Eastern strip (Col 39) is the intended path to Route 45 East.
- Eastern Strip Access: Column 38 is a wall from Row 9 to Row 19. Access to Column 39 is ONLY possible at Row 8 (near Ice Path exit).
## Specific Gaps in Blackthorn Maze
- Row 15 Gap: (35, 15)
- Row 11 Gaps: (35, 11), (32, 11)
- Row 9 Gap: (32, 9)
- Route to Eastern Strip: (37, 16) -> (35, 16) -> (35, 14) -> (32, 14) -> (32, 8) -> (39, 8) -> Down.
