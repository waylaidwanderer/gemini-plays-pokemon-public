# Tile Mechanics
- **TALL_GRASS:** traversable, chance of wild encounter.
- **HEADBUTT_TREE:** solid (collision), chance of encounter if Headbutt is used.
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN:** one-way traversable (down only).
- **WALL:** impassable.
- **FLOOR:** traversable.

# Lessons Learned
- **Automation Limits:** Long macro tools crossing map boundaries are unreliable due to variable load times and interruptions (phone calls, repels). Use short, verifiable sequences instead.

# Strategic Status
- **Money:** ¥2294 (Enough for ~4 Super Repels).
- **Shopping List:** Super Repel x4.
- **Task Start:** Turn 39121 (Dept Store Supply Run).
- **Goal:** Register Raikou & Entei.
- **Strategy:** Blind Hunt (Optimized). 
    - **Logic:** Tracking roamers from adjacent maps is futile because entering their map causes them to move. Thus, a blind encounter on entry is the only valid method.
    - Use Super Repel with Lead Pokemon (Lv 36) < Roamer (Lv 40) but > Wild (Lv 17).
    - Loop: Enter Route 37 -> Scan Grass (20 steps) -> Exit to Ecruteak -> Repeat.
    - Do NOT check Pokegear map.
- **Repel Status:** Wore off (Turn 39058). Out of stock. Ecruteak Mart had none.
- **Session Start:** Turn 38471.
- **Active Events:** Bug-Catching Contest (Tuesday).
- **Roamer Logic:** Roamers move to an adjacent map when the player transitions maps. 'Blind Interception' relies on them moving *into* your map as you enter.
- **Detour to Goldenrod:** Started Turn 39093. Arrived.
- **Reflection (Turn 39145):**
    - Search for Super Repels ongoing.
    - 2F confirmed empty of Super Repels.
    - Checking 3F Directory.
