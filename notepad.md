# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Challenge the Pokémon League.
- **Secondary:** Get Master Ball (New Bark Town).
- **Tertiary:** Train team for Victory Road.
- **Immediate:** Fly to New Bark Town.

# Current Status (Turn 18545)
- **Location:** New Bark Town (13, 6).
- **Activity:** Going to Elm's Lab.
- **Goal:** Get Master Ball from Elm.
- **Context:** Gyarados learned Surf (replaced Icy Wind).

# Plan
1. Go to Elm's Lab (6, 3).
2. Get Master Ball from Elm.
3. Surf East to Route 27 (Tohjo Falls).

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Obstacle. Requires HM06 + Badge.
- **Buoy:** Obstacle.
- **Lava/Magma:** (None here).
- **Ice:** Sliding mechanics (Mahogany Gym/Ice Path).
- **Warp Carpets:** Directional exits.
- **Ledges/Walls:** `FLOOR_UP_WALL` tiles (e.g., Blackthorn 21,16) are impassable from the North (obstacle).

# Lessons
- **Menu Navigation:** Always verify cursor position.
- **Map Reading:** Verify tile types.
- **Warps:** If a warp doesn't trigger, try different approach angles.
- **Item Management:** If PC shortcuts (like 'Move w/o Mail') fail or are confusing, manually removing items via the Party menu is more reliable.
- **Gen 2 Mechanics:** Move type determines category. Water is Special, so Gyarados's Surf and Waterfall are Special attacks, not Physical. Ghost is Physical. Dark is Special.
