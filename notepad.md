# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Reach the Dragon Shrine via the East Whirlpool.

# Current Status (Turn 18303)
- **Location:** Dragon's Den B1F (24, 22).
- **Facing:** Down (Verified).
- **Action:** Bump and Interact with Whirlpool at (24, 23).
- **Reasoning:** 'A' alone didn't trigger text. Bumping (`Down`) into the tile before pressing 'A' often forces interaction.
- **Sequence:**
  1. `Down` (Bump).
  2. `A` (Interact).
  3. `A` (Advance Text).
  4. `A` (Confirm "Yes").

# Plan
1. Clear Whirlpool at (24, 23).
2. Move South to (24, 24).
3. Surf West/South to Dragon Shrine Entrance (19, 29).

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Requires HM06 Whirlpool + Glacier Badge. 
- **Lava/Magma:** (None here).
- **Ice:** (None here).

# Lessons
- **Menu Navigation:** Always verify cursor position before committing to a sequence. Blind input leads to wrong menus (e.g., PACK instead of POKEMON).
