# Blackthorn Gym (Puzzle Progress)
- Start Turn: 34763
- Pits (2F): P1 (8, 3), P2 (2, 5), P3 (8, 7).
- Boulders (2F): B6 (3, 3), B7 (6, 1), B8 (8, 12).
- Status: Strength is ACTIVE.

# Tile Mechanics (2F)
- WALL: Impassable. (4, 0-10, 12), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8).
- Gap: (4, 13) is the primary connection between left and right.
- Right Side Entry: Row 13 (4,13) or Row 1 (Cody 4,1).
- B8 (8, 12) is in a pocket (8, 10-15).

# Puzzle Analysis (2F)
- Hypothesis: B8 can reach P3 (8, 7) or P1 (8, 3) by moving through Column 9.
- Hypothesis: B6 (3, 3) can reach P2 (2, 5) by moving through Column 0/1.
- Obstacle: Need to verify if (8, 8) and (8, 9) are actually walls.

# Strategy: Blackthorn Gym 2F
- Step 1: Move to (7, 8) to inspect Column 8 walls.
- Step 2: Push B8 into a pit.
- Step 3: Push B6 into a pit.
- Step 4: Push B7 into a pit.

# Failed Hypotheses
- H1: Cody is passable. (Failed, Turn 34770)
- H2: B6 can reach P2 from the left side. (Failed, Turn 34775 - Col 4 blocks)
- H3: Player moves into tile after push. (Failed, Turn 34782)
