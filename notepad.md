# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- **Quest Start:** Turn 48900
- **Status:** Testing (11, 15) gap. Turn count: ~530 since quest start.

## Execution Plan (Gap Verification)
1. Walk to (11, 15) and move North to (11, 14). <- CURRENT TASK
2. If (11, 14) allows East/West/North movement to (14, 10), proceed.
3. If (11, 14) is a dead end pocket, return to city and use Western Corridor (X=2).

## Strategy: Southern Bypass
The city center is blocked by one-way ledges (Row 34, 46, 48, 50) and walls. To reach the western corridor (X=2), I must Surf around the south end of the map (Row 51). This avoids all city barriers.

## Failed Hypotheses & Lessons
- Island Hop (13, 16): Dead end due to walls at Row 13/15.
- Inner Channel (X=12): Blocked at Row 15 by buoy wall.
- Terrestrial Path (South): Blocked by multiple ledge lines.
- Terrestrial Path (West): Blocked by wall lines at X=11, 9, 5, 3.

## Progress Summary
- All 16 Badges obtained.
- Elite Four/Red defeated.
- Current Focus: Suicune tracking.
