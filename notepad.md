    3. Collect item at (7, 18).
    4. Explore SilverCaveRoom1 to find the ladder to the next floor.
    5. Face Red at the peak.

# Progress Tracking

- Mt. Silver Access: Unlocked.
- Inventory Management: Protein used on ICARUS at Turn 43371. 1 slot free.
- Navigation Analysis: find_path_v6_robust failed at Turn 43371 because it ignored FLOOR_UP_WALL mechanics in Row 28. Defined find_path_v7_robust to fix this.
- Task Started: Turn 43296. Goal: Collect item at (7, 18).
