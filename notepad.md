# Completed Notes (Archive)
- **Dept Store Puzzle:** Solved. Blue Barrier blocks path.
- **Rival Battle:** Defeated Silver.
- **Blockage:** Path South blocked by solid wall at Row 10 (x=11-21).
- **Hypothesis:** Switch 1 opened Row 7, but Row 10 remains closed. Need to find another switch or mechanism.
- **Plan:**
  1. Pick up item (Might be key?).
  2. Inspect "Emergency Switch" location at (20, 11) via (20, 10).
  3. Explore corners of North Room (Row 5) for missed switches.
- **Puzzle Mechanic:** "Open one shutter, another closes." Switch 1 ON opens South path (Row 7) but seems to close West path (Row 5/Col 10).
- **Hypothesis:** Turning Switch 1 OFF might open the Top Path (Row 3) or the West Shutter, allowing access to the NW area.
- **Current Block:** Tile (10, 5) is impassable.
- **Next Step:** Battle Grunt at (11, 4). Then try turning Switch 1 OFF to access the West side via Row 3.
- **Clue:** Grunt at (11, 4) said 'The switch on the end is the one to press first'.
- **Plan Update:** Grunt didn't move. Assuming static. Returning to Switch 1 to turn it OFF. Expectation: West Shutter (10, 5) will OPEN.
