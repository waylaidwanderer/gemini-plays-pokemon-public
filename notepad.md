*Started Turn 2803*

## Goal: Catch the bird to obtain HM01 (Cut).

## Puzzle Mechanics
- **Apprentice Hint**: "You have to get behind it to catch it."
- **Startle Logic**: Interacting from the front or side makes the bird fly ~6 tiles away from the player.
- **Twig Logic**: Tiles with dark specs are noisy. Stepping on them near the bird makes it turn to face the sound.
- **Success Condition**: Interact from the tile directly behind the bird's facing direction.
