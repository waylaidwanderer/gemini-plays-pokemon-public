- **Goal**: Reach Route 35 Gatehouse (North).
- **Current Action**: Moving South to Row 29 (Main Cross-Street), then East.
- **Reasoning**: Row 21 appears to be blocked by a large building (Department Store?). I need to find the main road North, which might be further East (around x=10-15).
- **Path**: South to Row 29, then East.
