- **Major Target:** CATCH LUGIA.
- **Start Time:** Jan 7, 2026 (Turn 27211).
- **Whirl Islands Start:** Jan 7, 2026 (Turn 27574).

## Whirl Islands Strategy
- **Target:** Lugia (Lv 60).
- **Location:** NE Island (Route 41) -> B1F -> B2F -> B3F (Waterfall Basin).
- **Requirements:** Flash (Belladonna), Surf (Qaagmaqnjw), Whirlpool (Lapis), Silver Wing (Owned).
- **Navigation:** Exploring Western Channel (X=0-3) to bypass buoy barriers.
- **Catch Plan:**
  - **Risk:** Team is underleveled for Lv 60 Legendary. Lapis (Hypnosis) is Lv 12 and will die instantly.

  - **Strategy:** Exploration first. Locate Lugia. Attempt catch with current balls. If failing/wiping, consider Master Ball or tactical retreat to train/buy balls.
  - **Note:** Roaming Raikou/Entei are better targets for Master Ball, so try to save it. Use Repels.

2. **Notepad:** Cleaned up old reflections to maintain hygiene.
3. **Map:** Good marker coverage.
4. **Strategy:** The hypothesis that the NE Island cave must be approached from the South (via the West Channel loop) is currently being tested. I am navigating the West Channel (Column 17) to bypass buoy barriers.
