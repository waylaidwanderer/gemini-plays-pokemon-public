### Strategic Reflection (Turn 8719)
- **Status**: Stuck in Goldenrod for ~100 turns.
- **Issue**: Oscillating between East/West without clearing the "fog of war".
- **Insight**: The North-East (Flower Shop) is a cul-de-sac. The Central North Wall seems solid. The only remaining option is the North-West quadrant, which is largely "unseen".
- **Action Plan**: 
    1. Return to Main Street (y=10).
    2. Move West to x=6.
    3.Systematically explore North from there, hugging the West edge.

### Navigation Notes
- **Location**: Goldenrod City North.
- **Goal**: Reach Route 35.
- **Status**: Exiting the Name Rater's House (Map 11_10).
- **Correction**: The building at (15, 7) is the Name Rater's House, NOT the Gatehouse.
- **Plan**:
    1. Exit to Goldenrod City.
    2. Check columns x=16, 17, 18 for the path North.
    3. The Gatehouse must be further North or to the side of this building.

### Map Structure
- **Name Rater**: (15, 7).
- **Gym**: (24, 7).
- **Route 35 Exit**: Unknown, likely North of y=7.

### Quest Chain: SquirtBottle
1. **Defeat Whitney**: Done.
2. **Find Floria**: Check Route 36 (North of Route 35).
3. **Get Bottle**: Return to Flower Shop.
