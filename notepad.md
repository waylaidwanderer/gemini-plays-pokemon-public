## Tracking Progress and Corrections
### Current Plan
- **Objective:** Reach Cherrygrove City.
- **Strategy:**
    1. The main upper path is blocked by trees that I cannot walk through.
    2. My pathfinding tool was flawed and needs to be corrected.
    3. New plan: After correcting my tool, I will use it to find and explore any remaining unseen areas on this route to find an alternative path west.

### Misunderstandings & Corrections
- Corrected my assumption that tree tiles are walkable. They are obstacles.
