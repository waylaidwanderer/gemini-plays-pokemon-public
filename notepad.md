# Gem's Strategic Playbook

## Core Principles (Hard Mode)
- **Tactical Switching is Key:** If a Pokémon's stats are severely debuffed (e.g., Attack/Defense fell multiple times), switch it out. A fainted Pokémon gets no EXP. Don't persist in a losing fight. (Lesson from FURYFIST vs. Nidoran♀).
- **Efficient EXP Management:** Funnel EXP to Pokémon that need it. Avoid using Pokémon near the level cap for finishing blows on weak opponents. (Lesson from SPARKY vs. Nidoran♀).
- **Plan Locally, Act Globally:** Before making long-distance travel plans, always analyze the immediate area for resources (training spots, items, etc.). Don't assume a far-off location is better without checking nearby options first. (Lesson from Route 2 vs. Route 22).
- **Proactive Agent Use:** Use agents for planning and strategy *before* acting, not just as a reactive measure when stuck. `progression_advisor_agent` and `optimal_training_spot_agent` are key planning tools.
