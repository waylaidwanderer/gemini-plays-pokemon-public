# Suicune Hunt Strategy (Crystal)
- Status: ROAMING. Suicune moves every time the player flies or crosses a map boundary.
- Lead: XENON (Gastly Lv21). Moves: Mean Look (prevents fleeing), Hypnosis (induces sleep).
- Strategy: Boundary cycling between Route 38 and Ecruteak City. Move between maps and check the Pokedex 'Area' snapshot.
- Goal: Obtain the Quick Claw to ensure XENON can move first and land Mean Look or Hypnosis.

# Suicune Battle Plan
- Turn 1: MEAN LOOK. Mandatory to prevent Suicune from fleeing.
- Turn 2+: HYPNOSIS. Keep Suicune asleep to prevent Roar, which ends the battle even with Mean Look.
- Turn 3+: NIGHT SHADE. Fixed damage equal to level (21) for safe chipping.
