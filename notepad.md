# Suicune Capture Strategy
## The Repel Trick
- Lead: KIMCHI (Lv 21 Gloom).
- Method: Super Repel filters wild Pokemon (Lv 13-16). Suicune (Lv 40) is the only possible encounter.
- Status: Super Repel active (Used Turn #13558). ~180 steps remaining.
- Inventory: Super Repel x7. Confirmed at Slot 15 in PACK.

## Suicune Battle Strategy
- Mechanics: Suicune (Base Speed 85) flees on Turn 1. KIMCHI (Base Speed 40) is slower.
- Plan: Inflict Sleep (Sleep Powder) to prevent fleeing in subsequent encounters. HP/Status are persistent.
- Catch Rate: ~0.39% (Full HP, No Status, Great Ball). Increases to ~4.3% if asleep.

## Route 38 Navigation
- Roamer Logic: Suicune moves routes ONLY when crossing map boundaries (Route 38/39 edge), using Fly, or after a battle.
- Boundary: Route 38 (0, 10) <-> Route 39 (19, 10).
