# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Reach the Dragon Shrine via the Far East Bypass (Column 28).

# Current Status (Turn 18319)
- **Location:** Dragon's Den B1F (16, 10).
- **Action:** Navigate East to Column 28.
- **Reasoning:** 
    - Re-analysis of the map shows a "Buoy Cage" in the center (Col 15-17 blocked by Rows 12 and 16).
    - The previous East attempt stopped at Col 26.
    - **Column 28** is clear of Buoys all the way down past Row 23!
    - This is the bypass.
- **Goal:** Reach (28, 10), then Surf South to (28, 24) to bypass the barriers.

# Plan
1. Navigate to (28, 10).
2. Surf South to (28, 24).
3. Navigate West/South to find a landing spot near the Shrine (19, 29).

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Barrier.
- **Buoy:** Barrier.
- **Column 28:** The secret passage.

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Requires HM06 Whirlpool + Glacier Badge. 
- **Lava/Magma:** (None here).
- **Ice:** (None here).

# Lessons
- **Menu Navigation:** Always verify cursor position before committing to a sequence. Blind input leads to wrong menus (e.g., PACK instead of POKEMON).
