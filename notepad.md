# Gem's Gameplay Log & Strategies

## 1. Game Mechanics & Lessons Learned
*   **Poison Damage:** Poisoned Pokémon lose 1 HP every four steps outside of battle.
*   **Battle Tactics:** If a move repeatedly fails (e.g., accuracy drops), switch to a guaranteed-hit move or a different Pokémon. Don't stick to a failing strategy.
*   **WKG Management:** Execute all tool calls from an agent's multi-step plan sequentially.
*   **NPC Sprites:** Defeated trainer sprites can sometimes temporarily block paths.
*   **Risk Management:** Avoid exploring deep into new, dangerous areas with a significantly injured party. Prioritize healing.
