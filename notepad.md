# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- **Quest Start:** Turn 48900
- **Status:** (11, 15) gap confirmed as dead end. Executing Southern Bypass.

## Execution Plan (Southern Bypass)
1. Walk to (13, 16) and Surf. <- CURRENT TASK
2. Surf East to (27, 27), then South to (27, 51).
3. Land at (24, 51) and walk West to (2, 51).
4. Walk North to (2, 12), then East to (14, 12).
5. Walk North to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

## Strategy: Southern Bypass
The city center is blocked by one-way ledges (Row 34, 46, 48, 50) and walls. To reach the western corridor (X=2), I must Surf around the south end of the map (Row 51). This avoids all city barriers.

## Failed Hypotheses & Lessons
- Island Hop (13, 16) via (11, 15): Dead end alcove at (11, 14).
- Inner Channel (X=12): Blocked at Row 15 by buoy wall.
- Terrestrial Path (South): Blocked by multiple ledge lines.
- Terrestrial Path (West): Blocked by wall lines at X=11, 9, 5, 3.

## Progress Summary
- All 16 Badges obtained.
- Elite Four/Red defeated.
- Current Focus: Suicune tracking.
