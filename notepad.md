# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- **Quest Start:** Turn 48900
- **Timestamp:** Turn 49419 (Resumed)
- **Status:** Investigating gap at (11, 15). Repel active (~190 steps).

## Execution Plan (Island Hop)
1. Walk to (12, 28) and use Surf. <- CURRENT TASK
2. Surf North to (14, 16) and land at (13, 16).
3. Walk West to (11, 16) and North through (11, 15).
4. Walk to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

## Strategy: Island Hop
The northern plateau is separated from the city by a line of walls and ledges at Row 15. A single FLOOR gap exists at (11, 15). This path is significantly more efficient than the Southern Bypass or Western Corridor terrestrial routes.

## Failed Hypotheses & Lessons
- Terrestrial Path (South): Blocked by multiple ledge lines (Row 34, 46, 48, 50).
- Terrestrial Path (West): Blocked by wall lines at X=11, 9, 5, 3.
- Inner Channel (X=12): Blocked at Row 15 by buoy wall.
- Previous "Dead End" Assessment: Re-evaluating (11, 15) gap; type is FLOOR, indicating traversability.

## Progress Summary
- All 16 Badges obtained.
- Elite Four/Red defeated.
- Current Focus: Suicune tracking.
