## Current Status
- **State:** S1=ON, S2=OFF, S3=ON.
- **Location:** At (10, 2). Facing Switch 2.
- **Action:** Turn Switch 2 ON.

## Strategic Goal
- **Objective:** Reach Emergency Switch at (20, 11).
- **Hypothesis:** The path is blocked by shutters. Need to find a combination that allows access to the South-East area.
- **Next Step:** Turn S2 ON. Enter Central Room via (10, 6). Explore connection to South.
