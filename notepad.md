## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- LADDER: Floor change (e.g. 1F to B1F).
- COUNTER: Face and press A to interact.
- LEDGE: Semi-traversable (jump down).

## Active Quest: Find Granddaughter
- Status: Investigating B1F. Sailor at (30, 6) has moved, opening the passage north. Sailor at (31, 6) remains.
- Clues: Energetic girl (1F); "lazy bum" buddy goofing off (B1F).
- Strategy: Bypass the sailor at (31, 6) by walking through (30, 6). Explore the western side of B1F to find the "lazy bum" buddy.

## Kanto Strategy
- Goal: Collect 8 Kanto badges.
- Target 1: Lt. Surge (Vermilion City).
- MVP: GNEISS (Graveler) Lv 51. Ground-type immunity to Electric.

## Lessons Learned
- S.S. Aqua sailors block corridors; check Game State for exact positions.
- Super Nerd (26, 9) blocks the x=26 corridor on B1F.
- Map transitions reset NPC positions and can progress scripted events.
- Path to western 1F is likely via B1F (East 1F -> East B1F -> West B1F -> West 1F).
