## Global Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable.
- WATER: Requires Surf.
- DOOR / WARP_CARPET: Warp point.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way South jump.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way North climb.
- SMASHABLE_ROCK (Object): Impassable. Requires Rock Smash.

## General Lessons
- **NPC Interaction:** Intercepting moving NPCs is more reliable than chasing them. Position in their walking path and wait.

## Failed Hypotheses
- Pokefan M (Main map): Hint only (Turn 50278, 50281). Possibly requires specific front-facing interaction or trigger.
- Mania (2, 4): Dead end (asks for Shuckle).
- Lass (14, 44): Dead end (talks about Chuck).
- Pharmacy (15, 47): Dead end (regular shop after 16 badges).
