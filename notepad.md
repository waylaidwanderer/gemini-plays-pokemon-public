# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026
- Current Location: National Park (Map 3_15)

### Immediate Goals
1. **Find Floria**: Explore the North-East corner of the National Park.
2. **Find Exit to Route 36**: Likely in the North-East.
3. **Get SquirtBottle**: Return to Flower Shop after finding Floria.

### Quest Log
- **Badges**: Zephyr, Hive, Plain.
- **Party**: All Healthy.
- **Mail Quest**: Active.
- **Contest**: Not entered (lack of Sport Balls/Bug Catching logic).

### Strategic Notes
- **Poison Alert**: Garnet is poisoned. No Antidote in bag. Prioritize reaching a Pokemon Center (Violet City East?) or finding Floria quickly.
- **SquirtBottle**: Requires Plain Badge (Have), inspecting tree (Done), and finding Floria.
- **Map Intel**: "North Gate" at (25,3) was invalid. Heading South-East to find the East Exit (Route 36).
### Reflection (Turn 11667)
- **Correction**: Map 11_10 is a HOUSE (likely Name Rater's), NOT the Gatehouse. There is no North exit.
- **Action**: Exiting back to Goldenrod City.
- **Plan**: Bypass this building to reach the real Gatehouse at the North edge of the map.
- **Navigation**: Will check path to the WEST (Left) of this building, as East was a dead end.
- **Quest**: Find Floria (Route 36) -> Get SquirtBottle.
