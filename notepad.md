# Current Strategy: Return to Red
- **Timestamp:** Turn 26399 (Jan 7, 2026) [Silver Cave Item Rooms]
- **Status:** Exploring the upper ledge of Item Rooms (3_77).
- **Immediate Goal:** Determine if the ledge at y=4 is jumpable or if this is a dead end.
- **Plan:**
  1. Test jumping DOWN at various x-coordinates along the ledge.
  2. If jumpable, explore lower area.
  3. If not, return to Room 2 via warp (13, 3) and look for another path (e.g., Warp 11, 5).
- **Hypothesis:** This ledge must lead somewhere or contain an item.

# Investigation List
- **Ledge (x, 4):** Testing if traversable.
- **Item Rooms (Main):** Likely the lower area (y>4).

# Tile Mechanics
- **WARP_CARPET_DOWN:** Must step DOWN onto this tile to trigger warp.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** South-facing Ledge at y=4.
  - **Status:** Exploring East side of Room 2 Lower at (21, 28).
- **Update:** Successfully navigated past warp carpets at x=21.
- **Objective:** Follow the corridor at x=22 North to see if it leads to the Upper Area or East side.
- **Plan:**
  1. Go North to (22, 24).
  2. Check for connections to the East (x>22).
  3. If dead end, check other columns.
- **Hypothesis:** The path to the rest of the map is hidden or requires a specific route in this lower area.
- **Item Rooms:** Upper Ledge confirmed dead end/entrance only. Loop verified.
