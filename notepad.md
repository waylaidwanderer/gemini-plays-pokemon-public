# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) in Cianwood City to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The West Beach Highway (Land Route)
- Plan:
  1. Walk to (6, 51) via (15, 30) -> (15, 44) -> (6, 44). [IN PROGRESS]
  2. Walk West along Row 51 to (2, 51).
  3. Walk North along West Beach (X=2) to (2, 12).
  4. Walk East along Row 12 to (14, 12).
  5. Walk North to (14, 10).
- Status: At (19, 30). Repel active.
- Reasoning: The city is divided by vertical walls and Row 15/30/46 cliffs. Row 51 is the only confirmed land bridge to the West Beach (X=2). X=2 is a clear vertical highway that bypasses all northern barriers. Row 12 provides the horizontal entry to the sighting spot.

# Blocked Routes (Verified)
- Central City: Vertical walls at X=5, X=9, X=11, X=17.
- Row 15 Barrier: Solid wall/ledge from X=3 to X=17.
- Row 30/34/46 Barriers: Impassable cliffs (FLOOR_UP_WALL).

# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard ground. Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Surf required. Traversable.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable cliff face.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
