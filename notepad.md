# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Location:** Route 28 (East Side).
- **Status:** Exploring East.
- **Action:** Move East to x=30, then North towards the Victory Road Gate.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Landed at (22, 11). To the West is a dead end (Wall at x=17).
  2. To the East is open terrain leading to the Gate area.
  3. Need to explore the Eastern side to see if there is a path wrapping around to the North-West (House).
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Need to explore all of Route 28.
  2. Accessing the Northern/Eastern part of Route 28 is the next step.
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.

# Tile Mechanics
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN:** One-way South.
- **LEDGE_HOP_LEFT:** One-way Left.
- **WARP_CARPET:** Step on to exit map.
- **CUT_TREE:** Obstacle unless Cut is used.
- **PIT:** Drops player to floor below.
- **LADDER:** Transitions between floors.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Walkable from South/Sides. Northbound exit is BLOCKED (Verified at 8,14). Acts as a one-way ledge preventing Northward movement.
- **BUOY:** Water boundary/Wall.

# Reflection (Turn 25132)
- **Status:** Exploring Mt. Silver Cave 1F.
- **Hygiene:** Notepad and Map Markers are up to date.
- **Goals:** Clear. Exploring North to find Red.
- **Strategy:** Testing if FLOOR_UP_WALL tiles at Row 20 are traversable from the South.
- **Tools:** Current set is sufficient.
