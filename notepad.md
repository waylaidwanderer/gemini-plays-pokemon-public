# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement. Passable from SOUTH to NORTH. Verified: Row 48 and 50 block downward progress.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at Row 15 (X=3-17).
- ROCK: Smashable rocks act as WALLs.
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- Started: Turn 49630
## Strategy: Super Repel Sea Route (The Final Plan)
Reach (14, 10) by surfing around the city using Super Repel to avoid battles.

2. Use SUPER REPEL from inventory.
3. Move to (23, 33) and SURF.
4. Surf North to (23, 15) (Gap 1).
5. Surf East to (27, 15) and North to (27, 9) (Gap 2).
6. Surf West to (19, 9) and South to (19, 11).
7. Land at (16, 11) and move North over ledge at (16, 10).
8. Walk to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

# Progress Notes
- Verified: Sea route buoy gaps are at (23, 15) and (27, 9).
- Verified: Landing point (16, 11) leads to the plateau.
- Item: Using SUPER REPEL to bypass wild encounters.
- Hypothesis: FLOOR_UP_WALL tiles allow NORTH movement but block SOUTH (Testing pending).
