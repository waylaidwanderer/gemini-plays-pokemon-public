# Ilex Forest Quest: Runaway Farfetch'd
*Started Turn 2803*

## Goal: Catch the bird to obtain HM01 (Cut).

## Puzzle Mechanics
- **Success Condition**: Interact from the tile directly behind the bird's facing direction.
- **Startle Logic**: Interacting from the front or side makes the bird fly ~6 tiles away.
- **Twig Logic**: Tiles with dark specs are noisy. Stepping on them makes the bird turn to face the sound.
- **Noisy Tiles (Specs)**: 
  - Row 26: (14, 26), (15, 26)
  - Row 28: (14, 28) to (18, 28)
  - Row 29: (17, 29), (18, 29)
  - Row 31: (23, 31) to (29, 31)
- **Verified Clean Tiles**: Row 23, Row 24, Row 25, Row 27, Row 30. (14-16, 29) are clean.

## Current Status
- Bird at (15, 25). Facing: RIGHT.
- Strategy: 
  1. Move to (15, 26) (Noisy) to make bird face DOWN.
  2. Circle around via Row 30 and Row 23 (Clean) to reach (15, 24).
  3. Interact from behind (South) while bird faces North? No, catch from (15, 24) while bird faces DOWN.

## Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR**: Passable. Clean ground.
- **TWIGS**: Noisy floor (specs). Alerts bird.
- **WALL / DENSE_TREES**: Impassable.
- **HEADBUTT_TREE**: Impassable.
- **CUT_TREE**: Impassable. Requires HM01 Cut.
