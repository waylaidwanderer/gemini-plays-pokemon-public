# Suicune Hunt Strategy (Crystal)
- Started: Turn 22256 (Friday, Dec 26, 2025).
- Trigger Logic: Proximity-based sighting sequence. Suicune roams ONLY after the Tin Tower event if not caught.
- Sighting 3 (Route 42): Proximity trigger on central island (X:22-30, Y:12-17). Landing at (26, 15) from south is the recommended approach.
- Sighting 4: Route 36 (Sudowoodo junction).
- Sighting 5: Tin Tower 1F (Final).

## Quest Timestamps
- Turn 23337: Ecruteak/Route 42 West Gatehouse hopping started.
- Turn 23387: Route 36 junction attempt (failed). Agent confirmed Route 42 sighting is mandatory.
- Turn 23389: Flying to Ecruteak to restart Route 42 sequence.

## Current Sighting Plan: Route 42
1. Fly to Ecruteak City.
2. Enter Route 42 from the West Gatehouse.
3. Surf to the central island.
4. Approach the Apricorn trees (approx. 26, 14).
5. If trigger fails, perform map reset (Ecruteak boundary).
