# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Active Strategy: The Southern Clearway Sprint
The northern plateau (14, 10) is only accessible via the Western Corridor (X=0-2). This corridor is blocked from the main city by a long North-South wall. I must reach the southern clearway at Row 51, which provides a land path to the corridor.

### Current Plan (Turn 49918)
- **Objective:** Reach the southern clearway at (21, 51).
- **Route:** (13, 44) -> (13, 49) -> (18, 49) -> (21, 49) -> (21, 51).
- **Status:** Moving to (21, 51).

## Lessons Learned & Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** This tile type acts as an impassable wall when moving **Down** (North to South). It is NOT jumpable. Confirmed at Row 50, Row 46, and Row 34.
- **City Wall:** A massive wall divides the city at X=16-20 and X=5-9. Gaps are rare.
- **Row 50 Gaps:** Reachable via X=4-11 and X=20-24.
- **Western Corridor:** X=0-2 is the only land path to the northern plateau.

## Progress Tracking
- **Suicune Quest Start:** Turn 49885.
