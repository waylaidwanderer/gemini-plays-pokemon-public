# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Stop Team Rocket.
- **Secondary Goal:** Fly to Goldenrod City.
- **Next Task:** Investigate Radio Tower (Team Rocket takeover).

## Action Log
- **Status:** Inside Name Rater's House.
- **Correction:** The door at (15, 7) was the Name Rater, NOT the Radio Tower.
- **Plan:** Exit and head further East/North. Check the door at (29, 5) or (24, 7).
- **Hypothesis:** The Radio Tower is likely the large structure in the North-East block (east of the train tracks).

## Tile Mechanics
- **ICE:** Stepping onto this tile forces the player to slide in the current direction until they hit a WALL, OBJECT, or FLOOR tile. **Confirmed: Sliding stops on FLOOR tiles.**
- **FLOOR:** Safe to walk/stop.
- **Trap Tiles:** B1F corridors (Geodude/Voltorb/Koffing) - *Rocket Hideout*.
- **Security Cameras:** Trigger alarms/battles - *Rocket Hideout*.
