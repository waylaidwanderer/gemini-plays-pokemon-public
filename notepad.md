# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement (acting as a ledge). Passable from SOUTH to NORTH.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at Row 15 (X=3-17).
- ROCK: Smashable rocks act as WALLs.
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
## Strategy: The Great Southern Bypass (Verified)
Reach (14, 10) by bypassing all internal obstacles via the far southern and western corridors.
1. Move to (24, 45).
2. Move South along X=24 to (24, 51).
3. Move West along Row 51 to (2, 51).
4. Move North along X=2 corridor to (2, 12).
5. Move East along Row 12 to (14, 12).
6. Move North to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

# Progress Notes
- Verified: X=24 corridor is clear from Row 44 to Row 51.
- Verified: Row 51 is a clear horizontal path from X=24 to X=4.
- Verified: X=2 corridor is clear from Row 51 up to Row 12.
- Verified: Row 12 is a clear horizontal path from X=2 to X=14.
- Blocked: All internal corridors (X=4, 6, 10, 12) have SOUTH-facing ledges (FLOOR_UP_WALL) that prevent reaching the northern plateau from within the city.
- Blocked: Sea Route is restricted by complex buoy walls.
- Hallucination Note: FLOOR_UP_WALL tiles block SOUTH movement but allow NORTH movement. Row 48 and Row 50 are the primary ledge barriers.
