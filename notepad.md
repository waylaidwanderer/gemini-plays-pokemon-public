# Suicune Hunt Strategy (Crystal)
- Status: ROAMING (Post-Tin Tower).
- Lead: XENON (Gastly Lv21) with Mean Look and Hypnosis.
- Strategy: Boundary cycling between Route 38 and Ecruteak City.

# Suicune Battle Plan
- Item: QUICK CLAW (Priority: National Park).
- Turn 1: MEAN LOOK.
- Turn 2+: HYPNOSIS. (Priority: KEEP ASLEEP to prevent ROAR).
- Turn 3+: NIGHT SHADE (fixed damage).
- Failsafe 1: Suicune has ROAR. Even with Mean Look, Roar will end the battle. Keep it asleep!
- Failsafe 2: If Suicune flees on Turn 1 before Mean Look, the Quick Claw is required for a speed-tie chance.

- Location: National Park.
- NPC: Lady with Persian on a bench in the northeast area.
- Access: Enter National Park from Route 35 (3, 5).
