# Suicune Quest (Crystal) - PROGRESS
- Milestone 1-4: Burned Tower, Cianwood, Route 42, Route 36 sightings complete.
- Milestone 5: Tin Tower (Verification Required). 
- Note: Clear Bell is still in inventory. This strongly implies the Tin Tower event has NOT been completed, as the bell is consumed to summon Suicune. 
- Goal: Verify Tin Tower status in Ecruteak City (18, 11).

## Strategy
1. **Buy Super Repels:** Currently at Ecruteak Mart. (Started Turn 18301).
   - Buy 4 Super Repels (¥2000). 
   - These are for the future roaming hunt.
2. **Verify Tin Tower:** Head to Tin Tower (18, 11) immediately after the Mart. 
   - If Suicune is stationary, engage.
   - If the path is blocked, resolve prerequisites (Ecruteak Gym/Kimono Girls - already done).
3. **Hunt:** Only if Suicune is confirmed roaming (Pokedex AREA map shows a route AND Clear Bell is gone).
