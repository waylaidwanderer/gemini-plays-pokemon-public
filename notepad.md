# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Cross the whirlpool to reach the Dragon Shrine.

# Key Mechanics & Lessons
- **Field Moves:** If 'A' interaction fails (even when facing correctly), ALWAYS fallback to Menu -> Pokemon -> [Mon] -> [Move].
- **Whirlpool:** Requires facing the whirlpool tile directly. 'A' button might be unreliable; Menu is safer.

- Status: Correction - Exiting Menus & Facing Down.
- Reason: "Can't use that here" confirms I was facing UP. Previous attempt to face down failed due to menu interactions consuming the input.
- Step 1: Press 'B' multiple times (x4) to close all nested menus (Error msg -> Submenu -> Party -> Main -> Field).
- Step 2: Press 'Down' to face the whirlpool.
- Step 3: Verify 'Facing: Down' in Game State before attempting Whirlpool again.
