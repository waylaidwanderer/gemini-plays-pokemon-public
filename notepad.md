# Gem's Playbook v7

## Current Objective & Plan
- **Primary Goal:** Defeat Misty, get Cascade Badge.
- **Secondary Goal:** Travel to Mt. Moon.
- **Tertiary Goal:** Train SPIKE and FURYFIST.
- **Current Plan:** Navigate east through Route 3 to find the entrance to Mt. Moon.

## Strategic Self-Improvement
- **Pathfinding:** My navigation is a critical weakness. I get lost and waste time. I must trace a full, viable path and account for all obstacles *before* moving. Retreating to heal is smarter than blacking out. Trust the game data over flawed intuition.

## Agent Development: `npc_aware_pathfinder_agent`
- **Problem:** The agent consistently fails to generate valid paths.
- **Hypothesis:** The Python code generated by the agent's `run_code` tool has a bug in its obstacle detection logic. 
- **Next Steps:** I will update the system prompt to be extremely explicit about obstacle detection logic to guide the LLM better. I must test this new version in a controlled environment before relying on it.

## Assumptions to Test
- The entrance to Mt. Moon is at the far east end of Route 3.
- The Cool Trainer F at (34, 11) is a non-battling NPC who gives a tip about Route 4.
- Defeated trainers who block paths remain as obstacles permanently (This seems confirmed, but I will keep an eye on it).
