# Blackthorn Gym (Puzzle Progress)
- Start Turn: 34763 (Jan 8, 10:15 AM)
- Pits: P1 (8, 3), P2 (2, 5), P3 (8, 7)
- Boulders: B6 (3, 3), B7 (6, 1), B8 (8, 15)
- Status: Strength ACTIVE (Turn 34932)

## Tile Mechanics (2F)
- Vertical Barriers: Column 4 (Row 0-12), Column 2 (Row 10-17), Column 9 (Row 12-17).
- Center Block: (6, 2-4, 6), (7, 4, 6).
- Navigation Gaps: (4, 13) connects left/right, (5, 4) is a narrow vertical passage.
- Dead Ends: Column 8 (Row 10-17) is blocked by walls at (8, 8-9).

## Puzzle Plan
- Observation: B8 (8, 15) is trapped in Column 8 if Column 9 is a solid wall.
- Test Results: (9, 13) is WALL (Turn 34983).
- Next Test: (9, 14) - Move from (8, 14).
- Goal: Determine if B8 can be moved out of Column 8.
- Strategy: If B8 is trapped, reset puzzle and reconsider boulder assignments.
- Lesson (Turn 34984): Reflection complete. Systematically verifying boundaries is slow but necessary for accurate automation.
