# Suicune Quest Strategy: 'The Great Buoy Loop'
- Goal: Reach Suicune at (7, 4).
- Fact 1: The northern plateau is isolated by the Row 15 wall. Land access from the south is blocked by one-way ledges.
- Fact 2: The northern water is isolated by two main buoy walls: X=26 (Rows 0-9) and X=19 (Rows 15-20).
- Solution: Use the gaps in the buoy walls to sail around the barriers.
- Route:
    1. From (21, 44), move to (19, 30) and Surf.
    2. Sail to (27, 30) -> (27, 10).
    3. Cross X=26 wall via gap at (26, 10) to reach (25, 10).
    4. Sail to (25, 8).
    5. Cross Row 9 wall via gap at (22, 8) to reach (21, 8).
    6. Sail West to (14, 8), bypassing the X=19 wall (which ends at Row 14).
    7. Sail South to (14, 10) and land.
    8. Walk to Suicune at (7, 4).
- Preparation: Lead with XENON (Haunter) for Hypnosis. Be ready for Eusine.
- Status: At (21, 44). Returning to (19, 30) to start the loop.
- Failed Hypotheses:
    - Western Beach Walk (Attempts: 3): Blocked by Row 15 wall and one-way ledges.
    - Island Bypass (Surf South) (Attempts: 1): Unnecessary.
- Start Turn: 47680 (Suicune North Beach Quest)
