4. Return to Blackthorn City for Gym challenge.

# Strategy: Rising Badge (Gym Leader Clair)
- Team: Xenon (Haunter), Kimchi (Gloom), Calcifer (Typhlosion), Gneiss (Graveler).
- Plan: Use Night Shade (Xenon) for fixed damage. Use Sleep Powder/Hypnosis for control.
- Kingdra Strategy: Use Sleep Powder (Kimchi) and Night Shade (Xenon) to bypass defenses.
- Speed Control: Teach TM16 Icy Wind to Naga or Blitz to slow down Dragonairs. (Note: TM16 not in PC or Inventory).
- Survival: Level supports to Lv40+ to survive hits.
- Party Management: Swap low-level members (Icarus, Ravioli) for stronger PC options (Naga Lv42, Blitz Lv40) before challenging.

# Training Log: Route 35 (Swarm)
- Strategy: Lead with Gneiss (Lv46) to handle encounters quickly while Xenon gains Exp. via Exp. Share. Using the swarm as a high-encounter-rate training opportunity for Xenon and Kimchi (Tertiary Goal).
