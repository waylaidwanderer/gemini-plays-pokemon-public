# Suicune Event Analysis
- **Critical Failure:** Battled Suicune at Tin Tower 1F and WHITED OUT.
- **Current State:**
    - Suicune is GONE from Tin Tower 1F.
    - Warp to Roof (10,2) is INACTIVE.
    - Wise Trio Sages are GONE from their room (Barrier Station).
    - "The TIN TOWER shook!" flag is ACTIVE.
- **Hypothesis:** 
    1. Suicune might have reset to a roaming state.
    2. Suicune might have returned to a previous location (Cianwood, Route 42).
    3. The event might be "failed" until Elite Four (worst case).
    4. The Wise Trio moved to a location I missed (e.g., outside on the trail, or hidden in the tower).
