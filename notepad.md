## Quest: Deliver Kenya (Route 31)
1.  **Status:** PC Purge Complete.

- **Dark Cave:** Connects Route 31, 45, 46. Requires Flash/Rock Smash/Surf.
- **Bug Catcher Wade:** Route 31. Calls for swarms.

## Log & Lessons
- **Turn 9354:** Restarting mail fix. Lesson: "One in, one out" mail management is inefficient. Doing mass purge.
- **Turn 9200:** "Printer Error" loop caused by pressing Start in Mail menu. Use B to cancel.
- **Turn 9296:** Game asks to send mail to PC when removing. Must say NO if rewriting, or YES if discarding to PC.
