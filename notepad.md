# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement (acting as a ledge). Passable from SOUTH to NORTH.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at Row 15 (X=3-17).
- ROCK: Smashable rocks act as WALLs.
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- Started: Turn 49630
## Strategy: The Sea Route Bypass (Final)
Reach (14, 10) by surfing around the city via the eastern gap.
1. Move to (23, 33) and SURF.
2. Surf North to (27, 9) (Gap in Row 9 buoy wall).
3. Surf West to (17, 9) and land on the plateau.
4. Walk to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

# Progress Notes
- Blocked: All land routes (X=2, 4, 6, 12) are blocked by walls or SOUTH-blocking ledges.
- Blocked: Central sea (X=12-15) is blocked by the Row 15 land wall.
- Verified: Row 32 is a clear horizontal path from X=12 to X=23.
- Verified: (27, 9) is a clear gap in the buoy walls leading to the Northern Sea.
- Verified: (16, 11) and nearby tiles are landing points for the plateau.
