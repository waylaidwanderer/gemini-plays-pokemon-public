# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) in Cianwood City to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The Row 29 Skyline Path
- Plan:
  1. Use Super Repel. [DONE]
  2. Walk to (15, 29) via (18, 30). [IN PROGRESS]
  3. Walk West along Row 29 to (2, 29).
  4. Walk North along West Beach (X=2) to (2, 12).
  5. Walk East along Row 12 to (14, 12), then North to (14, 10).
- Status: At (25, 37) on land. Repel active.
- Reasoning: Row 29 is a continuous land bridge from X=15 to X=2, bypassing the central city walls and the Row 30 cliff. X=2 is a clear vertical highway to the northern plateau. Row 12 provides horizontal access to the sighting spot.

# Blocked Routes (Verified)
- Central City Land: Blocked at Row 13 (X=9-12 Wall) and Row 15 (X=12-17 Wall). No direct land path through center.
- Central City Maze: Vertical walls at X=5 and X=9.
- Row 30/34/46 Cliffs: Impassable FLOOR_UP_WALL barriers.
- Inner Channel: Buoy wall at Row 15 (X=18-22).

# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard ground. Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Surf required. Traversable.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable cliff face.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
