# Reflection (Turn 26797)
- **Execution:** No deferred tasks. Stall strategy is active and working.
- **Hygiene:** Notepad is up to date with turn counts.
- **Analysis:** Pivoted correctly from attacking to stalling after realizing Cross Chop was ineffective and Psychic was a 2HKO.
- **Automation:** Manual battle control is safer to handle critical hits/status effects dynamically.

# Key Findings
- **Silver Cave:** Room 2 Warp (11, 5) led directly to Room 3 (Red's Chamber), not Item Rooms.
