## persistence Knowledge
### Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Traversable. Confirmed in KarensRoom (16_6).
- WALL: Impassable. Confirmed in KarensRoom (16_6).
- LADDER: Traversable. Transition to another map.
- WARP_CARPET: Walking off map edge triggers transition.
- DARKNESS: Visual effect only, does not affect movement.

### Lessons Learned
- Hypnosis Failure: Don't overthink misses (60% accuracy). It's rarely immunity unless specified.
- Menu Precision: Always verify cursor position before pressing A. Use small sequences.
- Rock Slide: Machamp has Rock coverage. Be careful with Flying/Fire/Bug types.
- Gengar (Ghost): Immune to Normal moves (Return).

### Menu Navigation
- Main Menu Order: POKEDEX, POKEMON, PACK, GEAR, [PLAYER], SAVE, OPTION, EXIT.
- Party Sub-Menu Order: STATS, SWITCH, ITEM, CANCEL.

## Lead Swap Attempts (Karen)
- Attempts 1-8 failed due to menu cursor errors and HM move offsets.
- HM Sub-menu logic: HM moves appear at the top. ICARUS has FLY, making SWITCH the 3rd option (Down x2).
- Lesson: For overworld swaps, use a custom tool or very slow manual sequences with verification.
## Battle with Karen (Cont.)
- Turn 37476-37477: Calcifer (115/174 HP) vs Murkrow (Healthy).
- Move Selection: Thunderpunch (Super Effective).
- Goal: One-shot Murkrow.
