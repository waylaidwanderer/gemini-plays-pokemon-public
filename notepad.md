# Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Reach Blackthorn City via Ice Path.
- **Current Status:** In Ice Path 1F at (29, 13).
- **Mechanics:** 
  - **Ice Tiles:** Player slides until hitting an obstacle or non-ice tile.
  - **Ledges:** One-way jumps.
- **Navigation:**
  - Entrance: (4, 19).
  - **Path Discovery:**
    - The area North of Row 13 (x=25-30) appears to be the bottom of a ledge drop-off (Row 10).
    - This suggests the current path (South-East Path) is an **Exit** from the upper area.
    - Investigating West at Row 12 to confirm dead end.
  - **Plan:**
    1. Check (25, 12) to confirm no Westward passage.
    2. Backtrack to the ice interface at (19, 23).
    3. Navigate ice to find the "North Path" or return to entrance.

# Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR:** Walkable.
- **WALL:** Impassable.
