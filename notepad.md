# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Timestamp:** Turn 25784 (Jan 6, 2026)
- **Primary Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Immediate Task:** Explore Silver Cave Room 1 (Northern Section).
- **Sequence:**
    1. Navigate West from (13, 9) to (9, 9).
    2. Go North to (9, 8).
    3. Explore the North-West area (x<9, y<8).

# Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Acts as a South-facing Ledge (verified). Blocks North movement (cannot pass Up through it).
- **Maze Solution:** The path at (8, 18) connects the West and East sections.
- **Navigation Notes:**
    - East Section access via (9, 18).
    - Wall at (15, 13-9) separates the East corridors.
    - Path North seems to be via the gap at (9, 8).
