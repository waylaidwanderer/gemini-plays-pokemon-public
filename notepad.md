# Kanto Campaign Status
- **Location:** Cerulean Pokemon Center.
- **Current Objective:** Reach the Power Plant via Route 9.
- **Immediate Task:** Execute Menu Sequence to Cut tree: Exit Menu (B x4), Start, Up, A (Pokemon), Down x5 (Belladonna), A, A (Cut).
- **Observation:** Direct 'A' interaction with the tree failed multiple times. The tree is not listed as a Map Object, suggesting it's a tile. If Menu Cut fails, the tree is likely not cuttable, and the path forward is through the house at (30, 23).
- **Hypothesis:** This tree might be the "Burgled House" backyard access point, requiring passage through the house instead of Cutting. But testing Cut via Menu is the definitive check.

# Strategic Goals
1. **Restore Power:**
   - Investigate Power Plant (East of Cerulean, end of Route 9).
   - Fix the Generator (likely requires a part).
2. **Wake Snorlax:**
