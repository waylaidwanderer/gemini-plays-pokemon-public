# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard walkable ground.
- WATER: Traversable only while Surfing.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable from the NORTH. Verified at (23, 46).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Impassable from the NORTH (can only jump SOUTH).

# Map Insights (Route 42)
- Middle grove with Apricorns requires Cut at (24, 13).
- Three Mt. Mortar entrances.
- Island is reachable via western pond (Surf) or Mt. Mortar middle entrance.

# Pokedex / Party Planning
- Missing Suicune.
- Need to check Roaming Beasts (Raikou/Entei) progress later.

# Lessons Learned
- Eusine battle confirms sighting completion.
- Buoy walls are highly restrictive; land routes often safer.
- Trigger for Route 42 sighting is likely a specific tile in the grove or near the cave.

# Suicune sighting on Route 42 Hypothesis
- Hypothesis 1: Walking on a specific tile in the (26, 15) grove triggers the sighting.
- Test 1: "Mow the lawn" across all reachable tiles in the grove (Rows 13-16, X=24-31).
- Conclusion 1: PENDING (Initial pass at (26, 15) failed).
- Hypothesis 2: Trigger is near the middle Mt. Mortar entrance at (28, 9).
- Test 2: Walk around (28, 9) and (28, 10).
- Conclusion 2: PENDING

# Systematic Search Plan (Route 42 Grove)
1. Cut tree at (24, 13).
2. Walk every tile from X=24 to X=31, Y=13 to Y=17.
3. Also check Mt. Mortar middle entrance at (28, 9).
