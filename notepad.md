# Radio Tower Crisis (Started Turn 8588)
## Strategy (HOW)
1. Floor-by-floor sweep (1F -> 5F).
2. Defeat all Rocket Grunts and Executives.
3. Find the Director (5F/Basement).
4. Pass the quiz on 1F for the Radio Card.
5. POST-SWEEP: Re-verify 1F for any missed trainers.
6. BATTLE TIP: Use Ember against Poison/Flying types (like Zubat/Golbat) to conserve Headbutt PP, as Typhlosion's Special Attack is superior. Use Headbutt against Normal/Psychic types.
7. TILE VERIFICATION: Poké Ball tiles (5,4; 7,6; 1,6) appear to be decorations as they are not in the object list.
