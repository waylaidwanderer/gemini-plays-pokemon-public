# Suicune Event State (Turn 15949)
- **Status:** Suicune missing from (9,9) after White Out.
- **Global Flag:** "The TIN TOWER shook!" (Confirmed by Wandering Sage in Barrier Station).
- **Local State:** 
    - Tin Tower 1F Sages: All 3 give generic lore (No reaction to shake).
    - Warp at (10,2): Inactive.
    - Suicune Spawn: Empty.
- **Action:** Forced map reload by exiting to City. Re-entering now.
- **Plan:** 
    1. Check Suicune spawn and Warp one last time.
    2. If failed, FIND EUSINE (likely in Barrier Station Left Side or City).

# Barrier Station Layout
- Left Side: Connects to City. Contains Gramps/Eusine?
- Right Side: Connects to Tin Tower.
- Connected via Wise Trio Room ladders.

# Tile Mechanics
- **WARP_CARPET:** Some require specific directional input (e.g. Down to exit Tower).
- Action: Returning to Wise Trio Room/Barrier Station to find Eusine.
- Path: From Tin Tower (37,8) -> Gap at (30,4) -> Wise Trio Room Entrance (20,3).
