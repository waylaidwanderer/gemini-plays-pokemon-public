# Strategy: Trigger Suicune Sighting (Started: Turn 51131)
- City Logic: The city is divided into vertical corridors by walls. The Western Corridor (X=0-2) is the only clear path to the northern coast land-wise. Row 15 and Row 30-40 walls block other land routes. Water is blocked by a complex buoy grid.
- Execution Plan:
  1. Navigate to (12, 46) to bypass the X=9 wall and central buildings.
  2. Walk West to (2, 46) to enter the Western Corridor.
  3. Hike North to (2, 12), then East to (14, 12).
  4. Move North to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.
- Battle Prep: Lead Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion).
- Note: Avoid water routes (buoy maze) and central land routes (wall barriers). Row 46/51 are the primary southern cross-corridors.

# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard traversable tile.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable collision.
- WATER: Traversable only while using SURF.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way passage (South only).
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way passage (North only). Also known as terraces.
- ROCK (Object): Impassable until cleared with ROCK SMASH.
