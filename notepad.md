# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement. Passable from SOUTH to NORTH (Testing pending).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at Row 15 (X=3-17).
- ROCK: Smashable rocks act as WALLs.
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- Started: Turn 49630
## Strategy: The Internal Gap Highway
Reach (14, 10) by navigating internal corridors via specific gaps.
1. Land at (23, 33) and move West to (10, 33).
2. Move West through gap at (9, 33) to (6, 33).
3. Move North along X=6 to (6, 26).
4. Move West through gap at (5, 26) to (4, 26).
5. Move North along X=4 to (4, 22).
6. Move West through gap at (3, 22) to (2, 22).
7. Move North along X=2 to (2, 12) (Bypasses Row 15 ledge).
8. Move East along Row 12 to (14, 12) and North to (14, 10).

# Progress Notes
- Verified: X=2 corridor is clear through Row 15.
- Verified: Row 12 is a clear horizontal highway from X=5 to X=16.
- Verified: Gaps at (9, 33), (5, 26), and (3, 22) allow crossing vertical walls.
- Blocked: Sea route is a complex buoy maze.
- Blocked: X=10 corridor blocked by wall at Row 40.
