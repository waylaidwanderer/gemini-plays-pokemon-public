# Blackthorn Gym Boulder Puzzle
- Start Turn: 30123
- Current Turn: 30246
- Boulders: B6 (3, 3), B7 (6, 1), B8 (8, 15).
- Pits: P1 (2, 5), P2 (8, 3), P3 (8, 7).
- NPCs: Cody (4, 1), Fran (4, 11). Both solid.
- Strength: Active (Turn 30245).

# Strategy: Phase 1 - Maneuver
1. Move to (8, 16) via (8, 14)->(8, 13)->(7, 13)->(6, 13)->(6, 17)->(8, 17)->(8, 16).
2. Push B8 north to (8, 12).
3. Find and verify B6 and B7 locations.

# Map Observations
- Gym is split by Column 4 and Column 2 walls.
- Only crossing is 1F (resets boulders) or Row 1/11 (blocked by NPCs).
- Row 13 crossing is blocked by wall at (2, 13).
- Therefore, boulders must be solved from the side they are on.
