- Status: Strength ACTIVE (Turn 34932)

## Tile Mechanics (2F)
- WALL: (0, 0-17), (9, 0-17), (4, 0-12), (6, 2-4, 6), (7, 4, 6, 10, 11, 14, 15), (8, 0, 4, 8, 9), (2, 2, 8, 10-17), (5, 0, 10, 12, 16, 17), (3, 0, 8), (1, 0, 2)

- LADDER: (1, 7), (7, 9)
- FLOOR: (6, 10), (5, 4) gap, (4, 13) gap

## Puzzle Strategy (2F) - Systematic Re-Verification
- Observation: B8 (8, 14) appears trapped by confirmed walls.
- Hypothesis: One of the walls at (7, 10), (7, 14), (7, 15), (9, 10), (9, 14), or (9, 15) is actually a floor.
- Goal: Verify these tiles to find the path for B8.
- Test 1: (7, 10) - Move from (6, 10).
- Test 2: (7, 14) - Move from (6, 14).
- Test 3: (5, 10) and (5, 12) - Re-verify.
