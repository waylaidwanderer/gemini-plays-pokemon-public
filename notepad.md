# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Active Strategy: The Great Sea Loop
The northern plateau (14, 10) is isolated by ledges and walls. The only entrance is via the Western Corridor (X=0-2), which is blocked from the East by city-wide ledges. I must Surf around the southern tip of the island to reach the western shore.

1. Heal at the Pokemon Center (23, 43). (Completed)
2. Walk to the shore at (27, 44). (In Progress)
3. Surf East, then South to Row 51.
4. Surf West along Row 51 to (2, 51).
5. Land and walk North through the Western Corridor to Row 12.
6. Walk East to the plateau and trigger Suicune at (14, 10).

## Verified Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable wall (Confirmed at Row 50, X=12). Not jumpable.
- Western Corridor: X=0-2 is the only path to the northern plateau.
- Southern Shore: Reachable via water at Row 51.
