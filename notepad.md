# Hall of Fame Entry
- **Achievement:** **CHAMPION OF THE JOHTO LEAGUE!**
- **Date:** Turn 33314
- **MVP:** Muscle (Machoke) Lv88.

# Reflection (Turn 35459)
- **Roamer Mechanics:** Simple border hopping (Route 37 <-> Ecruteak) failed to randomize Roamers on distant routes (38/42). Fly is the next hypothesis to force randomization.
- **Hygiene:** Menu navigation must be step-by-step. Long macros fail.
- **Exploration:** Unseen areas on Route 38 (South) noted but skipped for now to prioritize restocking Repels.
- **Inventory:** Critical low on Repels. Must sell items at Ecruteak Mart.

# Roamer Hunt Log
- **Session Start:** Turn 34090.
- **Goal:** Encounter Raikou/Entei on Route 37.
- **Strategy:** Hunt Roamers on Route 38 (Current loc: R38/R42).
- **Party:** Gyarados (Lv36) w/ Repel.
- **Status:** Turn 35498 - On Fly Map (Cherrygrove). Navigating to Goldenrod (Left -> Violet, Down -> Goldenrod?). Checking destination.

# Lessons Learned
- **Static Roamers:** Border hopping (Route 37 <-> Ecruteak) failed to move Roamers from Routes 38/42 for >100 turns.
- **RNG Reset:** Entering a building (Pokemon Center) did not immediately move them either.
- **Solution:** Using Fly to randomize positions is the next logical step when soft methods fail.
