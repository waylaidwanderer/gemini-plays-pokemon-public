# Active Strategy: The Suicune Pursuit
- **Goal:** Trigger Suicune sighting at (14, 10) in northern Cianwood.
- **Battle Prep:** Lead with Lv64 Calcifer to sweep Eusine's team (Drowzee, Haunter, Electrode).
- **Active Plan (The Sea Loop):**
  1. Surf to (6, 52) on Route 41, then loop to (0, 51) to bypass buoy walls.
  2. Transition Left to Cianwood (29, 51) and land on Row 51.
  3. Walk West on Row 51 to (2, 51).
  4. Walk North via X=2 corridor to (2, 10).
  5. Walk East on Row 10 to (14, 10) for the sighting.
- **Verification:** Route 41 buoy gap at (6, 50-51) and Row 52 confirmed clear. X=2 corridor is clear of one-way barriers.
