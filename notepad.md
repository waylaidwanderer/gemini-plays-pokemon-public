# Suicune Quest Log (Crystal Version)
- Prerequisites: Clear Bell (Obtained).
- Quest Start: Turn 24182 (Timestamp: Saturday, Dec 27, 2025, 9:35 AM PST).
- Loop Start: Turn 26164 (Stuck on sightings).

## Current Strategy
- Plan:
  1. Navigate to Tin Tower Gatehouse (18, 11).
  2. Talk to Sages to verify "Tower Shook" event status.
  3. Enter Wise Trio Room (Map 4_2 via (20, 2)) and check for the Trio battle triggers.
  4. If Trio is absent, re-consult Suicune tracker with new data.
  5. If still stuck, attempt to reach Blackthorn City for the 8th badge.

## Lessons Learned
- Suicune events are strictly linear.
- Eusine's location depends on quest progress.
- Sages granting passage to Tin Tower indicates the "Clear Bell" event is active.
- Verification is key: Marker at (11, 20) confirms defeat, but sightings failure suggests missing flag or sequence issue.
