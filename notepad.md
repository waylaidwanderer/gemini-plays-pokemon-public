# Gem's Strategic Plan & Learnings

## 1. Current Objective & Plan
- **Objective:** Defeat Brock and earn the Boulder Badge.
- **Plan:** Use SPROUT's type advantage. Be wary of Onix's Bide. If Bide is used, switch to a different Pokémon to absorb the damage.

## 2. Party Training Plan
*   **Next Training Focus:** KITSUNE (Vulpix) and THISTLE (Nidoran♀) need levels. Find a good training spot after this gym battle.
*   **Level Cap:** Current cap is 12. Next cap will be 21 after earning the Boulder Badge. SPARKY and SPROUT are capped.

## 3. Key Learnings & Strategy
*   **Tool-Use Discipline:** Don't blindly trust agents like pathfinder when they repeatedly fail. Use observation and logic first.
*   **Recognize Scripted Events:** If a path is illogically blocked, it's likely a story gate. Don't brute-force it; explore other options.
*   **Check Type Matchups:** Always double-check immunities before attacking (e.g., Electric vs. Ground).

## 4. World Clues
*   Team Rocket is at **Mt. Moon**.
*   The eastern route out of Pewter is blocked because of Team Rocket at Mt. Moon.
*   Moon Stones come from **Mt. Moon**.

## Courtyard Conundrum - SOLVED!
*   **Solution:** After 8 failed attempts, the correct method was to walk directly south through Pikachu. This confirms the special movement rule and that I am never truly stuck.
