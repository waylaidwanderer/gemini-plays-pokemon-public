# Strategy: Rising Badge (Gym Leader Clair)
- Level Target: Xenon and Kimchi to Lv40 (Target: 56660 EXP).
- Tactical Plan: Lead with Xenon (Immune to Selfdestruct). Use Night Shade for fixed damage. Gneiss for physical bulk and STAB Earthquake. Calcifer's Thunderpunch for coverage.
- Prepare for Kingdra: Use status (Sleep Powder) or high Sp.Def tanks. Teach Ice-type moves if possible.
- Stock up on Full Heals in Blackthorn to handle paralysis.

# Strategy: Johto League Training
- Method: Switch-training. Lead with Xenon (Safety vs Selfdestruct), switch to finisher (Gneiss/Calcifer).
- Efficiency: Grind in Route 45 grass (4,12)-(5,12).
- Resource Management: Return to Blackthorn PC via FLY when PP or HP is critical.
- Grinding Session 1: Started Turn #31060.

# Ground-Type Safety Protocol (Lethal Threat)
- Problem: Xenon (Poison/Ghost) is weak to Ground (Magnitude/Earthquake).
- Solution: NEVER switch Xenon into Ground-types if they are likely to use Ground moves.
- Safe Alternative: Icarus (Immune) or Gneiss/Calcifer.
