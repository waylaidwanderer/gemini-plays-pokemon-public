# Suicune Sighting Strategy (Pokemon Crystal)
## Primary Goal: Trigger Suicune Sightings
- Suicune is NOT a roamer in Crystal until after the Tin Tower event. It follows a scripted sequence of overworld sightings.
- Sighting 1: North of Cianwood City (Completed).
- Sighting 2: Route 42 Middle Island (Current Target). Triggered by approaching the sprite on the island.
- Sighting 3: Route 36 (Next Target). Triggered by approaching the sprite near the Sudowoodo spot.
- Final Encounter: Tin Tower. Stationary battle.

## Route 42 Navigation
- Middle Island access: Surf at (14, 12) or use Cut on the tree at (24, 13).
- Note: The Cut tree regrows whenever the map is reloaded (e.g., entering or exiting Mount Mortar).

## Party Strategy
- XENON (Gastly, Lv18): Mean Look and Hypnosis. Essential for the final encounter at Tin Tower.
- KIMCHI (Gloom): Has Cut for navigation.

- LEDGE: One-way movement (usually South or East).
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Collision type at (50, 14), impassable from North.
