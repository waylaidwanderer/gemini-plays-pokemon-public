## Gym Progress
- Zephyr Badge: Obtained from Falkner.

## Union Cave 1F Progress
- Explored eastern passage. Found Great Ball at (17, 21).
- Fisher (Trainer) at (14, 19).

## Lessons Learned
- Menu Navigation: The main menu wraps around (8 items). Resetting with 8 presses is ineffective. Use 8 Downs to hit EXIT as a known anchor.
- Battle Lead: Switching in battle updates overworld lead upon victory/escape.

## Strategy: Reaching Azalea Town
1. Navigate south through Union Cave 1F to Azalea Town.
2. Use Calcifer (Quilava) as lead to handle encounters.

## Battle Notes
- Gneiss is out of Rock Throw PP.
- Calcifer is the primary attacker for cave encounters.
- Rocky (Onix) is a backup tank.
