# Suicune Capture Strategy
## The Repel Trick
- **Lead:** KIMCHI (Lv 21 Gloom).
- **Setup:** Super Repel filters wild Pokemon (Lv 13-16). Suicune (Lv 40) is the only possible encounter.
- **Status:** Super Repel active (Used Turn #13578). 0/200 steps.
- **Pacing Area:** Tall grass at (25, 7). Pacing between (24, 7) and (26, 7).

## Battle Strategy (vs Suicune Lv 40)
- **Mechanics:** Suicune has Base Speed 85 and flees on its first active turn.
- **Problem:** KIMCHI (Speed 40) is slower and will act after Suicune flees.
- **Plan:** Use Sleep Powder every encounter. Since HP and status are persistent, we will eventually land a Sleep Powder on a turn Suicune doesn't flee (if it uses a move) or through multiple attempts.
- **Catch Rate:** ~0.39% (Full HP, Great Ball). Increases to ~4.3% when asleep. Verified by suicune_capture_analyst_v2.
- **Contingency:** If no progress after 5 encounters, catch a faster trapper (e.g., Haunter for Mean Look).

## Route 38 Navigation
- **Roamer Logic:** Suicune moves routes ONLY when crossing map boundaries (Route 38/39 edge), using Fly, or after a battle.
- **Current Location:** Verified on Route 38 (Turn #13572).
