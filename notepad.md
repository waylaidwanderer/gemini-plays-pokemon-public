# Game Mechanics & Rules
- **Battle-Warps:** Specific tiles can trigger a wild battle that also teleports the player. Location: Mt. Moon B2F (29, 9) -> B1F (21, 12). HIGHLY UNRELIABLE.
- **Confusion:** Wears off after battle.
- **Defeated Trainers:** Some become impassable obstacles.
- **Elevation Rule:** Movement between `ground` and `elevated_ground` requires a `steps` tile.
- **Item-Gated NPCs:** Some NPCs block paths and require a specific item to let you pass, instead of a battle. Example: Rocket Grunt at Mt. Moon B2F (30, 12) requires a fossil.

# Battle Notes & Movesets
- Electric is ineffective vs. Ground (Geodude, Sandshrew).
- Grass is 4x effective vs. Rock/Ground (Geodude).
- Electric is NOT very effective vs. Bug/Grass (Paras) or Grass/Poison (Oddish, Bellsprout).

# Area Notes & Navigation
- **Mt. Moon B2F:** The northern section is a large side-loop accessed via a ladder on B1F at (26, 10). The main path forward is in the southern part of the floor.

# Defeated Trainers Log
- **Mt. Moon 1F:** Hiker (6, 7), Youngster (8, 23), Lass (17, 25), Super Nerd (25, 30), Lass (31, 7), Youngster (13, 17), Youngster (31, 28)
- **Mt. Moon B2F:** Rocket Grunt (16, 23), Rocket Grunt (30, 8)

# Critical Lessons Learned
- **LESSON 1:** Do not fixate on NPCs as impassable walls. Always check for open paths around them. My assumption that the Rocket at (30, 12) blocked the entire corridor cost me over 50 turns. The path was open to the east the entire time.
- **LESSON 2:** The ladder at (26, 10) on B2F leads to a confirmed dead-end platform on B1F at (18, 12). This path is a loop and MUST be ignored.
- **LESSON 3:** The battle-warp at (29, 9) on Mt. Moon B2F is completely unreliable. After defeating the Zubat, I was not teleported. This is NOT a viable strategy for progression and must be avoided.

# Agent & Tool Notes
- My old `map_analyzer_agent` was fundamentally broken and has been deleted. Do not trust its logic.
- The new `pathfinding_agent` is designed for simple, reliable pathfinding on the current map.
- The `healing_spot_finder_agent` has proven reliable for multi-map pathfinding to Pok√©mon Centers.
