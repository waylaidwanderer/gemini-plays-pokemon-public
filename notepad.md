# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Stop Team Rocket.
- **Secondary Goal:** Investigate Radio Tower (Team Rocket takeover).
- **Navigation:** Navigate North to the Radio Tower.
- **Status:** In Goldenrod City (15, 28).
- **Plan:**
    1. Walk North to the Radio Tower (approx. coordinates (3, 6) or similar).
    2. Assess the situation (blocked stairs, grunts, etc.).
    3. If blocked, investigate the Underground for the Rocket Uniform or Director.

## Reflections & Lessons
- **Fly Mechanic:** Must verify destination text before confirming. Do not batch navigation and confirmation.
- **Map Markers:** Distinguish PC types (Storage vs Research) to avoid confusion.
- **Menu Hygiene:** Ensure menus are fully closed to avoid state desync.
- **Navigation Lesson:** Always verify the path against specific tile data (Mental Map/ASCII) to identify obstacles like Headbutt Trees or Walls before defining a path plan. Straight lines are rarely safe.
