# Strategic Notes

- **Tertiary:** Hunt Roamers (Raikou/Entei) - *Paused*.

## Current Task: Traverse Route 26
- **Location:** Route 26 (Approaching Victory Road Gate).
- **Goal:** Reach Victory Road Gate at (7, 5).
- **Route:** North to Row 8 -> Cross West -> Enter Gate.

## Status
- **Money:** ¥3294 (Gaven Defeated).

- **Party:** Gyarados (Lead), Lugia, Machoke, Pidgey, Oddish, Quilava.

## Tile Mechanics
- **LADDER (Route 27/26):** Functions as walkable bridge.
- **Lesson (Turn 32915):** The system strictly enforces the "no mixing directional and action buttons" rule by truncating inputs. When navigating menus, split directional moves (e.g., "Down") and confirmations (e.g., "A") into separate turns to ensure reliability.
