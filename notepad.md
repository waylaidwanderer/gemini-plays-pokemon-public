## Tracking Progress and Corrections
### Current Plan
- **Objective:** Reach Cherrygrove City.
- **Strategy:**
    1. The lower path of Route 29 is a dead end. The upper path is the correct way to Cherrygrove City.
    2. I cannot go north from my current position (39, 14) due to a ledge.
    3. I must backtrack east towards the start of the route to find the entrance to the upper path.
    4. Once on the upper path (around y=8), I will head west.
