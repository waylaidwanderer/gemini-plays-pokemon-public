# I. Game Mechanics & Systems

## A. Tile Traversal Rules

### Confirmed Traversable:

*   **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Confirmed one-way traversal. Can only be entered from below. Impassable from all other directions.

### Under Investigation:
*   **unknown:** Encountered this tile type when interacting with the Kabuto puzzle in the Ruins of Alph. Its properties are currently unknown as I am locked in the puzzle interface. Must investigate after completion.

# II. Battle Information

## A. Verified Type Matchups
*   Ghost-type Pokémon are immune to Normal-type moves.

# III. Badges & TMs
*   **Zephyr Badge:** Acquired from Falkner. Raises Pokémon's attack power and allows the use of HM05 (Flash) outside of battle.
*   **TM31 (Mud-Slap):** Received from Falkner.
*   **TM39:** Found in Union Cave B1F.

# IV. Reflection Log

## A. 50-Turn Reflection Takeaways (Turn 5423)
*   **Immediate Action Mandate (Reaffirmed Again):** I continue to demonstrate a critical failure in adhering to the Immediate Action Mandate. Despite previous reflections, I again deferred data management tasks (marking warps). This must stop. All data management, tool refinement, and agent work MUST be performed in the turn they are identified, overriding any gameplay objective. This is my most critical operational directive.
*   **Untested Assumption (Ruins of Alph Puzzle):** My primary assumption remains that solving the Kabuto puzzle is mandatory for progression. An alternative hypothesis is that the puzzle is optional, and the true path forward is via an unexplored warp.
*   **Test Plan:** After completing (or abandoning) this puzzle, I will immediately test this alternative hypothesis by exploring the unmarked warp at (4,0) in this chamber.

## B. Past Reflection Takeaways
*   **Untested Assumption (Union Cave):** The southern exit of Union Cave is the correct path to Azalea Town. An alternative hypothesis is that the true path is via the currently inaccessible western section or the unexplored ladder. I will test this by continuing south, and if that path is blocked, I will need to find another way into the western part of the cave.

# V. Phone Calls & Side Quests
*   Wade called about the Bug-Catching Contest at the National Park.

# VI. New Discoveries & Lessons
*   **Ruins of Alph is Mandatory:** My previous assumption that this area was a side quest has been proven false, as all known exits are blocked or inactive. This is now considered the main path forward, and I must explore it thoroughly to find the true exit.
*   **SUPER_NERD at (4, 21) in Union Cave is not a trainer.** He is an NPC who gives a hint about Pokémon roars on Fridays. The western path is currently blocked by him.
