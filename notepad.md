# Suicune Quest (Crystal)
- Current Step: Re-verify Route 42 sighting.
- Route 42 HOW: Surf from Ecruteak side (41, 10), Cut tree at (24, 13), walk to center of island to trigger Suicune fleeing.
- Pivot: If Route 42 is clear, approach Route 36 junction (28, 9) from the West.
- Battle Plan (Tin Tower): Lead with XENON (Gastly). Turn 1: Hypnosis. Turn 2+: Night Shade.

- WALL / HEADBUTT_TREE / FRUIT_TREE / CUT_TREE: Impassable.
- TALL_GRASS: Traversable, triggers encounters.
- WATER: Impassable without Surf.
- LEDGE_HOP / LEDGE: One-way movement (usually South).
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way barrier (Southward).
- WARP / DOOR / WARP_CARPET: Map transition.
- COUNTER: Impassable. Interact from front + A.

# Key Observations
- Suicune Sighting Sequence: Scripted events (Burned Tower -> Cianwood -> Route 42 -> Route 36 -> Tin Tower).
- Pokedex 'Area' shows the next scripted route for Suicune.
- Menu Navigation: Break sequences into 1-2 presses to avoid looping. Verify cursor state.
