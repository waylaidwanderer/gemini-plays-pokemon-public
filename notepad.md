# Strategic Plans
## Locate Suicune (Cianwood North Beach)
- Objective: Reach (7, 4) on the north beach plateau.
- Primary Route: The 'Great Spiral' buoy maze via (27, 30).
- Shortcut Hypothesis: Walking North along the West beach at X=2 may bypass the maze.
- Verification Task: Navigate to (2, 35) and walk North to Y=4.

## Verify 'Gem Shortcut'
- Result: FAILED. Gap at (11, 15) is a dead-end pocket. Marker 🚫 placed.

## The Great Spiral (Maze Logic)
- Entrance: (27, 30).
- Route: Lane 1 (N) -> Lane 2 (S) -> Lane 3 (S) -> Lane 4 (N) -> Lane 5 (N) -> Land at (14, 10).
- Requirements: Surf, Super Repel.
