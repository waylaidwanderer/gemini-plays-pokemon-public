# Pokémon Crystal Journey

## Current Plan
- **Objective:** Return to Professor Elm in New Bark Town with the MYSTERY EGG.
- **Route:** Head south from Route 30, through Cherrygrove City, and west through Route 29 to reach New Bark Town.

## Current Quest
- Bring the MYSTERY EGG to Professor Elm.

## Long-term Goal
- Become the Pokémon League Champion.

## Key Items
- **POKéGEAR:** Received from Mom. Has a Phone feature.
- **POKéDEX:** Received from Professor Oak. Automatically records data on Pokémon.
- **MYSTERY EGG:** Received from Mr. Pokémon. Needs to be taken to Professor Elm.

## Mechanics & Discoveries
### System Mechanics
- **POKéGEAR:** Received from Mom. Has a Phone feature.
- **Warp Mechanics:** Some warp tiles may require stepping off of them and then back on to activate.
### Environmental Mechanics
- **Route 29 Ledges:** The western section of Route 29 has one-way ledges preventing eastward travel from that area.
- **Route 46:** This route is a dead-end when approached from the south due to one-way ledges.
- **CUT_TREE:** These small trees are impassable and require the HM 'Cut' to be removed.
### Battle Mechanics
- **Held Items (Berries):** Some Pokémon can hold items like Berries, which they can use automatically in battle to heal themselves when their HP gets low.
- **Smokescreen:** Lowers the opponent's accuracy.
### Item Effects
- **POTION:** Heals a Pokémon for 20 HP.

## Wild Pokémon Encounters
### Route 29 (Tall Grass)
- **Hoppip** (Lv. 2-3): Knows Splash
- **Sentret** (Lv. 2-3): Knows Tackle
- **Pidgey** (Lv. 2-3): Knows Tackle
- **Rattata** (Lv. 2): Knows Tackle
- **Hoothoot** (Lv. 3): Knows Tackle

## Important NPCs
- **Professor Elm** (New Bark Town): Gave me Hestia and his phone number. Wants to see the MYSTERY EGG.
- **Mom** (New Bark Town): Gave me the POKéGEAR.
- **MR. POKEMON** (Route 30): Gave me the MYSTERY EGG.
- **Professor Oak** (met at Mr. Pokémon's House): Gave me the POKéDEX.

## Radio Broadcasts
- **Professor Oak's Pokémon Talk:** Abra may be seen around Route 35.

## Puzzle Solutions
- **Cherrygrove House Lock:** Became stuck at (3, 1). Solution was to turn to face the TV at (2, 1) and interact with it ('A' button). This triggered a text box, and after closing it, movement was restored.
- **Mr. Pokémon's House Exit:** Became stuck on the exit warp at (2, 7). Solution was to press 'Start' to open the menu, then 'B' to close it, which resolved the glitched state and allowed the warp to function.

## Self-Corrections & Failed Hypotheses
- The path to Cherrygrove City is through Route 29. My initial assumption that it was a dead end was incorrect.
