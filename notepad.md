# Current Status
- Location: Whirl Island Lugia's Chamber (3_73).
- **Lugia Caught!** (Sent to Box 3 presumably, as party is full).
- Current Screen: Pokedex Entry for Lugia.
- Immediate Goal: Nickname Lugia "MAELSTROM", then leave.

# Next Objectives
1. Escape Whirl Islands.
2. Check Lugia in PC.
3. Hunt Roaming Beasts (Raikou, Entei) and Suicune (Tin Tower?).
   - *Correction:* In Crystal, Suicune is at Tin Tower AFTER getting the Clear Bell (which I have). Wait, I fought Suicune at Tin Tower? The summary says "entered the Tin Tower... but failed to capture Suicune."
   - I need to check if I can battle Suicune again or if it's roaming. Usually, if failed (killed?), it's gone. If failed (ran?), it might respawn or be roaming? Or maybe I just didn't catch it.
   - Raikou and Entei are definitely roaming.
   - Ho-Oh requires all 3 beasts caught.

# Post-Game Goals
