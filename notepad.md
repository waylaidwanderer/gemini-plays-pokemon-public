- **Encounter:** Rival Silver encountered in Switch Room Entrances.
- **Dialogue:** He claims my previous victory was a fluke and wants to "repay his debts". Likely a battle.
- **Battle Update:** Silver sent out Haunter. Muscle (Lv 52) staying in to use Dig (Super Effective vs Ghost/Poison).
- **Rival Team:** Golbat (Lv 30), Haunter (Lv ??). Likely includes Sneasel, Magnemite, Croconaw.
- **Battle Update:** Silver sent out Feraligatr. Muscle (Lv 52) staying in.
- **Plan:** Use Cross Chop (Slot 4). It has STAB and high crit rate. Even neutral, it should crush Feraligatr (Lv 32).
- **Battle Update:** Silver sent out Sneasel. Staying in with Muscle.
- **Plan:** Use Cross Chop. Sneasel is Dark/Ice, so Fighting is 4x effective. One hit KO guaranteed.
- **Battle Update:** Silver sending out Magnemite. Staying in with Muscle.
- **Plan:** Use Dig. Magnemite is Electric/Steel, so Ground is 4x effective. Guaranteed OHKO.
- **Battle Result:** Defeated Silver (Muscle swept team).
- **Status:** Exploring the room at Map 3_54 (Southwest section).
- **Location:** Near Teacher at (3, 27).
- **Goal:** Check this room for Switch 2.
- **Observation:** This room connects to the surface (Goldenrod) via the south exit. It might just be an entrance.
- **Plan:** Battle/Talk to Teacher, scan for items/switches. If empty, return to Main Tunnel and search for other paths.
