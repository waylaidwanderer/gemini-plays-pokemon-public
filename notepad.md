# Blackthorn Gym (Global Mechanics)
- Start Turn: 34501
- Pits (2F): P1 (8, 3), P2 (2, 5), P3 (8, 7).
- Boulders (2F): B6 (3, 3), B7 (6, 1), B8 (8, 14).
- Floor Reset: Using a ladder (1, 7) or (7, 9) resets all boulder positions on 2F.
- Push Mechanic: Player stays in the same tile after pushing a boulder.

# Manual Strategy: Blackthorn Gym 2F
- Goal: Fill the three pits on 2F to bridge gaps on 1F.
- Plan:
    1. B8 (8, 14) -> Push UP to (8, 10).
    2. Assess next move for B8 (need to find a gap at x=9 or x=7).
    3. B7 (6, 1) -> P1 (8, 3).
    4. B6 (3, 3) -> P2 (2, 5).

# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Walkable.
- WALL: Impassable collision.
- PIT: Impassable on 2F; fills gap on 1F.
- LADDER: Warp between floors.
- BOULDER: Pushable object (requires Strength).

# Resource Locations
- Route 45: Good training spot for Haunter (Night Shade).
