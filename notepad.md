# Suicune Quest Strategy (Crystal)
- Phase Start: Turn 27180
- Exploration Phase Start: Turn 27390
- Tracking Wild Suicune Phase Start: Turn 27442 (Dec 27, 2025)
- Key Items: Clear Bell (Acquired)
- Prerequisite Strategy: Eusine must be defeated at Cianwood City north shore before wild sightings on Route 42 and 36 will trigger.
- Route 42 Trigger: (26, 15) - Small clearing with 3 Apricorn trees outside Mt. Mortar middle entrance.
- Route 36 Trigger: Target location TBD.
- Final Encounter: Tin Tower (static battle) after all wild sightings.

## Battle Strategy (Wise Trio)
- Trio will only battle after Route 42 and 36 sightings are complete.
- Lead: GNEISS (Graveler) Lv44 (Earthquake, Rollout).

## Capture Strategy (Suicune)
- Suicune is a static encounter in Tin Tower (Crystal). 
- Lead: XENON (Gastly) Lv21 (Hypnosis, Night Shade).
- Items: 43 Great Balls, 1 Ultra Ball.

## Lessons Learned
- Suicune Quest (Crystal): The quest is strictly gated. Eusine must be defeated in Cianwood before the Route 42 sighting triggers.
- Navigation (Cianwood): The northern shore is complex to reach by land due to wall placement.
- Event Verification: If Eusine is missing from the Cianwood beach after Suicune flees, the battle flag is likely set or the event was completed.

## Task Log
- Turn 27474: Started verifying Eusine's defeat in Cianwood.
- Turn 27564: Eusine confirmed missing from shore; proceeding to Route 42.
