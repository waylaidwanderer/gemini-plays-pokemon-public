# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Strategy & Pathing
- **Goal:** Reach Azalea Town (West of Route 33).
- **Current Task:** Defeat Hiker Anthony.
- **Battle Status:** Unakite Fainted. Sending out Rocky (14/28 HP).
- **Strategy:**
    1. Send out Rocky.
    2. **CRITICAL DECISION:**
        - Option A: Attack immediately (Screech/Tackle). Risk: Faint if slower/one-shot.
        - Option B: Heal with Energypowder (50HP). Risk: Take hit while healing.
        - Analysis: Low Kick (50BP, 2x eff) vs Onix Defense. Likely 10-15 dmg. 14 HP is borderline.
        - Plan: Heal immediately if he survives entry? No, clean switch means I get a turn.
        - **Revised Plan:** Use Energypowder on Turn 1. Rocky goes to Full. Takes hit. Then fight.
- **Map Notes:**
    - **Route 32:** North.
    - **Union Cave 1F:** Current. Exit at (17, 31).
    - **Route 33:** South.
- **Mechanics:**
    - **Gen 2 Battle:** **CONFIRMED:** Cannot use healing items on benched Pokémon.
    - **Low Kick:** 50 BP.
