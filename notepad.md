# Completed Missions
- **Radio Tower:** Defeated Team Rocket, rescued Director, got Clear Bell (for Tin Tower).

# Suicune Analysis (The Target)
- **Level:** 40
- **Moves:** Bubblebeam (Water), Gust (Flying, Phys), Leer, Rain Dance.
- **Stats:** High Def/Sp.Def. Fast.
- **Catch Strategy:**
    1.  **Status:** MUST HAVE Sleep (Hypnosis/Sleep Powder) or Paralysis. (Lapis has Hypnosis but is Lv 12).
    2.  **HP:** False Swipe (if available) or careful chipping.
    3.  **Balls:** Great Balls (Stock 3 -> Buy 20+).
    4.  **Tank:** Muscle (Machoke) is good but takes heavy damage from Gust due to low Sp.Def/Def drops? Wait, Gust is Physical in Gen 2. Machoke has decent Def. The Def drops from Leer were the killer. X Defend could counter this.

# Tile Mechanics
- **MART_SHELF:** Impassable. Obstacle.
- **FLOOR:** Traversable. Standard movement.
- **WALL:** Impassable.
- **STAIRCASE/LADDER:** Traversable. Warps to another floor.
- **COUNTER:** Impassable. Interact to talk to NPCs.
- **WARP_CARPET:** Traversable. Exits map.

# Shop Inventories

# Strategy Notes
- **Advisor Plan:** Lead Gyarados -> Dragon Rage x3 (120 dmg) -> Switch to Sleeper (Lapis/Lucid) -> Hypnosis -> Ultra/Great Balls.
- **Team Change:** Swapped Belladonna for Lucid (Drowzee Lv 13). Team is full (6/6).
- **Shopping:** Budget ¥12952. Buying 21 Great Balls (¥12600).
- **Next:** Exit Center -> Mart -> Train Lucid/Lapis on Route 37/38?
- **Tactics:** Equip Quick Claw to Lucid (Drowzee) - DONE.
- **Inventory Update:** Bought 21 Great Balls. Total: 24.
- **Next Step:** Test speed/hypnosis on wild pokemon (Optional). Proceed to Suicune.
- **Action:** Equipping Quick Claw to Lucid (Slot 6).
- **Goal:** Increase Lucid's chance to move first and use Hypnosis on Suicune.
- **Party Order:** Moving Gyarados to Lead (Slot 1) for Dragon Rage strategy.
- **Plan:** Head straight to Tin Tower. No grinding. Relying on Strategy Advisor's Dragon Rage plan.
- **Tactics Update:** Gyarados is Lead (Ready for Dragon Rage). Strategy: Dragon Rage x3 -> Switch to Sleeper.
- **Next:** Walk to Tin Tower (North Ecruteak).
- **Map Analysis:** The Left side (X<=5) seems separated from the Right side (X>=7) by a wall at X=6. Suicune is on the Right side at (9,9). To reach it, I likely need to traverse the southern corridor (Y=11,12,13) to the east, then head North through a gap (possibly at X=14).
- **Plan:** Move South to corridor, head East, then North.
- **Immediate Action:** Moving to safe spot (5,11) and opening menu to Switch Gyarados to Lead.
- **Map Insight:** A wall at Y=10 (X=9-13) blocks direct access to Suicune from the south. Must navigate North along the East side (X=14/15) to bypass the internal wall, likely crossing back West above Row 6.
- **Map Analysis:** Suicune is in a sealed room. Warp at (10,2) is CONFIRMED INACTIVE (walked over it, no effect).
- **Hypothesis:** Speaking to the Sage at (14,6) might activate it or provide a key.
- **Plan:** Talk to the Sage at (14,6).
- **Lore Update:** Sage at (5,9) discusses the legend of the Rainbow Pokémon (Ho-Oh) testing humans. He did not move or battle.
- **Plan Update:** Heading to talk to the Sage at (14,6). Re-testing warp at (10,2) on the way.
- **Lore Update:** Sage at (14,6) spoke about the two towers fostering friendship 700 years ago.
- **Hypothesis:** Talking to both Sages might have unlocked the path or the warp.
- **Plan:** Return to the warp at (10,2) and inspect it. If that fails, check the Left Sage again.
- **Hypothesis Update:** The warp at (10,2) likely leads to 2F, allowing access to the center of 1F via a drop or stairs.
- **Action:** Inspecting (10,2) and re-entering it to trigger the warp.
- **Lore Complete:** Spoke to all three Sages ((5,9), (14,6), (11,11)). They confirmed the legend of the 3 beasts and Ho-Oh.
- **Problem:** Warp at (10,2) did not trigger on first pass.
- **Action:** Stepping off and back onto the warp (Down -> Up) to attempt to trigger it again.
- **Hypothesis:** It works like a teleporter or I experienced a glitch/lag. Re-entry should fix it.
- **Issue:** Warp at (10,2) is inactive despite speaking to all Sages.
- **Hypothesis:** The map state needs to refresh or I need to trigger an event upon entering the map with the "Lore Read" flag set.
- **Action:** Exited to Ecruteak. Re-entering Tin Tower to refresh map state and retry Warp (10,2).
- **Action:** Re-entered Tin Tower 1F. Navigating to (10,2) to retry the warp.
- **Plan:** Go East via Row 13 to avoid obstacles, then North along East wall, then West to (10,2).
