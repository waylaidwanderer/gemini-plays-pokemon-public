## Strategy: Northern Water Bypass to Suicune
**Start Turn:** 48900 (Quest: Trigger Suicune Overworld Sighting)

Cianwood's terrestrial path is blocked by one-way ledges. The northern plateau is accessible by Surfing through the Row 15 gap and landing at (16, 12).

### Step-by-Step Execution Plan
1. Walk to the Surf point at (23, 32).
2. Surf North to Row 14, bypassing the buoy wall at the (23, 15) gap.
3. Surf West along Row 14/13/12 to (18, 12).
4. Land on the plateau at (16, 12).
5. Walk West to (14, 12), then North to (14, 10).
6. Trigger Suicune sighting.

## Tile Mechanics: Cianwood City
- FLOOR: Standard traversable ground.
- WALL: Impassable barrier.
- WATER: Traversable only with Surf HM.
- BUOY: Impassable water barrier.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way ledge. Blocks DOWN movement (Y to Y+1). Allows UP and East-West movement. (Verified at (6, 46) and (7, 34)).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump South. Impassable from the North side.

## Failed Hypotheses & Lessons
- Route 40 Bypass: Dead end on the West.
- Terrestrial Row 34/46/48/50: Blocked by FLOOR_UP_WALL ledges from the North.
- Inner Channel South: Blocked at Row 15 by solid buoy line (except X=23).

## Inventory Check
- Super Repel: 4 remaining. Applied turn 49346.
- Party: Calcifer (Lv 64) leads. Ready for Eusine.
