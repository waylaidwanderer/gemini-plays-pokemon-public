# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Current Task
- **Map 4_5**: Dance Theater Interior.
- **Action**: In the lobby. Moving to the stage to fight the Kimono Girls.
- **Status**: Revive (used), Super Potion (x3) left. Money: ¥10.
- **Correction**: I do NOT have TM28 (Dig). Plan: Rely on Flame Wheel (90 BP with STAB) vs Mud-Slap (40 BP with SE).
- **Next**: Exit Mart -> Kimono Girls (Dance Theater).

- **Kimono Girls Gauntlet**:
  - **Status**: COMPLETED.
  - **Reward**: HM03 (Surf) obtained!
- **Current Task**: Travel to Olivine City.
  - **Route**: Ecruteak City -> West Gate -> Route 38 -> Route 39 -> Olivine City.
  - **Goal**: Help the sick Pokémon (Ampharos) / Challenge Gym.
- **Rocket Grunt**: Interact after clearing the stage.
- **Reflection (Turn 14780)**:
  - **Progress**: Arrived at Dance Theater.
  - **Goal**: Win these battles.
  - **Lesson**: Manual healing was faster than debugging the Joy loop. Adaptability wins.
- **Map 4_5**: Row 4 is a stage ledge. Access via stairs at x=1 and x=10.
- **Reflection (Turn 14832)**:
  - **Status**: Battling Espeon. Used Smokescreen (Slot 3) by accident (meant Flame Wheel).
  - **Plan**: Switch to Flame Wheel (Slot 4).
  - **Hygiene**: Notepad and markers are clean.
  - **Goal**: Clear the theater, get Surf.
- **Correction**: Blocked by Kuni at (9,1). Rerouting to (11,2).
- **Reflection (Turn 14884)**:
  - **Mechanic**: Battle Move List is vertical (1 column), not 2x2 grid. Manual navigation required to ensure correct selection.
  - **Critical**: Out of Ground-type PP (Dig/Mud-Slap). Must brute-force Naoko with Flame Wheel.
  - **Status**: Garnet is strong enough (Lv 34 vs 17) to ignore resistance.
- **Tool Warning**: `battle_select_move` assumes 2x2 grid layout. Gen 2 uses a vertical list. Do NOT use this tool; navigate moves manually.
- **Battle Note**: Check if cursor remembers last move position in Gen 2.
- **Logistics**: Garnet has Dig (0 PP). Notepad was incorrect about not having it. Healing now to restore PP.
- **Map Note**: 4_3 is Ecruteak PC.
- **Current Task**: Heal -> Check PP -> Head to Route 38 (West Gate).
- **Map Note**: There is a building at (22-25, 24-25) between the Dance Theater and Pokémon Center. Must navigate around it.
- **Correction**: Nurse Joy interaction failed at (5, 3). Trying alignment at (4, 3) (centered with door).
