# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Verified Strategy: The Western Bypass
The northern plateau (14, 10) is accessible via a pure land route that bypasses the central walls and ledges by looping through the western section of the city.

### Execution Plan
1. Western Loop: Walk South to Row 38, then West through the gap at (9, 38). (In Progress)
2. Western Ascent: Walk North along Column 2 (or adjacent clear rows) to Row 14.
3. Plateau Entry: Walk East along Row 14 to (8, 14) and North to Row 12.
4. Final Approach: Walk East along Row 12 to (14, 12) and North to Suicune at (14, 10).

### Key Transition Points
- (9, 38): Gap between walls at the central land mass.
- (4, 30), (4, 20): FLOOR_UP_WALL tiles (One-way North) that allow access to upper terraces.
- (11, 15): Gap in the ledge system (FLOOR tile) at Column 11.
- (8, 14) -> (8, 13) -> (8, 12): Gap in the northern walls.

## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard land (Traversable).
- WATER: Water (Requires Surf).
- WALL: Impassable.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way North (e.g., (6, 46), (4, 30), (4, 20)).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way South (e.g., (10, 15)).

## Battle Plan: Eusine
- Expected Team: Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25).
- Lead: Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion). Strategy: Sweep with Flamethrower.
