# Strategy: The Suicune Pursuit
- **Objective:** Trigger Suicune sighting at (14, 10) in northern Cianwood.
- **Eusine Battle Prep:** Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25). Strategy: Lead with Lv64 Calcifer. Sweep with Flamethrower/Thunderpunch.
- **Current Plan (The Sea Bypass):**
  1. Move East to (27, 44).
  2. Surf at (28, 44).
  3. Surf North to Row 7, then West through the buoy gap at (22, 7).
  4. Surf South to Row 10, then West to land at (15, 10).
  5. Walk to (14, 10) for the sighting.
- **Verification:** Buoy gap at (22, 7) confirmed. Landing spot (15, 10) confirmed FLOOR.

# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Standard traversable terrain.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable terrain.
- WATER: Traversable only with Surf.
- DOOR / WARP_CARPET: Map transition points.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump down (South). Blocks North.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL (Terrace Climb): One-way barrier. Allows North movement, blocks South.
- ROCK (Object): Blocks movement; cleared with Rock Smash. Respawns upon map transition.

# Area Notes: Cianwood City
- **Barriers:** Row 15 is a solid wall/buoy barrier from X=3 to X=22, EXCEPT for a gap at (11, 15). Row 13 is solid at X=11, making (11, 15) a dead end.
- **Shortcut Tiles:** (5, 29), (4, 25) (Smashed Rocks).
- **Terrace Climbs:** (4, 30), (6, 34), (6, 46), (21, 46), (8, 48), (12, 50). All block South movement.

# Lessons Learned
- **Time Check:** Attempting sighting since Turn #50620.
- **Verification:** X=2 corridor confirmed clear of Terrace Climbs and Ledges in Mental Map.
