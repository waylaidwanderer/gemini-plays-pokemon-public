# Strategic Notes
## Objectives
- **Primary:** Reach Indigo Plateau (Money Farming Loop).
- **Secondary:** Defeat Elite Four.
- **Tertiary:** Hunt Roamers (Raikou/Entei) - *Paused*.

## Current Task: Prepare for Elite Four
- **Location:** Indigo Plateau (ID: 16_2).
- **Goal:** Heal party and buy supplies.
- **Steps:**
  1. Heal at Nurse Joy (3, 9).
  2. Buy Full Restores/Revives at Mart (11, 9).
  3. Deposit unnecessary items/Pokemon if needed (PC at 7, 7).
  4. Save game (internal mental check).
  5. Challenge Elite Four.

## Reflection (Turn 33015)
- **Achievement:** Successfully crossed Victory Road and reached Indigo Plateau!
- **State:** Party is battered but alive. Money is low (¥3294), need to manage funds carefully.
- **Strategy:** Priority is healing. Then checking prices. Might need to farm money?
  - *Wait*, I can't easily farm money here without going back.
  - I'll rely on my current supplies and skill.
  - Actually, if I lose to E4, I keep experience but lose money.
  - **Grinding Strategy:** Use E4 runs for XP and money? No, I lose money.
  - Better to spend all money on items first, then run E4 for XP/Money (net zero loss if broke).

## Status
- **Money:** ¥3294.
- **Party:** Gyarados (Lead), Lugia, Machoke, Pidgey, Oddish, Quilava.
