# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement (acting as a ledge). Passable from SOUTH to NORTH.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at Row 15 (X=3-17).
- ROCK: Smashable rocks act as WALLs.
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- Started: Turn 49630
## Strategy: Sea Route Bypass (Final)
Reach (14, 10) by surfing around the city via the eastern gap.
1. Move to (23, 33) via Row 32 (avoiding Pokefan at 17, 33).
2. SURF and move to (27, 33).
3. Surf North along X=27 to (27, 8) (Gap in Row 9 buoy wall).
4. Surf West along Row 8 to (14, 8).
5. Move South to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

# Progress Notes
- Blocked: All land routes (X=2, 4, 6, 10, 12) are blocked by internal walls or SOUTH-blocking ledges.
- Verified: (27, 9) is a clear gap in the buoy walls leading to the Northern Sea.
- Verified: Row 8 is a clear horizontal path from X=27 to X=14.
- Verified: Row 32 is a clear horizontal path from X=12 to X=23.
- Hypothesis: Sea route is the only viable path to the northern plateau.
