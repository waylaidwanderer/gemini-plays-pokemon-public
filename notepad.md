- Precise menu navigation is critical; verify menu state before long sequences.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL tiles block movement North (Up) AND block entry from the North (Down).
- Silver Cave Outside has only two main warps (Poke Center and Room 1 entrance).
- Mt. Silver Room 1 has an isolated entrance area; the rest of the room must be accessed via Room 2 or another unknown path.
