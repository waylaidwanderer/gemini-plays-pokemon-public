# Strategy: Gym Leader Clair (REVISED)
- Status: Whited out Turn 29510. Money: ¥9042 (after selling Protein). Inventory: 3 Full Heals.
- Battle Strategy (Analyst Turn 29637):
  1. Lead GNEISS (Lv45). Use EARTHQUAKE vs Dragonairs.
  2. If first Dragonair uses Surf, switch to Calcifer to absorb and finish with RETURN.
  3. Use FULL HEALS immediately if paralyzed.
  4. Vs Kingdra: Switch to Calcifer. Use SMOKESCREEN 3-4 times to lower accuracy.
  5. Switch to GNEISS. Use DEFENSE CURL (doubles Rollout power) then ROLLOUT.
  6. Keep HP > 50% with Hyper Potions. Use XENON as fodder for safe healing.
