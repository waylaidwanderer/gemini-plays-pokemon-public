# I. Core Principles & Lessons Learned
- **System Validation is Absolute Truth:** The game's validation data (e.g., reachable warps) is the ultimate source of truth. If my tools or understanding contradict this data, my tools/understanding are wrong and must be corrected immediately. I will not proceed with actions based on faulty assumptions.
- **Rigorous Hypothesis Testing:** When faced with a puzzle, I will form a single, testable hypothesis and design a minimal experiment to confirm or deny it. I will not assume hidden mechanics like secret passages unless all other possibilities, especially tool failure, have been disproven through systematic debugging.
- **Tool Integrity is Paramount:** A faulty tool is worse than no tool. If a tool provides an incorrect result (e.g., `pathfinder` failing to find a confirmed reachable warp), debugging and fixing that tool becomes my absolute highest priority, superseding any navigational or puzzle-solving goal.

# II. Game Intel
## A. Confirmed ROM Hack Mechanics
- **Type Matchups:** Psychic > Ghost/Poison; Ghost > Psychic; Electric > Rock/Water; CUT (Normal) > VICTREEBEL (Grass/Poison); Flying > Grass/Poison; Psychic > Flying; Ice > Ground; Ground > Poison; Ground > Fire; Rock > Fire.
- **Type Resistances:** Normal !> Psychic; Electric !> Grass; Rock !> Ground; Psychic !> Psychic; Bite (Normal) !> HAUNTER (Ghost/Poison); Ice !> Gyarados (Water/Flying); Poison !> Poison; Ice !> Water; Poison !> Ground.
- **Type Immunities:** Flying immune to Ground; Ground immune to Electric; MUK immune to Poison; HYPNO immune to STUN SPORE; MUK immune to THUNDER WAVE; MAROWAK immune to POISON GAS.
- **Field/Battle Rules:** Switches require standing below and facing up. Losing in a gym does not warp you out. FLY can end wild battles indoors. ROAR can end wild battles.

# III. Puzzle Logs & Hypotheses
## A. Pokémon Mansion Multi-Floor Switch Puzzle
- **Hypothesis (Confirmed):** The switch at (3, 6) on 1F and the switch at (3, 12) on 2F work together to control the gates on 1F.
- **Test:** Activated both switches in sequence.
- **Outcome:** Confirmed. The gates at (17, 8) and (18, 8) on 1F opened, granting access to the eastern section of the floor.

## B. Pokémon Mansion 1F Eastern Section
- **Goal:** Explore the newly accessed eastern section of Pokemon Mansion 1F to find the Secret Key.
- **Current Step:** Navigate to the Scientist at (18, 18) to see if they have any information.
