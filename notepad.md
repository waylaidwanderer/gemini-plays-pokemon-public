- **Tertiary Goal:** Train Party to Level 30+.

## Quest: Deliver Kenya (Route 31)
- **Status:** Finalizing Mail "DARK CAVE".
- **Mail Content Plan:** "DARK CAVE" (Exact sign text).
- **Current State:** Cursor on 'D'. Text is "DARK CAV".
- **Next Steps:**
    1. Move Right to 'E' and Select.
    2. Move Down/Right to 'END' and Confirm.
    3. Exit Menu and Deliver.

## Knowledge Base
- **Fisher (Route 31):** Rejected "DARK CAVE leads to another road." (All Caps).
- **Wade (Route 31):** Called (Turn 9576). Waiting on Route 31.
- **Dark Cave:** Connects Route 31, 45, 46. Needs Flash.

## Mechanics Log
- **Mail:** Prevents deposit. PC Full -> Mail goes to Bag. Must hold nothing to attach.
- **Inputs:** Pressing Start in Mail menu triggers Printer Error. Use B.
- **Lesson:** Pressing 'Start' in the Mail menu causes a "Printer Error" loop or crash behavior. Use 'B' to exit or 'END' to finish.
- **Correction:** Turn 9724 - Accidental menu navigation occurred in Turn 9723 due to premature closure of Mail interface. Message is likely "DARK CAV".
- **Action:** Taking Mail from Kenya to fix the typo.
