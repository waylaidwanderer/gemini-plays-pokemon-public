# Week Siblings Strategy
- Arthur (Thursday): Route 36 (47, 5). Provides Hard Stone. [Urgent - Thursday 10:47 PM]
- Arthur Status: Dialogue is looping intro (Turns 21801-21813). Troubleshooter suggests flag is set. No party members are holding items (Verified Turn 21815). Will check PC.
- Suicune Hunt Sighting 3 Attempt (Route 42 Island): Swept all floor tiles in the grove (Turns 21733-21741). Flee event did not trigger.
- Suicune Hunt Strategy: Tracker says Sighting 3 is Route 42, Sighting 4 is Route 36 (Sudowoodo spot). Checking (35, 9) now.
- Primary Goal HOW: Complete all 5 sightings. Enter Tin Tower 1F. Use Xenon (Gastly) for Hypnosis and Mean Look. Use Ultra/Great Balls.
- Rising Badge (Clair): Next Gym Badge required. Need to travel to Blackthorn City.
- Note: Arthur's position is dynamic. He was seen at (47, 5) on Turn 21811.
- Session Start: Turn 21792 (Thursday 10:39 PM).
- Lesson: Moving NPCs like Arthur can be difficult to interact with. Use `stun_npc` to freeze them in place before attempting to talk.
- Lesson: Never mix directional inputs and the A button in the same turn; the system will strip the A button to prevent errors. Move first, then interact in a separate turn.
- Hypothesis: The Pokedex status "Route 38" refers to Raikou/Entei, not Suicune.
