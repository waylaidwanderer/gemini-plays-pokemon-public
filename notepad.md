# Strategy: Trigger Suicune Sighting
- Plan: The Northern Surf Route.
- Steps:
  1. Surf East to (27, 10).
  2. Surf North to (27, 8).
  3. Surf West to (19, 8).
  4. Surf South to (19, 11).
  5. Surf West to reach land at (16, 11) or (15, 11).
  6. Walk to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.
- Battle Prep: Lead Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion).
- Note: This route bypasses the buoy walls at Row 9 (Cols 22-26) and Column 19 (Rows 15-20).

# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard traversable tile.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable collision.
- WATER: Requires SURF.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (South). Blocks North.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way climb slope. Approach from South (Up move) to climb. Impassable from North (Acts as WALL).
- BREAKABLE ROCK: Requires ROCK SMASH.

# Failed Hypotheses
- Direct City Path: Blocked by northern wall (Row 13/15).
- Western Bypass: Blocked by one-way slopes (Row 16/20/30).
- Great Southern Loop: Blocked by one-way slopes (Row 48/50).
- Row 9 direct crossing: Blocked by buoy wall (Cols 22-26).
- Column 24 North: Blocked by buoy at (24, 9).

# Time Tracking
- Goal: Trigger Suicune sighting in Cianwood.
- Started: Turn 51530.
- Current: Turn 51571.
