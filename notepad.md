# Hall of Fame Entry
- **Achievement:** **CHAMPION OF THE JOHTO LEAGUE!**
- **Date:** Turn 33314
- **MVP:** Muscle (Machoke) Lv88.

# Reflection (Turn 35512)
- **Hygiene:** Fly Map navigation requires visual confirmation or strict timing (sleeps). "Macro" inputs fail due to menu fade-ins.
- **Goal:** Confirmed Ecruteak Mart lacks Repels. Pivot to Goldenrod Dept Store is necessary.
- **Status:** Turn 35529 - Walking on Route 36 to Gatehouse (18, 8). Destination: Goldenrod Dept Store for Super Repels.
- **Strategy:** Once at Goldenrod, buy Super Repels, then Fly to random location to check Roamers.

# Roamer Hunt Log
- **Session Start:** Turn 34090.
- **Goal:** Encounter Raikou/Entei on Route 37.
- **Strategy:** Hunt Roamers on Route 38 (Current loc: R38/R42).
- **Party:** Gyarados (Lv36) w/ Repel.
- **Status:** Turn 35529 - Walking on Route 36 to Gatehouse (18, 8). Destination: Goldenrod Dept Store for Super Repels.

# Lessons Learned
- **Menu Navigation:** Fly Map inputs must be paced (e.g., `sleep 500`). Fast inputs are ignored during transitions.
- **Static Roamers:** Border hopping failed. Randomization via Fly is the current hypothesis.
- **Mart Stock:** Ecruteak Mart does NOT sell Repels. Stock varies by city.
