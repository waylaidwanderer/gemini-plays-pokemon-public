# Strategic Notes
## Objectives
- **Primary:** Reach Indigo Plateau (Money Farming Loop).
- **Secondary:** Defeat Elite Four.
- **Tertiary:** Hunt Roamers (Raikou/Entei) - *Paused*.

## Current Task: Traverse Victory Road 1F (Southeast)
- **Location:** Victory Road 1F (South Section).
- **Goal:** Reach Ladder at (17, 33).
- **Route:** `(1, 49)` -> South to `(2, 56)` -> East to `(18, 56)` -> North to `(18, 53)` -> `(17, 33)`.
- **Reasoning:** Col 17 is a wall from Row 34 to 55. The only gap is at Row 56. Previous attempts failed because I tried to cross North at Col 11-16, which is blocked by Ledges (`FLOOR_UP_WALL`).

## Status
- **Money:** ¥3294.
- **Party:** Gyarados (Lead), Lugia, Machoke, Pidgey, Oddish, Quilava.
