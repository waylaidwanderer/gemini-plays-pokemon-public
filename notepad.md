### Strategic Reflection (Turn 8719)
- **Status**: Stuck in Goldenrod for ~100 turns.
- **Issue**: Oscillating between East/West without clearing the "fog of war".
- **Insight**: The North-East (Flower Shop) is a cul-de-sac. The Central North Wall seems solid. The only remaining option is the North-West quadrant, which is largely "unseen".
- **Action Plan**: 
    1. Return to Main Street (y=10).
    2. Move West to x=6.
    3.Systematically explore North from there, hugging the West edge.

### Navigation Notes
- **Location**: Goldenrod City (West of Radio Tower).
- **Goal**: Follow West Corridor (x=3) North to Route 35.
- **Status**: Finishing Joey's call at (3, 16).
- **Action**: Heading North along the x=3 line.
- **Observation**: This path bypasses the NPC and the Radio Tower.
- **Hypothesis**: This corridor leads directly to the Route 35 Gatehouse (or a transition).

### Quest Chain: SquirtBottle
1. **Defeat Whitney**: Done (Plain Badge obtained).
2. **Find Floria**: Currently seeking at Route 36.
3. **Get Bottle**: Return to Flower Shop after meeting Floria.

### Key Locations
- **NPC Block**: (4, 16) [Bypassed].
- **Current Path**: x=3.
- **Radio Tower**: (5, 15).
