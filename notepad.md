# Gem's Gameplay Log & Strategies

## 1. Game Mechanics & Lessons Learned
*   **Source of Truth:** The `Map Sprites` list is the definitive source for interactable items.
*   **NPC Interaction:** Repeatedly talking to an NPC with static dialogue is a waste of time. Some key events are triggered by advancing through ALL of an NPC's dialogue.
*   **Poison Damage:** Poisoned Pokémon lose 1 HP every four steps.
*   **Warp Mechanics:** It's possible to move between 'ground' and 'elevated_ground' tiles if one of the tiles is a warp.
*   **Mobile NPCs:** For evasive NPCs that move around, use the `stun_npc` tool to freeze them in place before attempting to interact or battle. Chasing them is inefficient.
*   **Defeated Trainers as Obstacles:** This is NOT a universal rule. While the Rocket Grunt on Mt. Moon B2F at (16, 23) became a permanent blocker, other defeated trainers are passable. Must be verified on a case-by-case basis.

## 2. Battle & Pokémon Intel
*   **Battle Tactics:** Ground-types appear to be immune to the poison status effect. Low accuracy moves should be avoided.
*   **Type Weaknesses (Verified):
    *   Zubat (Poison/Flying): Weak to Electric, Ice, Psychic, Rock.
    *   Geodude (Rock/Ground): 4x weak to Grass/Water.
    *   Sandshrew (Ground): Weak to Water, Grass, Ice. Immune to Poison status.
    *   Paras (Bug/Grass): 4x weak to Fire/Flying.

## 3. Area Notes
### Route 4 (ID: 15)
*   The Cool Trainer F is extremely mobile. Attempting to battle her near (7, 6) or (8, 5) can trigger what appears to be a bugged phantom encounter.

## 4. Custom Agent Log
*   **Pathfinding Agent:** Unreliable in complex, multi-level dungeons like Mt. Moon. Its pathing logic does not handle verticality well and can lead to inefficient routes or loops. Manual navigation or the `dungeon_navigator_agent` should be used instead in these areas.
*   **npc_movement_predictor_agent:** Created to predict the movement patterns of mobile NPCs, helping to intercept them for battles or interactions.
*   **systematic_explorer_agent:** Its traversal logic is flawed in Mt. Moon and cannot be trusted. It has failed by generating paths into impassable walls. Requires refinement.

## 5. Lessons from Critiques
*   **Abandon Failing Objectives:** If an objective (especially an optional one) proves unproductive after a few well-documented attempts, disengage immediately. The primary goal of progression is paramount.
*   **Systematic Navigation:** When navigating complex dungeons, avoid trying to force shortcuts. Adopt a methodical exploration pattern (like wall-following) to prevent getting lost in loops.
*   **Agent Refinement:** A failing agent should be refined immediately rather than being used again without changes. Note failures and then fix them.
