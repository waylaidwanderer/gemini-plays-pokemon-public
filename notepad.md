# Active Strategy: The Suicune Pursuit
- **Immediate Goal:** Trigger Suicune sighting at (14, 10) in northern Cianwood.
- **Battle Prep:** Lead with Lv64 Calcifer to sweep Eusine's team (Drowzee, Haunter, Electrode).
- **Plan (The X=2 Expressway):**
  1. Currently surfing at (29, 29). Move West to (15, 29) and land.
  2. Walk West to (6, 29), then through smashed rock (5, 29) to (4, 29).
  3. Walk West to (2, 29) to enter the X=2 corridor.
  4. Walk North to (2, 10) (This corridor is clear of all one-way barriers).
  5. Walk East to (14, 10) for the sighting.
- **Contingency:** If X=2 is blocked, use Surf to (15, 10) from the northern bay (requires finding a buoy gap).

# Progress Tracking
- **Sighting Start:** Turn #50620.
- **Acquired:** Rock Smash (taught to GNEISS).
- **Smashed Rocks:** (5, 29), (4, 25), (8, 16), (9, 17). Verified as FLOOR.

# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard traversable terrain.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable terrain.
- WATER: Traversable only with Surf.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump DOWN (South). Blocks North.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL (Terrace Climb): One-way jump UP (North). Blocks South.
- ROCK (Object): Blocks movement; cleared with Rock Smash.

# Area Notes: Cianwood City
- **Dead Ends:** (11, 15) is a pocket blocked by WALL at (11, 13) and (12, 14).
- **Barrier:** Row 46-50 is a wall of cliffs. Only gaps are at (18, 46) and (6, 50).
- **Navigation:** X=2 and X=4 are the only corridors that reach Row 10 from the south. X=4 is blocked by a wall at (4, 23). X=2 is clear.
