# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Active Strategy: The Western Corridor Sprint
The northern plateau (14, 10) is only accessible via the Western Corridor (X=0-2), which can be entered from the southern clearway (Row 51-53).

1. Land at (23, 32). (In Progress)
2. Walk West along Row 32 to (12, 32).
3. Walk South along X=12 to (12, 49).
4. Walk to (11, 51) via the gap in the Row 50 ledges (11, 50).
5. Walk West along Row 51 to (2, 51).
6. Walk North through the Western Corridor (X=0-2) to Row 12.
7. Walk East along Row 12 to (14, 12), then North to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

## Verified Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement (Confirmed at Row 46, X=28 and Row 50, X=12).
- Row 50 Gap: (11, 50) and (10, 50) are FLOOR, allowing passage to the southern clearway.
- Western Corridor: X=0-2 is clear of ledges from Row 51 to the northern plateau.
