# Agent Improvement Plan
- **Core Priority:** Agent refinement is a top priority. I must immediately use `define_agent` to fix flaws, especially regarding navigation on maps with verticality (`elevated_ground`, `steps`).

# Battle Notes
- Electric is ineffective vs. Ground (Geodude, Sandshrew).
- Grass is 4x effective vs. Rock/Ground (Geodude).
- Electric is NOT very effective vs. Bug/Grass (Paras), or Grass/Poison (Oddish, Bellsprout).

# Dungeon Notes & Traps
- **Mt. Moon 1F:** The ladder at (26, 16) leads to a different part of 1F. It's a tricky path, but not an inescapable trap.
- **Mt. Moon B1F:** The ladder at (18, 12) leads up from B2F. I must explore other routes to progress downwards.

# Game Mechanics
- **Dialogue:** A single 'A' press advances to the next dialogue box. 'B' can dismiss dialogue.
- **Defeated Trainers:** Some defeated trainers act as impassable obstacles.
- **Elevation Rule:** Direct movement between adjacent 'ground' and 'elevated_ground' tiles is possible. This is a key navigation mechanic.
