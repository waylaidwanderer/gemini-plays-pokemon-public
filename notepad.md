- Boulders: B6 (3, 3), B7 (6, 1), B8 (8, 13)
- Status: Strength ACTIVE (Turn 34932)

## Tile Mechanics (2F)
- Vertical Barriers: Column 4 (Row 0-12), Column 2 (Row 10-17), Column 9 (Row 12-17, WALL at 9,13).
- Navigation Gaps: (4, 13) connects left/right, (5, 4) is a vertical corridor.
- Column 8: Blocked by WALLs at (8, 8-9) (Confirmed).
- Column 5: WALL at (5, 10) (Confirmed).

## Puzzle Plan
- Goal: Push B8 to (8, 10) and search for a horizontal exit.
- Hypothesis: One of the walls in Column 7 or 9 is actually FLOOR, allowing B8 to bypass the (8, 8-9) barrier.
- Step 1: Push B8 Up to (8, 10) and attempt to push Left/Right at each step.
- Step 2: If B8 is truly trapped, reset puzzle and use B7 for P1/P3.
