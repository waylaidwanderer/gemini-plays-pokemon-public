# Kanto Campaign Status
- **Location:** Cerulean Pokemon Center.
- **Current Objective:** Reach the Power Plant via Route 9.
- **Immediate Task:** Exit the house and head to Cerulean Gym (30, 23).
- **Observation:** The house was a dead end. The tree at (33, 24) is uncuttable.
- **Hypothesis:** I need to investigate the Gym to trigger the Power Plant quest (find the Rocket Grunt/Machine Part) or find the path to Route 9 through the Gym area.
- **Lore:** In GSC, the Rocket Grunt hides in the Gym.

# Strategic Goals
1. **Restore Power:**
   - Investigate Power Plant (East of Cerulean, end of Route 9).
   - Fix the Generator (likely requires a part).
2. **Wake Snorlax:**
   - Requires Poke Flute functionality (Radio expansion card?).
   - Requires Power restored.
3. **Collect Kanto Badges:**
   - [x] Vermilion (Thunder)
   - [x] Saffron (Marsh)
   - [ ] Cerulean (Cascade) - Misty?
   - [ ] Celadon (Rainbow)
   - [ ] Fuchsia (Soul)
