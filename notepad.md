### Strategic Reflection (Turn 8719)
- **Status**: Stuck in Goldenrod for ~100 turns.
- **Issue**: Oscillating between East/West without clearing the "fog of war".
- **Insight**: The North-East (Flower Shop) is a cul-de-sac. The Central North Wall seems solid. The only remaining option is the North-West quadrant, which is largely "unseen".
- **Action Plan**: 
    1. Return to Main Street (y=10).
    2. Move West to x=6.
    3.Systematically explore North from there, hugging the West edge.

### Navigation Notes
- **Location**: Goldenrod City (West Corridor).
- **Goal**: Reach Route 35 Gatehouse (North Exit).
- **Status**: Successfully bypassed the blocking NPC. Moving North along the narrow path at x=3.
- **Observation**: This corridor is 1 tile wide (bordered by walls at x=2 and x=4).
- **Plan**: Continue North to the map edge or until the path opens up.

### Quest Chain: SquirtBottle
1. **Defeat Whitney**: Done (Plain Badge obtained).
2. **Find Floria**: Currently seeking at Route 36.
3. **Get Bottle**: Return to Flower Shop after meeting Floria.

### Key Locations
- **Current Path**: x=3 corridor.
- **Radio Tower**: (5, 15).
- **Potential Exit**: (3, 0) or (4, 0).
- **Tile Anomaly**: Tile `TYPE_2889` appears to be used for both "Yellow Path" and "Visual Walls".
- **Dead End Confirmed**: (3, 15) is blocked to the North. The corridor at x=3 (y=15-18) is a dead end.
- **Hypothesis**: The Route 35 Exit is likely at the North end of Main Street (x=18), possibly the "Wall" at (18, 1) is a gatehouse entrance.
- Navigation Update: The alley at x=4 is a dead end (fence at y=19). x=3 is a wall. Must backtrack North to y=10 to exit.
- Navigation Update: Tracks at (6, 15) are solid. No direct North path here.
- Plan: Return to Main Street (x=18). Check if Officer at (18, 10) is blocking. If yes, use Underground (Entrance at 11, 29 or 5, 25) to bypass.
