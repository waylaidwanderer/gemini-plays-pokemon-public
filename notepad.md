# Ice Path Strategy
- **Current Action:** Navigating East-Central Winding Path.
- **Goal:** Follow the corridor West via Row 14 to find a Ladder to B1F.
- **Reasoning:**
  - Direct South from (26, 12) is blocked by wall at (26, 13).
  - Must detour East to (27, 12) -> South to (27, 14) to bypass wall.
  - Path continues West along Row 14.
- **Items:** Item Balls at (32, 23), (35, 9), (31, 7).

# Mechanics & Lessons
- **Ice Physics:** Sliding continues until collision.
- **Ledges:** `FLOOR_UP_WALL` tiles are impassable walls from South.

# Map Structure
- **West:** Entrance (Route 44).
- **Center:** Hub.
- **East:** Winding corridors leading deeper.
