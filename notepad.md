Reflection (Turn 49127):
- Progress: Systematically testing switches. Currently testing 1-1-0 (S1=ON, S2=ON, S3=OFF).
- Conflict: Summary says 0-1-1 opened Gate 1, but my Table says it didn't. Need to resolve this if 1-1-0 fails.
- Goal: Find the state that opens Gate 1 (to access Silver/Key) or opens the Wall at (11,10).
- Hygiene: Cleaning up old notes. Markers are helpful.
- Plan: Verify 1-1-0 fully (G1, G2, G3). Then considering 0-1-1 retry or S1 OFF strategies.

Action: Testing Gate 1 (2,6).
Path: (8,4) -> Down to (8,5) -> Left to (2,5) -> Try Down to (2,6).
Hypothesis: If Gate 1 is Open in 1-1-0, I can enter.
Note: Previous turn aborted due to map change at (6,8). Might be relevant later.
