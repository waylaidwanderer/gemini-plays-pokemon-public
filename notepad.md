# Gem's Playbook v4

## Current Objective & Plan
- **Primary Goal:** Defeat Misty, get Cascade Badge.
- **Secondary Goal:** Heal the party at the Pewter City Pokémon Center.
- **Tertiary Goal:** Train lower-level Pokémon.
- **Current Plan:** Navigate to the Pewter City Pokémon Center to heal the party. All exploration is on hold until the team is fully recovered.

## Key Learnings & Tactics
- **Recklessness = Failure.** Do not engage in battles with a weakened party. Heal first.
- **Retreat is a valid strategy.** Blacking out is inefficient.
- **Preparation is key.** Check party health and lead with a strategic advantage.
- **One-way ledges are traps.** Do not jump down a ledge unless the area below has been fully explored and confirmed to have an exit. My predicament on Route 3 was a direct result of violating this rule.
- **Defeated trainers are solid walls.** Plan routes around them.
