# Reflection (Turn 28561)
- **Execution:** Successfully healed up.
- **Error:** Miscounted 'B' presses when navigating Start Menu, accidentally closing it instead of backing up one level.
- **Lesson:** The Start Menu is the root menu level. Pressing 'B' there closes the menu entirely. Verify menu depth before canceling.
- **Strategy:** To find Raikou/Entei, use Pokedex -> Search/Scroll -> Check Area.
