# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard ground. Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Surf required. Traversable.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- DOOR: Warp point.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable cliff face (e.g., Row 15, Row 30, Row 34).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
- BREAKABLE ROCK: Requires Rock Smash. Impassable.
- NPC: Impassable. Interact from adjacent tile.

# Blocked Routes (Verified)
- West Beach (X=0-2): Clear path from Row 36 up to Row 14 plateau.
- Central City: Blocked at Row 30 by a continuous cliff face.
- Buoy Maze Outer: Blocked at X=22 and X=26 by solid buoy walls.

# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The Great Northern Buoy Loop
- Plan:
  1. Use Super Repel in PACK. [DONE]
  2. Navigate to (21, 6) (Gateway through X=26 and X=22 walls). [IN PROGRESS]
  3. Navigate West to (19, 6).
  4. Navigate South to (19, 11), then West to land at (16, 11).
  5. Walk to (14, 10).
- Status: At (27, 18) surfing.
- Reasoning: Multiple buoy walls (X=26, X=22, X=19) create a maze. Row 6 provides the only confirmed gap through the X=22 barrier.
