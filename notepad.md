# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Location:** Silver Cave Outside (SE Area).
- **Status:** Navigating to Water.
- **Action:** Move to (24, 28) to access the water.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. I am at the SE exit (39, 31). The direct path North is blocked by "Ledge Down" tiles.
  2. The Cut Tree at (34, 23) is likely only accessible from the North side (one-way shortcut).
  3. The return path to the main area (PC/Cave) requires Surfing.
  4. I will travel West along the bottom area (Row 34) to reach the water's edge at (24, 28).
  5. Then I will Surf North to reach the Pokemon Center.
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Heal at PC.
  2. Explore North-West of Silver Cave Outside for a path to the Route 28 House.
