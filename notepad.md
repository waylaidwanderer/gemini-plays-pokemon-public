## Strategy: Northern Landing via Row 11 Bypass
**Start Turn:** 48900 (Quest: Trigger Suicune Overworld Sighting)

Cianwood's buoy walls are bypassed! I am in the X=20 channel.
The Northern Plateau is accessible by Surfing to the Row 15 gap and then looping around the X=19 wall at Row 14.

### Execution Plan
1. Apply Super Repel (Bag). <- CURRENT TASK
2. Surf East to (23, 16), then North through the gap at (23, 15).
3. Surf North to (23, 11), then West to (18, 11).
4. Surf West to (17, 11) and land on the plateau at (16, 11).
5. Walk to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard ground.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Surf required.
- BUOY: Impassable water barrier.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable from North (blocks Down).

## Navigation: Buoy Walls & Gaps
- X=26 Wall: Gap at Row 10-14.
- X=22 Wall: Gap at Row 8 and Row 16-24.
- X=19/18 Wall: Gap at Row 14 and Row 26.
- Row 15 Wall: Gap at (23, 15).

## Inventory Check
- Super Repel: 4 remaining. Re-applied Turn 49300. (200 steps remaining).
- Party: Calcifer (Lv 64) leads. Ready for Eusine.

## Reflection Turn 49300
- Immediate Execution: Re-applying Repel to ensure safe passage to the plateau.
- Strategy: Identified a much shorter path to the plateau via the Row 11 northern bypass.
- Map Hygiene: Marking the (26, 8) buoy to prevent future navigation errors.
