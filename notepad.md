### Current Status
- **Location**: Cianwood City (22_9), Inside Pharmacy.
- **Goal**: Get SecretPotion.
- **Status**: Resetting interaction to try "No" option.
- **Hypothesis**: The "Need some medicine?" prompt defaults to "Yes" (Shop). Saying "No" might trigger the quest dialogue.

  2. Talk to Pharmacist again.
  3. When "Need some medicine?" appears, DO NOT PRESS A immediately.
  4. Press 'B' or 'Down' -> 'A' to select No.
- **Revised Plan (The "Slow & Steady" Approach)**:
  1. Clear dialogue/Reset room.
  2. Talk to Pharmacist.
  3. Advance text to "...along the way?".
  4. Press 'A' *once*.
  5. **WAIT** for the next turn to visually confirm the Yes/No menu.
  6. Press 'Down'.
  7. **WAIT** to confirm cursor moved.

- **Shuckle Guy**: Found at (17, 41) in Cianwood (Map 22_4). Offers a Shuckle to look after.
