## Strategy: Terrestrial Bypass to Suicune
**Start Turn:** 48900 (Quest: Trigger Suicune Overworld Sighting)

Cianwood is a maze of one-way barriers. I will land on the East Shore and walk through the city's internal gaps to reach the Northern Plateau.

### Step-by-Step Execution Plan
1. Use Super Repel. <- CURRENT TASK
2. Surf to (23, 32) and land on the East Shore.
3. Walk West to (12, 32), then South to (12, 48).
4. Walk West through the gaps: (7, 48) and (5, 48) to reach the West Beach (X=2).
5. Walk North to (2, 14), then East to (8, 14).
6. Walk North to (8, 12), then East to (14, 12).
7. Walk North to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune sighting.
