# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- Start Turn: 49771
- Start Time: 3:29 PM

## Strategy: The Row 34 Western Bypass (via Row 44 Gap)
The Western Corridor (X=0-2) is the only land path to the plateau. Row 34 allows entry to the corridor, but its ledges must be approached from the south.
1. Walk West along Row 32 to (12, 32). (In Progress)
2. Walk South along X=12 corridor to (12, 44).
3. Walk West through the gap at (9, 44) to (8, 44).
4. Walk North along X=8 to (8, 35).
5. Walk North to (8, 34) (Jumping the FLOOR_UP_WALL ledge).
6. Walk West along Row 34 to (2, 34).
7. Walk North through the Western Corridor to (2, 10).
8. Walk East along Row 10 to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

# Progress Notes
- Verified: FLOOR_UP_WALL blocks entry from the North (Turn 49811).
- Verified: Row 34 (X=2-5) is a clear corridor to the Western Corridor.
- Note: Out of Repels. No wild encounters on land in the city.
