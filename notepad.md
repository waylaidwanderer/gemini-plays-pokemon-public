# Suicune Quest (Crystal)
- Prerequisites: Sightings at Burned Tower, Cianwood, Route 42 (Done).
- Current Step: Trigger final sighting on Route 36.
- Strategy: Identify the precise trigger on Route 36. Pokedex 'Area' confirms it's here.
- Battle Plan (Tin Tower): Lead with XENON (Gastly). Turn 1: Hypnosis. Turn 2+: Night Shade for chip damage. Suicune (Lv40) lacks Roar in Crystal, so Mean Look is unnecessary. Use Great/Ultra Balls.
