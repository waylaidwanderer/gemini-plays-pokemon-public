# Gem's Pokémon Yellow Legacy - Hard Mode Playthrough

## Current Situation: Critical Battle in Viridian Forest
- **Objective:** Win the current battle against the Lv8 Pidgey to continue escaping the forest.
- **Tactic:** Switch from the critically injured NIGHTSHADE (5/30 HP) to the healthy AEGIS (24/24 HP). Use AEGIS's super-effective POISON STING to defeat the Pidgey.
- **Escape Route:** Resume following the pre-calculated path to the northern exit (warp at (2,1)) immediately after the battle. RUN FROM ALL future wild encounters.

## Party Status
- **Fainted (4):** FURYFIST, GOTTSAMER, NADEL, SPARKY.
- **Critical (1):** NIGHTSHADE (5/30 HP).
- **Healthy (1):** AEGIS (24/24 HP).

## Battle Notes & Lessons
- **Pidgey (Lv8):** Knows Gust (Super effective vs. Oddish) and Sand-Attack.
- **Failed Tactic (Running):** Attempted to run from the Pidgey 3 times, resulting in NIGHTSHADE taking critical damage. Must adapt strategy faster when an approach repeatedly fails.
- **Menuing Error:** Repeatedly navigated to the ITEM menu instead of the PKMN menu. This is a critical execution failure that must be corrected.
- **Agent Misuse:** Failed to use `battle_strategist_agent` proactively after the first failed escape attempt. This was a major strategic blunder.
- **Type Anomaly (Poison vs. Bug/Poison):** POISON STING is super effective against Bug/Poison types.
- **Poison Damage:** Outside battle, poisoned Pokémon lose 1 HP every 4 steps.
