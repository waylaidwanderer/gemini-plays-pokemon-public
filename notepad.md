# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Goal:** Check for credits, then continue completing the Pokedex.
- **Location:** Route 22 (Map 23_2).
- **Post-Red Status:** Team fully healed automatically.
- **Next Stop:** Viridian City -> Pallet Town.
- **Immediate Task:** Traverse Route 1 South to Pallet Town.
- **Status:** Traversing Route 1. At (2, 12).
- **Strategy:** Flanking West is confirmed viable by visual inspection (Grass at x=1), despite map data lag.
- **Discrepancy:** Previous turn intermediate states showed successful movement to (1, 14), but final game state reverted to (2, 12). This suggests a save state/load error or extreme rubber-banding. Re-attempting movement carefully.
- **Path:** Left to (1, 12) -> South to (1, 15) -> East to (2, 15) -> South to Pallet.
