# Suicune Capture Strategy (Crystal Version)
## Strategy: The Tin Tower Encounter
- Goal: Obtain the Clear Bell from the Radio Tower Director (Goldenrod City). (COMPLETE)
- Location: Tin Tower, Ecruteak City.
- Requirements: Defeat the three Sages in the Wise Trios Room.
- Preparation:
    - Prepare a 'Catcher' Pokémon: Parasect (Spore + False Swipe) is ideal.
    - Stock up on Ultra Balls and Level Balls.
- Strategy: False Swipe (to 1 HP) -> Spore (Sleep) -> Ultra Balls.
    - Best Catcher: Parasect (learns both moves).
    - Soft-reset (A+B+Start+Select) if it faints.

## Exploration Plan
- Goal: Reveal 100% of Route 32.
- Strategy: Use SURF at y=40-50 to reach the western corridor.
- Future Targets: West of (13, 10), East of (19, 28), Perimeter (1, 87).

## Tile Mechanics
### Route 32
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way North only. Blocks southward movement at y=6, 14, 24, 26, 34, 36, 72, 76, 86.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way South only. Found at (12, 27), (16, 15), (6, 81), (8, 81).
- LEDGE_HOP_RIGHT: One-way East only. Found at (17, 12), (17, 13), (17, 14), (9, 80).
- HEADBUTT_TREE: Impassable.

### Route 35
- FENCE/WALL: Impassable. Divides the route into west and east sections.
- WATER: Requires SURF to cross.

## Lessons Learned & Corrections
- **Type Matchups:** Ghost is immune to Normal/Fighting. Lick (Ghost) is ineffective against Normal. Hoppip is Grass/Flying and is NOT immune to Ghost moves (confused with Hoothoot).
- **Menu Navigation:** Start, Party, and Battle menus wrap. Always verify cursor position.
- **Tool Hygiene:** Refine custom tools immediately if they produce incorrect results.

## Event: Yanma Swarm
