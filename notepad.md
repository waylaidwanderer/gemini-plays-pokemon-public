# Lessons Learned
- Ecruteak Gym Path: (3,9)->(3,7)->(6,7)->(6,5)->(7,5)->Martha; (6,5)->(5,5)->(5,1)->Morty.
- Moomoo Farm: Sick Miltank needs 7 standard BERRY items.
- 4F Connectivity: Sections connected by gaps at y=2/3 (East-Middle) and y=14 (Middle-West).
- 5F Connectivity: Southern section (where Ernest is) is walled off from Northern section (where Ronald is). Must use 4F ladders.

# Berry Knowledge
- Mint (R39), Bitter (R31), Mystery (R35), Ice (R36).
- Strategy: Fly to New Bark Town after finding Jasmine. Check trees R29-R32.

# Trainer Progress (Olivine Lighthouse)
- Defeated: Alfred (2F), Huey (2F), Theo (3F), Preston (3F), Kent (4F), Connie (4F), Terrell (3F Middle), Ernest (5F).
- To Battle: Ronald (5F).

# Map Notes
- 3F Middle: Reachable via 4F pits (8,3)/(9,3).
- 5F Warps: (9,7) Ladder to 4F Middle, (9,15) Ladder to 4F East.
- 4F Warps: (9,7) Ladder to 5F South, (9,5) Ladder to 5F North.

# Swarm Events
- Yanma: Route 35 (Turn 5683).
- Turn 5688: Picked up SUPER REPEL at (6, 15).
- Youngster Ronald at (8, 3) is next. Path: 4F East (16, 7) -> Balcony -> 5F/6F -> Drop to 5F North. (Testing theory)
- Warp Verification: (16, 7) and (17, 7) on 4F are map transitions (walk RIGHT to trigger).
- 5F (9, 15) ladder leads down to 4F (13, 3). Avoid for now.
