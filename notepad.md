# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Stop Team Rocket.
- **Secondary Goal:** Investigate Radio Tower (Team Rocket takeover).
- **Navigation:** Navigate North to the Radio Tower.
- **Status:** Outside Goldenrod PC (18, 27).
- **Plan:**
    1. Walk North to Row 16 (Crossing point).
    2. Walk West to cross the train tracks/divider.
    3. Walk North to Radio Tower.
    4. Assess situation (blocked stairs, grunts, etc.).

## Reflections & Lessons
- **Fly Mechanic:** Must verify destination text before confirming. Do not batch navigation and confirmation.
- **Map Markers:** Distinguish PC types (Storage vs Research) to avoid confusion.
- **Menu Hygiene:** Ensure menus are fully closed to avoid state desync.
- **Navigation Lesson:** Always verify the path against specific tile data (Mental Map/ASCII) to identify obstacles like Headbutt Trees or Walls before defining a path plan. Straight lines are rarely safe.
