# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Reach the Dragon Shrine via the East Whirlpool.

# Current Status (Turn 18293)
- **Location:** Dragon's Den B1F (24, 22).
- **Facing:** Down (Verified).
- **Action:** Resetting Menu State.
- **Reasoning:** Previous attempt likely opened Pokedex instead of Party. Need to back out and verify cursor position.
- **Sequence:** `B` x4 (Close all), `Start` (Open Main Menu).

# Plan
1. Reset Menu to Main Menu.
2. Verify Cursor Position.
3. Select POKEMON -> Lapis -> WHIRLPOOL.
4. Cross Whirlpool.
5. Navigate South to Dragon Shrine Entrance.

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Requires HM06 Whirlpool + Glacier Badge. Usage: Menu -> Pokemon -> Select Mon -> Whirlpool.
- **Lava/Magma:** (None here, but good to remember).
- **Ice:** (None here).

# Lessons
- **Menu Navigation:** Always verify cursor position before committing to a sequence. Blind input leads to wrong menus (e.g., PACK instead of POKEMON).
