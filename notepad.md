# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Reach the Dragon Shrine via the East Whirlpool.

# Current Status (Turn 18301)
- **Location:** Dragon's Den B1F (24, 22).
- **Facing:** Down (Verified).
- **Action:** Use Whirlpool via Menu (Retry).
- **Reasoning:** Previous attempt failed due to facing; recent manual interaction didn't trigger. Menu is most reliable method.
- **Sequence:**
  1. `Start` (Open Main Menu).
  2. `A` (Pokemon).
  3. `Down`, `Down` (Select Lapis).
  4. `A` (Open Context).
  5. `Down` (Select Whirlpool).
  6. `A` (Execute).
  7. `A` (Confirm "Yes").

# Plan
1. Clear Whirlpool.
2. Surf across the gap to (24, 24).
3. Land on the island.
4. Enter Dragon Shrine.

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Requires HM06 Whirlpool + Glacier Badge. Usage: Menu -> Pokemon -> Select Mon -> Whirlpool.
- **Lava/Magma:** (None here, but good to remember).
- **Ice:** (None here).

# Lessons
- **Menu Navigation:** Always verify cursor position before committing to a sequence. Blind input leads to wrong menus (e.g., PACK instead of POKEMON).
