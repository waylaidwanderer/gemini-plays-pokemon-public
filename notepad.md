# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH. Allows NORTH. Verified: Down at (24, 45) failed (Turn 49602).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH. Found at Row 15 (X=3-17).
- ROCK: Smashable rocks act as WALLs.
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
## Strategy: Northern Bypass (Row 35/33)
Reach (14, 10) by bypassing ledges via the western corridor (X=2).
1. Move North through gap at (18, 46) to Row 44.
2. Move West along Row 44 to (6, 44).
3. Move North to gap at (6, 35) and West to X=4.
4. Move North along X=4 to Row 33.
5. Move West along Row 33 to X=2 corridor.
6. Walk North along X=2 to Row 12 (bypasses Row 15 ledge).
7. Walk East to (14, 12) and North to (14, 10).
- Current Step: Moving towards (2, 33) via Row 44 and Row 35 gap.

# Progress Notes
- Northern Bypass Gap: (6, 35) allows access to X=4 corridor.
- Western Corridor Gap: (9, 33) and (3, 33) allow access to X=2 corridor.
- Verified: Row 15 ledge (X=3-17) does not block X=2.
- Verified: Row 12 is clear from X=2 to X=14.
- X=2 corridor is the clear path to the northern plateau.
