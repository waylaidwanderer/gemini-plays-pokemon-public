# Suicune Hunt Strategy (Crystal)
- Started: Turn 22256 (Friday, Dec 26, 2025).
- Trigger Logic: Fixed sightings at Burned Tower, Cianwood, Route 42, and Route 36.
- Clear Bell: In inventory (obtained Turn 22639).
- Sighting 3 (Route 42): Attempting trigger on central island. Landing at (26, 15) and sweeping tiles (20-30, 10-17).
- Sighting 4: Route 36 (Sudowoodo junction).
- Sighting 5: Tin Tower 1F (Final Battle).

## Quest Timestamps
- Turn 23337: Ecruteak/Route 42 West Gatehouse hopping started.
- Turn 23387: Route 36 junction attempt (failed). Agent confirmed Route 42 sighting is mandatory.
- Turn 23389: Flying to Ecruteak to restart Route 42 sequence.
- Turn 23412-23491: Island sweep on Route 42.

## Current Sighting Plan: Route 42
1. Finish island sweep (20-30, 10-17).
2. Pivot Condition: If sweep is 100% complete with no sighting, immediately proceed to Wise Trio Room in Ecruteak City.
3. Verify Suicune status in Pokedex: Look for "Unknown" (stationary) or a single blinking dot (roaming). Ignore grid/checkerboard patterns.
