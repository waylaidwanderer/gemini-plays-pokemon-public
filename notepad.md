# Suicune Quest
- Status: 16 Badges, Clear Bell in inventory.
- Current Objective: Sighting 2 (Cianwood City North Beach).
- Strategy: The 'East Loop' path. The northern plateau is landlocked and protected by buoy lines. Reach it by going east to X=27, then north to row 8, then west to X=15.
- Route: (23, 17) -> (27, 17) -> (27, 8) [Sea Loop Pivot] -> (15, 8) -> (15, 10) [Land].
- Battle Strategy: Lead with XENON (Haunter) for Hypnosis.
- History: 130 turns spent navigating Cianwood. Confirmed land detour to Row 51 is blocked. Gap at (23, 15) is a dead end due to X=22 buoy wall.
