# Suicune Quest Strategy: 'Land Detour'
- Goal: Reach north beach sighting area at (7, 4).
- Problem: Buoy walls block water access to the north beach.
- Solution: Land at the 'East Coast Surf Point' (19, 30) and walk through the city.
- Route:
    1. Sail to (19, 30) and land.
    2. Walk to (12, 30) -> (12, 29) -> (11, 29) -> (11, 15) [Wall Gap].
    3. Walk to (7, 14) -> (7, 4).
- Battle Strategy: Lead with XENON (Haunter) for Hypnosis.
- History: Spent 130 turns attempting to navigate the buoy maze. Confirmed water access is heavily restricted. Landing and walking is the intended solution.
