### Current Status
- **Location**: Flower Shop (Goldenrod City).
- **Badge**: Plain Badge (Obtained).
- **Key Items**: Radio Card, Bicycle, Coin Case, Plain Badge.

### Objectives
1. Get SquirtBottle.
2. Go to Route 34 (Daycare).
3. Defeat Sudowoodo (Route 36).

### Tile Mechanics
- TYPE_3fe2: Floor (Walkable)
- TYPE_63e2: Wall/Planter (Blocked)
- TYPE_ffbb: Warp/Door (Walkable)
- Plan: I likely haven't 'seen' the Sudowoodo yet, which is why the Flower Shop Girl won't give me the SquirtBottle. I need to travel North to Route 35, through the National Park, to Route 36, and interact with the Sudowoodo. Then return to the Flower Shop.
