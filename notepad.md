Fly Strategy: v20.0. Attempt #23. Sequence: B(x2) -> Start -> Reset Main (Up x8) -> POKEMON (Down) -> A -> Reset Party (Up x6) -> Icarus (Down x5) -> A -> A (FLY) -> sleep -> Left x20 -> A -> sleep -> A -> sleep -> A. Total Fly failures: 22. Current Turn: #51047. Goal: Cianwood (14, 10). Prep: Calcifer in lead. Focus: SUICUNE sighting. Logic: 22 manual/tool failures necessitated a full-system reset sequence with absolute-mashing resets and optimized button counts. Accuracy is the only priority. v20.0 is the definitive flight sequence.
