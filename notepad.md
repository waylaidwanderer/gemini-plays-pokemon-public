## III. Area & Navigation Insights

### Tile Traversal Rules (Verified)
- **Objects are impassable:** All map objects (items, trees, signs, defeated trainers etc.) act as walls.
- **WALL:** Impassable.
- **FLOOR:** Traversable.
- **TALL_GRASS:** Traversable, triggers wild encounters.
- **LEDGE:** One-way downward traversal.
- **FLOOR_HOP_*_LEDGE:** One-way traversal in the specified direction.
- **COUNTER:** Impassable.
- **DOOR/CAVE:** Warp tile, triggered by movement.
- **MART_SHELF/BOOKSHELF/TV/RADIO/PC/TOWN_MAP/WINDOW/PAINTING:** Impassable scenery.
- **WATER/CUT_TREE/BUOY:** Impassable.
- **PILLAR:** Impassable.
- **VOID:** Impassable.
- **WARP_CARPET_*: Warp tile, direction-specific.
- **FRUIT_TREE:** Impassable object, may yield items.
- **LADDER:** A warp tile, triggered by movement (not by pressing 'A'). Can be one-way or two-way. Must be tested.
- **STATUE:** An impassable scenery object.

### Sprout Tower Layout
- The central pillar on all floors is a complete divider, preventing east-west travel on the same floor, except for the 3rd floor.
- To cross between the east and west sides of the tower, you must go to the 3rd floor.
- The ladder at (10, 14) on 2F is a one-way warp *down* from the 3rd floor.
- The western side of the 1st floor is a dead end for exiting the tower.
- The main tower exit is on the eastern side of the 1st floor at (9, 15).

## IV. Future Plans & Untested Hypotheses

- **Hypothesis:** Can Onix learn Flash (HM05)?
- **Hypothesis:** HMs can be taught from the Pokémon status screen.
