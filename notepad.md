# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Verified Strategy: The Plateau Landing
The northern plateau (14, 10) is most efficiently reached by Surfing from the central land mass and landing at the northern plateau landing (13, 16). This bypasses all one-way terrace slopes.

### Execution Plan
1. Central Approach: Walk to the central Surf point at (12, 28). (In Progress)
2. Central Surf: Surf East into the central lake and navigate North to (14, 16).
3. Plateau Landing: Land at (13, 16) and walk West/North around the internal walls.
4. Trigger Suicune: Reach (14, 10) to initiate the event.

### Land Path from Landing (13, 16) to Suicune (14, 10)
- Walk West to (0, 16).
- Walk Up to (0, 14).
- Walk East to (8, 14).
- Walk Up to (8, 12).
- Walk East to (14, 12).
- Walk Up to (14, 10).

## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard land (Traversable).
- WATER: Water (Requires Surf).
- WALL: Impassable.
- BUOY: Impassable water barrier.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way North (e.g., Row 46, 34, 20).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way South (e.g., Row 15).
