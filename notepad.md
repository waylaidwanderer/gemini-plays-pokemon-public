## Quest: Ilex Forest Farfetch'd
- **Apprentice Hint**: "Get behind it."
- **Observed Behavior**:
  - Startle: Interacting from front/side makes it fly ~6 tiles.
  - Turning: Bird turns to face the player if they step on noisy tiles (twigs).
  - Noisy Tiles: (23,31) to (28,31) confirmed. Alert the bird when stepped on.
