# Strategy: The Suicune Pursuit
- **Primary Goal:** Trigger Suicune sighting at (14, 10).
- **Secondary Goal:** Defeat Eusine immediately after sighting.
- **Eusine Roster:** Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25).
- **Battle Strategy:** Lead with Lv64 Calcifer. Sweep with Flamethrower/Thunderpunch.
- **Navigation Plan (Surf Route):**
  1. Navigate to (12, 28) and use Surf.
  2. Surf East to X=23 (bypass buoys).
  3. Surf North to Row 10.
  4. Surf West to (16, 10) or (15, 10) and land.
  5. Walk to (14, 10).

# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard traversable terrain.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable terrain.
- WATER: Traversable only with Surf.
- DOOR / WARP_CARPET: Map transition points.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Allows jumping down (South) but blocks movement from the opposite direction (North).
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Terrace edges. Hypothesis: Can be walked across horizontally or entered from specific sides.
- ROCK (Object): Blocks movement; can be cleared with Rock Smash. Respawns upon map transition.

# Lessons Learned
- **Cianwood Pathing:** (11, 15) leads to a dead-end pocket. (4, 20) blocks South movement.
- **Respawn Logic:** Overworld rocks respawn when leaving and re-entering the area.
- **Poke Seer's House:** (5, 17) is a regular interior, not a shortcut.
