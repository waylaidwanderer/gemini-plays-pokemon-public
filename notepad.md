- **Current Strategy**: Systematically scan the North Wall (Row 5-8) for the exit.
- **Status**: x=4 (Tracks) blocked. x=13 blocked. x=18 (Main) blocked by Flower Shop. x=31 blocked.
- **Hypothesis**: Missed a path between x=20 and x=28 (near Gym) or x=6 and x=12.
- **Immediate**: Go East to Main Road, then check area near Gym again.
- **Timestamp**: Turn 7985.
