# Strategy: The Suicune Pursuit
- **Objective:** Trigger Suicune sighting at (14, 10) in northern Cianwood.
- **Eusine Battle Prep:** Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25). Strategy: Lead with Lv64 Calcifer. Sweep with Flamethrower/Thunderpunch.
- **Current Hypothesis:** The "South Bypass" via (6, 46) allows access to the far-left corridor (X=2).
- **Contingency:** If (6, 46) is impassable Westward, the northern plateau may be unreachable via walking. I will attempt to Surf around the east side buoy gap at (23, 25). If that also fails, I will pivot to the Lighthouse quest.

# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard traversable terrain.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable terrain.
- WATER: Traversable only with Surf.
- DOOR / WARP_CARPET: Map transition points.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump down (South). Blocks North.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Terrace edges. (6, 46) hypothesized to allow climbing West. (4, 20) verified to block South.
- ROCK (Object): Blocks movement; cleared with Rock Smash. Respawns upon map transition.

# Lessons Learned
- **Cianwood Pathing:** (11, 15) and (12, 14) are dead ends for northern access.
- **Surf Navigation:** Buoy barriers partition the water; navigation requires specific gaps (e.g. X=16 Row 25).
- **Poke Seer's House:** (5, 17) is a regular interior.
- **Time Check:** Attempting sighting since Turn #50620. Commit to decisive paths or pivot by Turn #51000.
