## Strategy: Northern Plateau Access via Buoy Bypass
**Start Turn:** 48900 (Quest: Trigger Suicune Overworld Sighting)

Cianwood's internal walls and buoys create a maze. The Northern Plateau (Suicune sighting) is accessible by Surfing to Row 10 to pass the X=26 wall, then Row 8 to bypass the X=22 and X=19 buoy walls.

### Step-by-Step Execution Plan
1. Surf South to Row 10, then West to (25, 10) via the gap at (26, 10).
2. Surf North to Row 8, then West to (18, 8), bypassing the X=22 and X=19 walls.
3. Surf South to (18, 11), then West to land on the plateau at (16, 11).
4. Walk to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune sighting.

## Tile Mechanics: Cianwood City
- FLOOR: Standard traversable ground.
- WALL: Standard impassable barrier.
- WATER: Traversable only with Surf HM.
- BUOY: Impassable water barrier.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable from the North side (blocks Down movement).

## Failed Hypotheses & Lessons
- Row 8 Bypass East: Blocked by BUOY at (26, 8). Must enter Row 8 from X=25.
- Southern Crossing: Blocked by recurring 'FLOOR_UP_WALL' lines.
- Inner Channel South: Blocked at Row 15 by a solid buoy/wall line.

## Inventory Check
- Super Repel: 5 remaining. Last applied turn 49278. (~22 steps remaining per Overwatch).
