# Suicune Quest (Crystal) - FIXED SIGHTINGS
- Milestone 1: Burned Tower (Seen).
- Milestone 2: Cianwood City (Seen). Defeated Eusine.

## Strategy/Hypotheses:
- Hypothesis: Suicune is in the hidden pocket reachable only through the western Mt. Mortar entrance.
- Test 1: Navigate through Mt. Mortar (10, 5) to see if it exits into the Western Pocket (Route 42, Rows 1-2, X=7-11).
- Note: Multiple exhaustive sweeps of the island center (X=24-30, Y=14-17) failed to trigger Suicune.

# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Traversable with HM03 SURF.
- TALL_GRASS / LONG_GRASS: Traversable; triggers encounters.
- LEDGE: One-way traversable (usually South).
- WARP / DOOR / WARP_CARPET / CAVE: Map transition. Step triggers warp.
- FRUIT_TREE: Impassable; interact for fruit/apricorn.
- HEADBUTT_TREE: Impassable; interact with HM02 HEADBUTT.
- CUT_TREE: Impassable until cleared with HM01 CUT.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way wall; jumpable from North to South.

# Discoveries
- Headbutt Trees: Numerous on Route 42 (documented in markers).
- Dead End: (48, 3) plateau is a dead end.
- Goldeen Encounter: (34, 10) in water on Route 42.

# PC Storage (Box 1)
- VORTEX (Poliwag 22), INTERCEPT (Yanma 12), ROCKY (Onix 6), EGG (CleFFA 5), XFDW (Meowth 16), FRITTATA (Togepi 5), SHUCKIE (Shuckle 15), Blarney (Sudowoodo 20), CINNABAR (Goldeen 21).

# Contacts & Key Items
- Fire Stone: Route 36 (Alan).
- Rock Smash (Info): Route 36 (Fisher).
- Fisher Tully: Route 42. Gives items.
- Bug Catcher Arnie: Route 35. Reports Yanma swarms.
- Clear Bell: Obtained.

# General Lessons
- Route 42 Navigation: The island center is accessible via (24, 13) after using CUT. To get off, use the same path.
- Suicune Tracking: If the Pokedex AREA map shows a location, Suicune is likely roaming. If it shows no location but is known to be on the route, it is a scripted stationary encounter.

# Task Timestamps
- Suicune Hunt (Route 42): Started Turn 17642.
- Island Sweep Attempts: 17968, 17985, 18002, 18021, 18120.
- Pivot to Western Pocket: Turn 18122.

# Battle Mechanics & Type Effectiveness
- Normal-type Pokémon (e.g. RATICATE) are immune to Ghost-type moves (e.g. LICK, NIGHT SHADE). Verified Turn 18137.
- Ghost-type moves do not affect Normal-type Pokémon.
