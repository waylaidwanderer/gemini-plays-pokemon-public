# Strategy: The Suicune Pursuit
- **Quest Started:** Turn #50620
- **Goal:** Fly to Cianwood -> Smash boulders at (4, 19) and (8, 16) -> Reach Suicune sighting spot at (14, 10).
- **Execution:** Use ICARUS (Pidgeotto) to Fly to Cianwood City.

# Global Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL / BUOY / HEADBUTT_TREE: Impassable.
- WATER: Requires Surf.
- DOOR / WARP_CARPET: Warp point.
- STAIRCASE: Warp point (stairs/elevator).
- COUNTER: Impassable; interact from adjacent tile.
- SMASHABLE_ROCK (Object): Requires Rock Smash.

# Lessons Learned
- **Fisher Dialogue:** "If any rocks are in your way..." is post-gift. flag set even if item gone. (Verified on Route 36)
- **Menu Navigation:** The "Switch items?" confirmation box is modal; B button does not close it. Use A on NO to exit.
- **Fly Map:** Cursor behavior: requires multiple directional presses to traverse between town hitboxes. Relative positions: New Bark (East), Cherrygrove (West of New Bark), Violet (North of Cherrygrove), Azalea (South), Goldenrod (West/North of Azalea), Olivine (West), Cianwood (Far West).
- **Coordinates:** Notepad coordinates (e.g., New Bark 14, 10) refer to the World Map/Town Map grid, not the Fly Map cursor position.
