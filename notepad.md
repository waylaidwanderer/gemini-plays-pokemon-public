## Strategy: Inner Channel Crossing to Suicune
**Start Turn:** 48900 (Quest: Trigger Suicune Overworld Sighting)

Cianwood's terrestrial path is blocked by ledges. The northern plateau is accessible by Surfing through the Row 15 gap and landing at the inner island.

### Step-by-Step Execution Plan
1. Walk to the Surf point at (23, 32). <- CURRENT TASK
2. Surf North to the Row 15 gap at (23, 15).
3. Surf North to Row 14, then West to (18, 14) (Bypasses X=19 wall).
4. Surf South to (18, 16), then West to land at (13, 16).
5. Walk West to (11, 16), then North through the gap at (11, 15).
6. Walk to the plateau entrance at (8, 14).
7. Walk North to (8, 10), then East to (14, 10).
8. Trigger Suicune sighting.

## Tile Mechanics: Cianwood City
- FLOOR: Standard traversable ground.
- WALL: Impassable barrier.
- WATER: Traversable only with Surf HM.
- BUOY: Impassable water barrier.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way ledge. Blocks DOWN movement (Y to Y+1). Allows UP and East-West movement. (Verified at (6, 46) and (7, 34)).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump South. Impassable from the North side.

## Failed Hypotheses & Lessons
- Terrestrial Path (South): Blocked by ledges.
- Great Sea Bypass (Route 40): Dead end on the West.
- Inner Channel South: Blocked at Row 15 by solid buoy line (except X=23).

## Inventory Check
- Super Repel: 4 remaining. Applied turn 49346. (~165 steps remaining).
- Party: Calcifer (Lv 64) leads. Ready for Eusine.
