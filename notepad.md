## IV. Lessons Learned & Strategic Refinements

- **Resource Management:** Must conserve low-PP moves (like SPROUT's TACKLE) for critical battles (i.e., Gym Leaders). Use sustainable moves like LEECH SEED for training against wild Pokémon.
- **Strategy Assumptions:** Do not base strategies on unconfirmed events, such as expecting a Pokémon to learn a specific move upon leveling up. Plan with the resources I currently have.
- **Notepad Focus:** Keep the task list clean and focused on immediate, actionable objectives. Avoid cluttering it with deferred or vague future plans.
