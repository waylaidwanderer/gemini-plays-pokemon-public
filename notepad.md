# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- Quest Start: Turn 48900

## Strategy: The Southern Bypass (Row 51)
To reach the northern plateau at (14, 10), Gem must bypass the city's one-way upward ledges. The most reliable route is to reach the southern corridor at Row 51, walk west to the western corridor (X=2), and then head north.

## Execution Plan
1. Use Super Repel. (Done Turn 49487).
2. Reach Row 49 corridor via (18, 46) gap.
   - Current Path: (20, 40) -> (20, 42) -> (18, 42) -> (18, 48).
3. Walk west to (11, 48), then south through gap at (11, 50) to (11, 51).
4. Walk west to (2, 51), then north along X=2 to (2, 12).
5. Walk east to (14, 12), then north to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune sighting.

## Verified Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks DOWN movement. (Verified: (12, 50), (13, 50) are impassable from the north).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. (Verified: (10, 15) is impassable from the south).
- Row 46 Gap: X=18, 19 (FLOOR).
- Row 48 Gap: X=12-19 (FLOOR).
- Row 50 Gap: X=10, 11 (FLOOR).

## Failed Hypotheses
- Island Hop (13, 16): Dead end alcove at (11, 14).
- Southern Surf Bypass: Eastern channel ends at Row 45.
- Direct Terrestrial (West): Blocked by wall lines and upward ledges.

## Progress Summary
- Badges: 16/16.
- Current Focus: Suicune overworld sighting.
