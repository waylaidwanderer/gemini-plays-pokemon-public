# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Strategy: The Great Western Loop
The northern plateau (14, 10) is accessible via the western coastal corridor (X=2). This requires a long loop through the southern terrace gaps to bypass the central walls and elevation traps.

### Execution Plan
1. Southern Descent: Navigate to (10, 51) via the gap at (10, 34). (In Progress)
2. Western Crossing: Walk west along Row 51 to (2, 51).
3. Coastal Ascent: Walk north along X=2 to Row 12.
4. Final Approach: Walk east to (14, 12) and north to (14, 10).

## Global Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Land (Traversable).
- WALL, BUOY, DOOR: Impassable.
- WATER: Requires Surf.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way North. Blocks DOWN movement (e.g., Row 50; 6-8, 34; 4, 20; 4, 30).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way South. Blocks NORTH movement (e.g., 10, 15).

## Battle Plan: Eusine
- Expected Team: Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25).
- Lead: Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion).
- Strategy: Flamethrower sweep. (Flamethrower is super effective against Haunter and neutral but high damage against the others. Level gap provides a massive safety margin.)
