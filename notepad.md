# Strategic Goals
1. **Wake Snorlax:** Needs Poke Flute (EXPN Card obtained) & Power.
   - *Status:* Interaction active. Radio Tuned to 20.
   - *Action:* Press A to advance text -> Battle Snorlax.
   - *Battle Strategy:*
     - **Lead:** Muscle (Machoke Lv76).
     - **Chip:** Thunderpunch (Para chance) or Ice Punch (Freeze chance).
     - **Catch:** Ultra Ball (x21) when HP is low.
   - *Next:* Enter Diglett's Cave.
2. **Collect Badges:** Thunder (Done), Marsh (Done).

# Mechanics & Discoveries
- **EXPN Card:** Hidden upgrade to Pokegear. Validated.
- **Snorlax:** Located at (34, 8) in Vermilion City. Blocks Diglett's Cave.

# Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR:** Traversable.
- **WALL:** Impassable.
- **LADDER:** Interact/Walk to warp.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Blocked from North.
- **WARP_CARPET_DOWN:** Walk off map edge.
- **Ledge:** Jump down (South) only.

# Active Quests
- **Bill's Grandpa:** Wants Lickitung.
- **Repel active:** Turn 22378 (Max Repel)

# Lessons Learned
- **Verification:** Always verify possession of Key Items (like EXPN Card) in the inventory before attempting to use them. Do not assume they were acquired during story events.
- **Troubleshooting:** If a mechanic (like the Radio) fails, check the prerequisites (Key Items) first before blaming the mechanics (tuning).
- **Route 8:** Underground Path is closed (shut down by police). Bikers control the surface road.
- **Radio Tuning:** Must press 'A' to enter the Radio module before tuning works. Cursor position alone is insufficient.
- **Menu Navigation:** Start menu cursor wraps and remembers position. Double check cursor starting point.

# Reflection (Turn 22694)
- **Execution:** No deferred tasks. Fixed EXPN card oversight immediately.
- **Notepad:** Organized. Added "Lessons Learned".
- **Map:** Markers are accurate. Snorlax marked.
- **Tools:** Pathfinding and Battle tools are performing well.
- **Goals:** Clear. Wake Snorlax -> Diglett's Cave.
- **Errors:** Radio tuning failure analyzed and corrected. Inventory assumption corrected.
- Attempting to interact with Snorlax from (34, 9) or (34, 10).
- If Snorlax doesn't wake, verify Radio Channel 20.
- Discrepancy detected: ScreenText shows Pokegear active, but CurrentScreen shows Start Menu. Trusting CurrentScreen and inputs (B, Start).
- Start Menu cursor is on POKEGEAR. Pressing A to open.
- Menu loop detected: Start Menu -> A -> Pokegear (Intermediate) -> Start Menu (Current).
- Resolved: Previous input failure (mixed buttons) caused cursor to not move.
- Current State: Pokegear Open, Cursor on BACK.
- Plan: Use slow_press to navigate Right x3 to Radio, then A to select.
- Inventory check: EXPN CARD is missing from GameState Key Items list. However, Radio UI shows scale up to 20 (past 15), suggesting the upgrade is active. Proceeding with tuning.
- Tuning Plan: Press Up x5 to clamp to Channel 20 (Max). Check for 'POKE FLUTE' text next turn.
- Snorlax interaction confirmed "Snoring peacefully".
- Hypothesis: Radio was not actually tuned to the Poke Flute channel or stopped playing.
- Action: Re-opening Radio to visually confirm "POKE FLUTE" text.
- Navigation Plan: B (Close Text) -> Start (Menu) -> A (Pokegear) -> Right x3 (Radio) -> A (Enter).
- Radio Tuning: Currently at max frequency (approx 20+). Text shows "TUNING".
- Hypothesis: Poke Flute is at Channel 20.0. Need to tune down slightly to find the exact frequency.
- Action: Pressing 'Down' to decrease frequency.
- Observation needed: Does text change to "POKE FLUTE"?
- Radio Tuning Successful: 'POKé FLUTE' text confirmed near max frequency.
- Action: Exiting Radio/Pokegear (B, B) and interacting with Snorlax (A) to trigger battle.
- Snorlax woke up! Battle imminent.
- Battle Plan: Lead with Muscle. Use weak moves (Ice Punch/Thunderpunch) to chip. Try to catch with Ultra Balls. If failing/low health, knock it out.
- Snorlax is blocking Diglett's Cave entrance at (34, 7).
- Snorlax HP ~70%. Holding Leftovers (recovers HP).
- Snorlax used Rollout.
- Muscle's Thunderpunch does ~30%.
- Strategy: Use Thunderpunch again to chip. If Snorlax uses Rest, prepare to catch while asleep.
- Note: 'smart_battle_move' with current_slot=2 and target_slot=2 should safely select the current cursor position (likely Thunderpunch or Strength).
- Battle Update: Muscle used Thunderpunch (Low dmg). Snorlax used Rollout. Leftovers recovery.
- Cursor Logic: Assuming cursor remains on Thunderpunch (Slot 2).
- Plan: Continue using Thunderpunch to fish for Paralysis and chip HP. Avoid physical moves for now to prevent accidental KO.
- Snorlax Status: Red HP, Paralyzed.
- Danger: Do NOT attack again. Muscle is too strong.
- Action: Throw Ultra Balls until caught. Snorlax has Leftovers, so it will heal slowly.
- Snorlax has Rest (likely). If it Rests, it will wake up and cure paralysis. Be ready to re-paralyze if safe, or just throw balls at full health sleep.
- Throwing Ultra Ball (Attempt 1) - Confirmed.
- Current Stock: 20 Ultra Balls (after this throw).
- Snorlax is Paralyzed and Low HP. This is the best chance.
- Catch Attempt 1 failed ("So close!").
- Snorlax used Rollout (locked in). Muscle taking negligible damage.
- Snorlax recovered with Leftovers. Status still Paralyzed.
- Action: Throwing Ultra Ball (Attempt 2). Count: 20.
- Catch Attempt 2 failed ("Almost had it!").
- Snorlax used Rollout. Muscle HP 228/254. Snorlax HP ~Red.
- Action: Throwing Ultra Ball (Attempt 3). Count: 18 (after this throw).
- Current State: Ball thrown. Watching result.

- Escaped from Diglett.
- Exploring West branch.
- West branch: Hit wall at (5, 17).
- Action: Moving North along column 6.
- Goal: Find north exit to Route 2.

- East side appears blocked by wall at col 8.
- Path forces West to column 3.
- Navigating to (3, 9) to continue North.
- Navigating North along western corridor (cols 2-3).
- Targeted destination: (3, 4) (currently unseen).
- Found ladder at (3, 3) in western corridor.
- This should be the exit to Route 2 (Pewter City side).
- Box 1 is still full. Priority is PC.
- Ladder at (3, 3) warped to (17, 3) (Top-Right section).
- Found Exit Warp at (15, 5). This MUST be Route 2.

- Map Analysis: Row 12 is a wall blocking South on the West side.
- Path to Pewter likely requires going East to x=14 to bypass the wall.
- Fruit Tree at (10, 14) appears inaccessible from current position due to Row 12 wall. Need to find entrance (Cut tree?).
