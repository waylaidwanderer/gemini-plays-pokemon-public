# Strategic Notes
## Objectives
- **Primary:** Reach Indigo Plateau (Money Farming Loop).
- **Secondary:** Defeat Elite Four.
- **Tertiary:** Hunt Roamers (Raikou/Entei) - *Paused*.

## Current Task: Traverse Victory Road 2F (West -> East)
- **Location:** Victory Road 2F (ID: 3_91) at (3, 33).
- **Goal:** Reach Ladder at (13, 31).
- **Route:** `(3, 33) -> Jump Down (3, 34) -> (3, 35) -> East to (12, 35) -> North to (12, 31) -> (13, 31)`.
- **Reasoning:** 
  - Visual analysis suggests (3, 34) is a jumpable ledge.
  - Jumping down allows access to y=35 corridor.
  - x=12 is a path North to the Ladder at (13, 31).
  - Previous navigation failed, likely due to tool limitations with ledges. Using manual button press.

## Status
- **Money:** ¥3294.
- **Party:** Gyarados (Lead), Lugia, Machoke, Pidgey, Oddish, Quilava.
