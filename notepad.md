## Strategy: West Beach Highway Route to Suicune
Use the 'West Beach Highway' (X=0-2) to reach the northern plateau, bypassing the central city blockades.

### Step-by-Step Execution Plan
1. Move to (12, 50) via X=12 corridor. <- CURRENT TASK
2. Move to (2, 50) to enter the West Beach Highway.
3. Walk north to (2, 11) along the beach.
4. Cross east to the plateau at (14, 11) via Row 11.
5. Reach Suicune trigger point at (14, 10).

## Tile Mechanics: Cianwood City
- FLOOR: Standard traversable ground.
- WALL: Standard impassable barrier.
- WATER: Traversable only with Surf HM.
- BUOY: Impassable water barrier.
- DOOR: Warp point to building interior.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump South. Impassable from the North side (cannot jump back up).
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable from the North. Behaves like a wall when moving Down into it.

## Failed Hypotheses & Lessons
- Inner Channel North (X=12-17): Blocked at Row 15 by WALL. Cannot surf north past Row 15.
- Direct Westward Path (Row 33): Blocked at (5, 33) by WALL.
- Plateau North Entry (X=11): Blocked at (11, 13) by WALL.
- X=5 Wall: Gaps found at Row 34-37 and Row 46-51.
- X=7 Wall: Gaps found at Row 44 and Row 48-51.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL (Row 46, 48): Impassable from the North. Blocks (6, 45) -> (6, 46).

## Battle Strategy: Eusine
- Lead: Calcifer (Lv 64 Typhlosion).
- Strategy: Sweep with Flamethrower. OHKO potential on most targets.

## Inventory Check
- Super Repel: 7 remaining. Last applied turn 49091. (~140 steps used/available). Re-apply at next message.
