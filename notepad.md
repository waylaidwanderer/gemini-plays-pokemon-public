- WATER: Traversable only via Surf.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- FLOOR: Standard walkable ground.
- WALL: Impassable obstacle.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Represents a ledge face. Impassable from the SOUTH (cannot walk north). Behaves as FLOOR from other directions.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump from NORTH to SOUTH.
- (11, 14): Dead End Pocket. Wall at (11, 13) and (12, 14) blocks access to the north plateau.

# Quest Strategies
## Suicune: 'The Beach Shortcut' (Bypasses the Spiral)
- Discovery: The buoy spiral can be completely bypassed by walking on the southern beach.
- Route:
    1. Walk to the southern beach area (around Y=30).
    2. Move west on land from (19, 30) to (15, 30).
    3. Use Surf at (15, 30) or (16, 29).
    4. Sail North along the western edge of the buoy walls (X=14 or X=15) to the landing spot at (14, 10).
    5. Walk to Suicune sighting spot at (7, 4).
- Fact: This avoids all zig-zagging and is much faster.
- Preparation: Lead with XENON (Haunter). Use SUPER REPEL.
