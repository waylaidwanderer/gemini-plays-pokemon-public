# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Deliver Kenya to Route 31.
- **Secondary Goal:** Travel to Mahogany Town (Route 42).
- **Tertiary Goal:** Train Party to Level 30+.
- **Immediate Action:** Return to Fisher at (17, 7).
  1. **Observation:** Cooltrainer M gave generic text ("Dark Cave... Light it up..."). He did NOT acknowledge the mail.
  2. **Recall:** Notepad claims Fisher at (17, 7) said "This MAIL isn't for me".
  3. **Hypothesis:** The Fisher IS the recipient (or at least checks mail), but the mail content/format is wrong. The Cooltrainer is irrelevant to the quest.
  4. **Plan:**
     - Walk West to Fisher.
     - Talk to him to CONFIRM he checks the mail.
     - If he rejects it, I must fix the mail text (Case sensitivity? Line breaks?).
- **Route Info:** Head West along the path.
- **Mail Status:** Kenya holding mail with message "DARK CAVE leads to another road" (ALL CAPS?). Need to verify text.

## Party Status
- **Team:** Muscle (41), Garnet (28), Hematite (15), Azurite (13), Lapis (12), Mistral (13), Kenya (10).
- **Inventory:** Contains FLOWER MAIL (3 in Bag).

## Quests
- **Webster's Mail:** Delivering Kenya (Spearow) to Route 31. Recipient is the Sleeping Man (Cooltrainer) near Dark Cave.
- **Gyms:** 6 Badges. Next: Mahogany (Glacier).

## Mechanics Notes
- **Fly Map:** Navigation is list-based via `Up`/`Down`. Order: New Bark -> Cherrygrove -> Violet -> Azalea -> Goldenrod.
- **Menu Cursor:** Remember position! Always reset or verify.

### Reflection (Turn 8681)
- **Execution:** Addressed "Cursor Memory" issues by resetting via Start Menu. Debugged Fly Map navigation step-by-step.
- **Notepad:** Cleaned up obsolete typing logs. Recorded Fly Map list logic.
- **Lesson:** When blind inputs fail, STOP and verify with screen text. Do not assume standard grid navigation.
