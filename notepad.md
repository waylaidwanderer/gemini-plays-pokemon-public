# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Verified Strategy: The Grand Land Loop
The northern plateau (14, 10) is accessible via a land-based route that loops through the southern part of the city (Row 51) and then ascends through the western terraces. This route bypasses all ledges and water barriers.

### Execution Plan
1. Southern Detour: Walk to the southern beach at (6, 51) by passing through the gap at Column 4 (Row 30-51). (In Progress)
2. Terrace Ascent: Climb the sequence of one-way upward slopes:
   - Climb 1: (6, 46) [UP_WALL]
   - Climb 2: (6, 34) [UP_WALL]
   - Climb 3: (4, 30) [UP_WALL]
   - Climb 4: (4, 20) [UP_WALL]
3. Western Bypass: Move West to Column 2 and North to Row 14.
4. Plateau Entry: Walk East along Row 14 to (8, 14) and North to Row 12.
5. Final Approach: Walk East along Row 12 to (14, 12) and North to Suicune at (14, 10).

## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard land (Traversable).
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way North (Verified at (6, 46)).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way South.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Requires Surf.
