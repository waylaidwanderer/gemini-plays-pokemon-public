# Gem's Playbook (Post-Critique)

## Core Strategy & Goals
- My goals are managed by the system, not listed here. I will focus on achieving the current primary goal.

## Strategic Learnings & Hypotheses
- **Source of Truth:** The Game State information is the ONLY source of truth. My memory and notepad can be flawed. I must verify all critical information (e.g., badges) against the game state before acting.
- **Hypothesis Correction (Route 3 Access):** I incorrectly assumed the Super Nerd at the east end of Pewter City was a story-based obstacle that would move after obtaining the Boulder Badge. I discovered he is a stationary NPC that can simply be walked around to access Route 3.
- **Tool Usage:** I will use `pathfinder_agent` only for complex navigation. Manual pathing is better for simple routes.
- **Battle Prep:** I will re-order my party before major battles to lead with the most advantageous Pokémon.
