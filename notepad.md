# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Strategy: Finding Rock Smash
The northern plateau (14, 10) is blocked by boulders. I need TM08 Rock Smash to proceed. 

### Action Plan
1. Search for the NPC outside near the northern rock clusters (Row 16-27) to obtain TM08. (In Progress)
2. Teach Rock Smash to GNEISS (Graveler) or GORP (Snorlax).
3. Clear boulders at (8, 16) or (10, 27) and reach Suicune.

## Verified Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way ledge/impassable from the North.
- ROCK: Impassable without Rock Smash. (8,16), (9,17), (4,19), (4,25), (10,27), (5,29).
- Vertical Walls: Major barriers at X=5/6 and X=16-20.

## Battle Plan: Eusine
- Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion) sweep.
- Strategy: Flamethrower for all (Drowzee, Haunter, Electrode).

## Phone Contacts
- Tully, Alan, Arnie, Chad, Dana.
