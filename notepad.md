## Strategy: Southern Rim Terrestrial Route to Suicune
**Start Turn:** 48900 (Quest: Trigger Suicune Overworld Sighting)

Cianwood is divided by vertical walls and ledges. The only confirmed North-South gap through the FLOOR_UP_WALL line (Row 46/48/50) is in Strip 4 at X=18-19.

### Step-by-Step Execution Plan
1. Walk to (18, 45) via Row 45 to bypass the Lass at (14, 44). <- CURRENT TASK
2. Walk South to (18, 52) (Southern Rim).
3. Walk West along Row 52 to (2, 52) (West Beach Highway).
4. Walk North along X=2 to (2, 14).
5. Walk East along Row 14 to (8, 14).
6. Walk North along X=8 to (8, 10).
7. Walk East along Row 10 to (14, 10).
8. Trigger Suicune sighting.

## Tile Mechanics: Cianwood City
- FLOOR: Standard ground.
- WALL: Impassable barrier.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way barrier. Blocks DOWN movement (Y to Y+1). Allows UP and East-West movement. (Verified at (6, 46)).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump South. Impassable from the North side.

## Navigation: Landmarks
- Inner Channel Gap (X=18-19): Only terrestrial path between the Northern/Central city and the Southern Rim (Row 52).
- Southern Rim (Row 52): Clear East-West passage from X=27 to X=2.
- West Beach Highway (X=2): Clear North-South passage from Row 53 to Row 14.

## Inventory Check
- Super Repel: 5 remaining. Last applied turn 49278. (On land, not needed).
