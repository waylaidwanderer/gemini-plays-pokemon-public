# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Stop Team Rocket.
- **Secondary Goal:** Fly to Goldenrod City.
- **Next Task:** Investigate Radio Tower (Team Rocket takeover).

## Action Log
- **Status:** Leaving Goldenrod PC.
- **Correction:** Realized team is already fully healed (Cross Chop 5/5 is max PP). No need to talk to Nurse Joy.
- **Plan:** Exit PC and head North to the Radio Tower.
- **Target:** Radio Tower is likely in the NW part of the city, near the train station or arcade.

## Tile Mechanics
- **ICE:** Stepping onto this tile forces the player to slide in the current direction until they hit a WALL, OBJECT, or FLOOR tile. **Confirmed: Sliding stops on FLOOR tiles.**
- **FLOOR:** Safe to walk/stop.
- **Trap Tiles:** B1F corridors (Geodude/Voltorb/Koffing) - *Rocket Hideout*.
- **Security Cameras:** Trigger alarms/battles - *Rocket Hideout*.
