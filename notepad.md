# Red Battle Log
- Start: Turn 43634
- Pikachu (Lv81): Defeated by GNEISS.
- Espeon (Lv73): Defeated (Turn 43777).
- Snorlax (Lv75): Active. Asleep (Turn 43892). Sp.Def +6 (Maxed).

- Strategy: Use Hypnosis to sleep Snorlax, then Dream Eater. Snorlax cannot harm Haunter. Physical attackers (GORP/GNEISS) are more efficient but riskier if Snorlax wakes up. Note: Strategist recommended Curse, but XENON does not have it.
