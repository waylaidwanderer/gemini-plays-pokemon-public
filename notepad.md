# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Timestamp:** Turn 25602 (Jan 6, 2026)
- **Primary Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Immediate Task:** Reach the Northwest area of Silver Cave Outside.
- Current Location: Route 28 (0, 13). Exiting.
- Correction: The ledge at Silver Cave Outside (39, 32) BLOCKED me last time. It is likely a wall.
- Plan:
    1. Exit Left to Silver Cave Outside.
    2. Test Row 32 at x=36, 37, 38 for a valid ledge.
    3. If all fail, check for a hidden path through the trees to the East (x>39).

# Tile Mechanics & Observations
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT:** Standard one-way jumpable tiles.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Inconsistent behavior observed.
    - **Confirmed Ledge:** (39, 32) allowed jumping South.
    - **Confirmed Wall:** (6, 30) and (28, 34) blocked movement South.
    - **Strategy:** Treat as WALL unless verified otherwise.
- **Navigation Notes:**
    - The "Central" area (x=5) connects to the West path via Row 22 (re-verified via Mental Map).
    - Row 30 acts as a hard barrier across most of the map, separating the North and South sections.
