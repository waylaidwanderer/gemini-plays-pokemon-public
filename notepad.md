# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Cross the whirlpool to reach the Dragon Shrine.

# Key Mechanics & Lessons
- **Field Moves:** If 'A' interaction fails (even when facing correctly), ALWAYS fallback to Menu -> Pokemon -> [Mon] -> [Move].
- **Whirlpool:** Requires facing the whirlpool tile directly. 'A' button might be unreliable; Menu is safer.

- Status: Opening Menu to use Whirlpool (Attempt 2 with Correct Facing).
- Reason: I am now confirmed to be facing DOWN (verified by screenshots). Previous error "Can't use that here" was due to facing Up.
- Step 1: Press 'Start' to open menu.
- Step 2: Navigate to Pokemon -> Lapis -> Whirlpool.
