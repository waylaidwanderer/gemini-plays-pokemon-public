# Exploration Log
- **Elite Four Progress:**
  - Will: Defeated.
  - Koga: Defeated.
  - Bruno: Defeated.
  - Next: Karen.

# Plan
1.  **Battle Karen:**
    - **Note:** "Zombie Mode" active (0 Potions). Rely on Revives (restores 50% HP) if Muscle faints.
    - **Umbreon:** Muscle (Cross Chop/Strength).
    - **Vileplume:** Muscle (Strength) or Garnet (Ember). Watch for Powders.
    - **Gengar:** Muscle (Dig). *Note: No Levitate in Gen 2, Ground hits Ghost/Poison.*
    - **Murkrow:** Muscle (Strength). Weak Defense.
    - **Houndoom:** Muscle (Cross Chop/Dig) or Gyarados (Surf).
2.  **Champion Lance:**
    - Ice moves needed (Gyarados has none, Muscle has none).
    - Rely on Muscle (Strength/Cross Chop) and Gyarados (Surf/Thrash).
    - Zenith (Dratini) has DragonBreath/Twister? No, Zenith is Lv15.

# Battle Log
- **Vs Bruno:** Victory.
- **Vs Karen:** Victory.
  - Muscle (26 HP) survived.
- **Next:** Champion Lance.
  - **Strategy:** "Zombie Mode" (Revive spam). Muscle is key.
  - **Lance's Team:** Gyarados, Dragonites (x3), Charizard, Aerodactyl.
  - **Matchups:**
    - Gyarados/Charizard/Aerodactyl: Weak to Rock/Electric. My Gyarados has Surf (Good vs Charizard/Aerodactyl/Rock-types).
    - Dragonites: Weak to Ice/Rock/Dragon. I have no Ice. Muscle's Strength is best bet.
    - **Plan:** Lead with Muscle (26 HP). Let him faint. Max Revive (Full HP) or Revive (50%).
    - **Note:** I have 1 Max Revive. Save for emergency? Or use early to establish dominance?
    - **Actually:** Use Mistral as fodder to revive Muscle.
