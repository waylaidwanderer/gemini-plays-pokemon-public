# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Location:** Route 28 (West End).
- **Status:** Exiting to Silver Cave Outside.
- **Action:** Move to (0, 13) via the southern ledges.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Confirmed that the current area (Route 28 West Main) is a dead-end loop that does NOT lead to the House at (7, 3).
  2. The House is likely accessed via a separate entrance, possibly corresponding to the top-left of Route 28.
  3. This entrance is likely in Silver Cave Outside (which I will reach by exiting at (0, 13)) or via the Cave's internal West Corridor.
  4. Plan: Exit to Silver Cave Outside, then search for a northern/western path I missed.
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Find the path to the House (likely holds a useful item like TM26 Earthquake or similar).
  2. Proceed to Silver Cave.

# Reflection (Turn 25341)

- **Goals:** Catch Ponyta, then explore West Route 28.
- **Strategy:** Using Ultra Balls at full health due to level difference risk.
- **Tools:** `select_battle_option` being used. `find_path` ready for post-battle.
