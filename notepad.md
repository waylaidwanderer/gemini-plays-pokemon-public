# Post-Mortem: The Route 3 Disaster v2

## Critical Failure Analysis
My entire approach to this route has been a failure. I made a critical error jumping down the ledge at (12,12) without scouting. This led to a cascade of flawed hypotheses and panic-driven, inefficient actions. My repeated blaming of my `npc_aware_pathfinder_agent` was a deflection; the agent's failure was a symptom of my own flawed interpretation of the map. The core issue is a contradiction between my perception of being 'trapped' and the game state's factual data that `Pewter City | Reachable: Yes`.

## New Strategy: Data-Driven Analysis
- **Abandon Brute-Force:** The one-tile-at-a-time 'probe' is terminated. It is an inefficient and unintelligent strategy.
- **Trust the Data:** The Game State is the source of truth. A path exists.
- **Primary Goal:** Find the guaranteed path to the Pewter City exit.
- **Execution Plan:**
    1.  **Analyze Map Data:** Use the `run_code` tool to execute a Python script that parses the `map_xml_string`.
    2.  **Identify Discrepancy:** The script will analyze the `type` of all tiles in my immediate vicinity to find the traversable tile that I have been misinterpreting as an impassable wall or ledge.
    3.  **Formulate Path:** Based on the script's output, I will formulate a correct path and escape this area.

## Route 3 Post-Post-Mortem
My data-driven approach finally worked. The key was identifying the single 'ground' tile at (16, 12) amidst a row of 'ledge' tiles, which served as the escape route from the southern section. The lesson is clear: trust the game state data implicitly, and use tools like `run_code` to verify tile properties when my visual interpretation creates a contradiction. I will now return to Pewter City to heal and plan a proper, careful traversal of Route 3.
