# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Deliver Kenya to Route 31.
- **Secondary Goal:** Travel to Mahogany Town (Route 42).
- **Tertiary Goal:** Train Party to Level 30+.
- **Immediate Action:** Buy Flower Mail (x3).
  1. **Current State:** Buy Menu Open.
  2. **Action:** Scroll down to Flower Mail (usually near bottom).
  3. **Buy:** Purchase 3 units.
  4. **Next:** Equip to Kenya.
  5. **Typing Strategy:** **ALL CAPS**. Previous observation in Turn 8640 noted "DARK CAVE LEADS TO ANOTHER ROAD". My recent lowercase attempts likely caused the rejection.
- **Route Info:** Violet Mart.
- **Mail Status:** Stocking up.

## Party Status
- **Team:** Muscle (41), Garnet (28), Hematite (15), Azurite (13), Lapis (12), Mistral (13), Kenya (10).
- **Inventory:** Contains FLOWER MAIL (3 in Bag).

## Quests
- **Webster's Mail:** Delivering Kenya (Spearow) to Route 31. Recipient is the Sleeping Man (Cooltrainer) near Dark Cave.
- **Gyms:** 6 Badges. Next: Mahogany (Glacier).

## Mechanics Notes
- **Fly Map:** Navigation is list-based via `Up`/`Down`. Order: New Bark -> Cherrygrove -> Violet -> Azalea -> Goldenrod.
- **Menu Cursor:** Remember position! Always reset or verify.

### Reflection (Turn 8681)
- **Execution:** Addressed "Cursor Memory" issues by resetting via Start Menu. Debugged Fly Map navigation step-by-step.
- **Notepad:** Cleaned up obsolete typing logs. Recorded Fly Map list logic.
- **Lesson:** When blind inputs fail, STOP and verify with screen text. Do not assume standard grid navigation.
