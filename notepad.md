# Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR:** Standard traversable tile.
- **WALL:** Impassable obstacle.
- **WATER:** Traversable only with Surf.
- **TALL_GRASS:** Traversable, chance of wild encounters.
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN:** One-way movement South. Impassable from other directions.
- **LEDGE_HOP_RIGHT:** One-way movement East. Impassable from other directions.
- **LEDGE_HOP_LEFT:** One-way movement West. Impassable from other directions.
- **CUT_TREE:** Obstacle. Removable with Cut HM.
- **LADDER:** Warps to another map or floor.
- **DOOR:** Warps to another map or interior.
- **Correction:** The "Cape" tip at (50-55, 4) is walled off from the land. The only access is via the water channel at x=56.
- **Correction:** Access to the x=56 water channel is blocked on Route 25 by walls. Must access from Route 24 (Nugget Bridge) East side.
- **Plan:** Return to Route 24 -> Surf East of Bridge -> Head North to (56, 4).
- **Route 25:** Water at (42-45, 8-11) might connect to the Cape channel (x=56).
- **Plan A:** Go to (42, 12), Surf North to (42, 11), check East passage. If open, proceed to Cape.
- **Plan B:** If East passage blocked, return to Maze (West side), go to (4, 17), Surf South to Route 24 West, then Surf East under bridge.
- **Discovery:** The 'LADDER' tiles at (46-49, 8-11) are traversable while Surfing. They act like water despite their appearance/label.
- **Plan:** Surf East across the 'LADDER' tiles to reach the open water at x=50, then head North to the Cape.
