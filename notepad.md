# Strategy (HOW)
- **Earn Glacier Badge:**
  1. Exit base via B1F (27, 2).
  2. Heal at Pokemon Center.
  3. Challenge Gym Leader Pryce. Calcifer (Typhlosion) is lead for Ice-type advantage.

# Floor Connectivity (Mahogany Base)
- B1F (27, 2) <-> Mahogany Mart (7, 3) [Entrance/Exit]
- B1F (3, 14) <-> B2F (3, 14)
- B2F (27, 14) <-> B3F (27, 14)
- B3F (27, 2) <-> B2F (27, 2)
- B2F (3, 2) <-> B3F (3, 2)
- B3F (3, 6) <-> B2F (3, 6) [Access to TM46]

# Lessons Learned
- Map sections are isolated; use specific ladders to cross.
- Whirlpool requires Glacier Badge to use out of battle.
- B3F West and East sections are connected via a gap in the central wall at (18, 16).
