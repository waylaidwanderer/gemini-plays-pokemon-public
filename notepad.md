# Exploration Notes
- **Vermilion Port Passage:**
    - Multiple paths. Currently on the right side (x=15 path).
    - Exiting North to Vermilion City.
    - Ladders at x=3 seem to be a separate path.
- **Log:** Arrived in Vermilion City (12_3). Exploring.
- **Log:** Entered Vermilion City via the East path (x=28).
- **Plan:** Explore the city center. Locate Gym and Pokemon Center.
- **Observation:** Spotted a Sleeping Snorlax at (34, 8) blocking the path.
- **Log:** Found Vermilion Mart at (21, 13).
- **Log:** Path North is blocked by fences/buildings at y=11.
- **Plan:** Go around the Mart to the West (x<20) to find a path North to the Pokemon Center.
- **Log:** Navigating North via the path at x=19 to bypass the Mart.
- **Log:** Encountered another Teacher at (19, 8).
- **Plan:** Talk to her, then check the building to the North/West.
- **Log:** Heading to Gramps at (23, 6). Possible Pokemon Center nearby.
- **Observation:** Found a Machop at (26, 7) stomping the ground. Gramps is watching.
- **Log:** Talked to Gramps. He is preparing land for construction but has no money.
- **Plan:** Explore West to find the Pokemon Center (likely the building at x=19-21).
- **Log:** Approaching building at (20, 5) to check if it's the Pokemon Center.
- **Log:** Standing at Pokemon Center entrance (20, 6). Entering to heal.
- **Correction:** Entrance at (20, 5) was blocked. Trying adjacent tile (19, 5).
- **Correction:** The building at (20, 5) has NO door. It is NOT the Pokemon Center (or it's closed).
- **Plan:** Read the City Sign at (25, 3) for orientation.
- **Hypothesis:** The Pokemon Center might be elsewhere, or I need to clear an event.
