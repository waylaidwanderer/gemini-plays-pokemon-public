## Persistence Knowledge
### Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Traversable. Standard ground.
- WALL: Impassable.
- LADDER: Traversable. Vertical transition.
- WARP_CARPET: Map transition at edges.
- COUNTER: Interaction point; face it and press A.
- WATER: Requires SURF to traverse. 
- LEDGE: One-way traversal (jump down).
- GRASS: Wild Pokémon encounter zone.
- WHIRLPOOL: Requires WHIRLPOOL to clear.
- WATERFALL: Requires WATERFALL to climb.
- ICE: Causes sliding movement until an obstacle is hit.
- HOLE: Pit that causes falling to a lower floor.

### Lessons Learned
- Gengar (Ghost): Immune to Normal moves (Return).
- Dragonite/Charizard (Ghost interaction): XENON is immune to Normal moves (Hyper Beam/Slash).
- Safeguard: Prevents status conditions (SLP, PAR, etc.) and confusion from Outrage.
- Outrage: User is locked for 2-3 turns. Confusion is prevented by Safeguard.
- Party Sub-menu (Battle): [SWITCH, STATS, CANCEL].
- Party Sub-menu (Overworld): [STATS, SWITCH, ITEM, CANCEL].
- HM Sub-menu logic: HM moves appear at top. SWITCH position varies.
- Status Management: Paralysis reduces speed by 75%.

## Battle Strategy
- Objective: Defeat Dragonite #3.
- Current Plan: Revive GNEISS (Lv51) as the final backup. GNEISS has Rock moves (Rollout) which are strong against Dragonite. Calcifer will continue with Return. XENON is available for chip damage with Night Shade.
