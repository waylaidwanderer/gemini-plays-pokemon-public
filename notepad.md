- **Current Status:** In Ice Path 1F at (18, 25). Lower Floor.
- **Mechanics:** 
  - **Ice Tiles:** Player slides until hitting an obstacle or non-ice tile.
  - **Ledges:** One-way jumps. Row 18 (Cols 2, 7-12) has ledges blocking Northward return.

  - Entrance: (4, 19).
  - **Path Discovery:**
    - Jumped ledge to lower floor (Row 25).
    - Need to loop back to the start (Upper Floor).
    - **Hypothesis:** Return path is via the far West columns (0-1), which appear to be free of ledges.
  - **Plan:**
    1. Walk West to (11, 25) and continue to x=1.
    2. Walk North to Row 17/19.
    3. Restart ice puzzle at (13, 17).

# Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR:** Walkable.

# Key Log
- **Turn 16261:** Surfing on Route 44 (35,9).
- **Turn 16240:** Defeated Psychic Phil.
- **Turn 16222:** Confirmed Suicune not in Pokedex.
- **Route 44 Update:** North/East bank of 2nd lake (Zach's island) is a DEAD END (Ledges block Eastward travel).
- **Correction:** Path to Blackthorn must be via the South Path, accessible from the 1st lake (likely landing South at x=27).
- **Next Step:** Backtrack to 1st lake and explore South bank.
- **Turn 16312:** Defeated Cooltrainer Cybil. Proceeding East on South Path to Blackthorn City.
- **Turn 16322:** Defeated Cooltrainer Allen at (37,15).

- **Turn 16328:** Entered Ice Path 1F at (4,19).
- **Observation:** Spotted an Item Ball at (32, 23) in the eastern ice area, currently separated by a wall.
- **Observation:** Spotted another Item Ball at (35, 9) in the far North-East, currently unreachable from the low ground.
- **Correction:** The "South-East Path" was a dead end.
- **Hypothesis:** The way forward is likely jumping the ledge at (18, 24) to access the southern rows (25+).
