# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Standard ground. Traversable.
- WATER: Surf required. Traversable.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- WALL: Impassable ground/object.
- DOOR: Warp point. Traversable.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Ledge face. Blocks North movement.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
- BREAKABLE ROCK: Requires Rock Smash. Impassable.
- NPC: Impassable. Interact from adjacent tile.

# Strategy: Capture Suicune
- Goal: Reach the northern plateau (approx. 14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The West Beach Shortcut (Hypothesis)
- Plan:
  1. Navigate to (19, 30) and land. [IN PROGRESS]
  2. Walk to (4, 29) via Row 28 (to bypass rock at 5, 29).
  3. Jump ledge at (4, 30) to reach the beach at (4, 31).
  4. Walk North along X=2 to (2, 11).
  5. Walk East to (14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Status: Returning to land at (19, 30).
- Reasoning: The buoy maze and city paths are heavily blocked. The far west beach (X=2) appears to be a clear corridor that bypasses all obstacles and connects directly to the northern plateau.

# Verified Tile Mechanics
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN (4, 30): Confirmed one-way jump from North (4, 29) to South (4, 31).
- X=2 Corridor: Verified FLOOR from Y=49 to Y=11.
- Plateau Access: Hypothesis that X=2 connects to plateau via Row 11.
