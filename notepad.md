- Moomoo Farm: Sick Miltank needs 7 standard BERRY items.
- Section Connectivity: 4F sections connected by gaps at y=2/3 (East-Middle) and y=14 (Middle-West).

# Berry Knowledge

- To Battle: Ronald (5F North).

# Map Notes
- 5F Warps: (9,7) Ladder to 4F Middle, (9,15) Ladder to 6F.
- 4F Warps: (16, 7)/(17, 7) may be balcony exits. (13, 3) leads to 3F East.

# Swarm Events
- Yanma: Route 35 (Turn 5683).

# Strategy: Olivine Lighthouse 6F
