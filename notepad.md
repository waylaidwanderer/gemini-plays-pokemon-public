# Strategy: Rising Badge (Gym Leader Clair)
- Tactical Plan: Use Xenon's Night Shade for fixed damage. Gneiss for physical bulk and STAB Earthquake. Calcifer's Thunderpunch for neutral coverage.
- Training Goal: Level Xenon and Kimchi to 30+ in Route 45 grass.

# Strategy: Johto League Training
- Method: Switch-training. Lead with Kimchi or Xenon to share EXP, then switch to Gneiss or Calcifer for the KO.
- Efficiency: Grind in Route 45 grass (4,12)-(5,12).
- Resource Management: Return to Blackthorn PC via FLY when Xenon's Night Shade or Gneiss's Earthquake PP is depleted.
- Grinding Session 1: Started Turn #31060 (Tuesday, Jan 6, 2026).

# Progress Tracker
- Target Lv30: 21760 EXP (~4473 left for Kimchi, ~1356 left for Xenon).
- Encounter Log Summary: Donphan (Lv25/30), Geodude (Lv23), Graveler (Lv23/25/27), Gligar (Lv24), Skarmory (Lv24).

# Key NPC Locations & Gifts
- Dana (Lass): Route 38. Has a gift. (Turn #31604)

# Battle Strategies & Observations
- Night Shade: Deals fixed damage equal to user level. Perfect for grinding and bypassing high Defense. Note: Night Shade damage is fixed, but it cannot hit Normal-type Pokemon.
- Sleep Powder: "It didn't affect" message investigated. Not gender-dependent. Likely due to existing status or move-specific failure.
- Type Immunities: Ghost-types (Xenon) are immune to Normal and Fighting moves (e.g., Quick Attack, Selfdestruct).
- Type Weaknesses: Haunter (Poison/Ghost) is weak to Ground-type moves like Magnitude.
- Move Mechanics: Selfdestruct is a major threat from Graveler; Gneiss resists. Hypnosis is effective for safe switches.

# General Mechanics & Lessons
- Route 45: Ledges divide the route into vertically separated sections. Paths are one-way SOUTH. Use HM02 FLY to return to Blackthorn City.
- Fly Map: Systematic navigation required. Confirm destination name in screen text before pressing A.
- Turn #31686: Xenon Night Shade PP is low (3/15). Plan to heal after this battle or if PP runs out.
