# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
## Strategy: Western Corridor Land Route
The northern plateau (Row 10-15) is blocked by a wall/ledge at Row 15, except at the far West.
1. Land at (17, 30) from the eastern sea.
2. Walk West to (3, 22) (Gap in the X=3 wall).
3. Enter the Western Corridor (X=0-2) and walk North to Row 10.
4. Walk East along Row 10 to (14, 10) to trigger the Suicune sighting.

# Progress Notes

- Verified: (3, 22) is a gap in the X=3 wall.
- Verified: Row 26 buoy wall at X=16 blocks direct sea access to the central landing.
- SUPER REPEL is active.
- Land Route is the confirmed path to the plateau.
