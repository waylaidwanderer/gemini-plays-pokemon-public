# Current Strategy: Return to Red
- **Timestamp:** Turn 26399 (Jan 7, 2026) [Silver Cave Item Rooms]

- **Immediate Goal:** Determine if the ledge at y=4 is jumpable or if this is a dead end.
- **Plan:**
  1. Test jumping DOWN at various x-coordinates along the ledge.
  2. If jumpable, explore lower area.
  3. If not, return to Room 2 via warp (13, 3) and look for another path (e.g., Warp 11, 5).
- **Hypothesis:** This ledge must lead somewhere or contain an item.
