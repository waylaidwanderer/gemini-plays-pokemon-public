# Strategy Lessons
- Buoy Maze: The buoy spiral is the only intended path to the north plateau. Land routes are blocked by walls (X=5, X=9) and one-way ledges.
- Dead Ends: (11, 14) is a dead-end pocket; do not attempt to reach the plateau from the city beach.
- Surf Points: (19, 30) is the most efficient launch point for the buoy spiral.
