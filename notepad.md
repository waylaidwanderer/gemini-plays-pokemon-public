Tertiary Goal: Exit Mt. Moon and reach Route 4 after obtaining a fossil.

# Gameplay Notes & Strategy
## Navigation & Exploration
*   **CRITICAL:** Trust the **annotated screen** for immediate obstacles over map memory if there's a conflict.
*   The North map connection from Route 3 leads to the *lowest tier* of 'Route 4 (Before Mt. Moon)', forming a loop for upper Route 4/western Mt. Moon access.
*   When on Route 4 (Before Mt. Moon) upper tiers, navigate eastward by descending ledges.
*   **Path Validation (CRITICAL):** Rigorously verify paths generated by `dungeon_navigator_agent`, especially in complex, warp-heavy environments like Mt. Moon, by cross-referencing with map data or using manual checks for initial segments. Reduce reliance.
*   **Multi-Tile Warps:** Be consistently aware of 2-step activation (onto tile, then into boundary/direction).
*   **Mt. Moon Fossil Hunt Plan (REVISED - Turn 8264 - CLARIFIED WARP MECHANICS):**
    1.  **Objective:** Obtain a Fossil (Dome or Helix).
    2.  **Source:** The Super Nerd (ID 4, sprite MTMOONB2F_ROCKET2) at (Mt. Moon B2F, 30,12) guards the fossils. He must be *defeated* in battle. His dialogue ("If you find a fossil, give it to me and scram!") is a pre-battle taunt.
    3.  **Understanding Mt. Moon B1F & B2F Warp Connections (CRITICAL):**
        *   The warp at coordinates (22,18) on **Mt. Moon B2F** (near the isolated Rocket Grunt ID 5) leads to **Mt. Moon B1F** at (22,18) (this is B1F's entry_point 5).
        *   The warp at coordinates (22,18) on **Mt. Moon B1F** leads to **Mt. Moon B2F** at (22,18) (this is B2F's entry_point 2, being the 2nd warp in B2F's game state list). This segment contains Rocket Grunt (ID 5) at (30,18). The Super Nerd (ID 4) is at (30,12) on B2F. Need to navigate from (22,18) to (30,12) to check accessibility.
    4.  **Path to Super Nerd (ID 4) on Mt. Moon B2F:**
        a.  Currently on Mt. Moon B1F at (22,17), facing the warp at (22,18) which has Pikachu on it.
        b.  Used the warp at Mt. Moon B1F (22,18). This correctly led to Mt. Moon B2F at (22,18) (B2F's entry_point 2), not (26,10) as previously hypothesized. The (26,10) warp on B2F leads *back* to B1F.
        c.  On Mt. Moon B2F, navigated to Rocket Grunt (ID 5) at (30,18). Interaction with Rocket Grunt (ID 5) on turn 8315 resulted only in dialogue ('POKéMON lived here long before people came.') and did NOT trigger a battle or make Super Nerd (ID 4) reachable. Super Nerd (ID 4) at (30,12) remains `reachable: no`.
        d.  **New Strategy:** Since Super Nerd (ID 4) is currently unreachable, the next step is to explore the 'Reachable Unseen Tiles' on Mt. Moon B2F, as the game state indicates 'One or more undiscovered warps on this map are still hidden by unseen tiles.' This exploration may reveal a path to the Super Nerd, the fossils, or the eastern exit.
        e.  Once Super Nerd is reachable: Battle and defeat the Super Nerd.
        f.  After defeating him, two Fossils (Dome/Helix) should appear as item balls nearby. Select one.
    5.  Obtaining a fossil will likely open the path to the eastern Mt. Moon exit (Route 4).
*   **Item Acquisition:** Key items like fossils, if pick-ups, will be visible item sprites on the map and listed in the `Map Sprites` section *after the trigger event*. Do not interact with empty ground tiles expecting items.

## Battle Strategy
*   Improve precision in battle menu navigation.
*   Be mindful of type matchups and PP conservation. Internalize ROM hack type changes.
*   **Risk Assessment:** Avoid switching in Pokémon with critically low HP against opponents that can KO them.
*   **Healing Priority:** Prioritize reaching a Pokémon Center quickly if key Pokémon are critically injured.

## ROM Hack Specifics
*   **General Changes:** Old Rod (Viridian Mart), HMs forgettable/menu use, TMs repurchasable, Trade evos by level.
*   **Type Matchup Changes (CRITICAL TO MEMORIZE):** Ghost (Special) SE vs Psychic. Bug no longer SE vs Poison. Grass is 0.25x vs Poison/Flying (e.g., Zubat). Poison attacks NVE vs Zubat (Poison/Flying). Bug SE vs Poison (likely 2x, resulting in 4x vs Grass/Poison like Gloom).
*   **Stat Boosts:** Pikachu, Farfetch’d, Venomoth, Onix.
*   **Level Caps:** Misty (Starmie Lv21 -> Cap 21), Lt. Surge (Raichu Lv28 -> Player Cap 24).

## PC Interaction Notes
*   Pewter City PC is on the far right (east side) of the Pokecenter.
*   'SOMEONE's PC' for Pokémon Storage. 'Gem's PC' for Item Storage.

# Navigation Rules & Insights
*   NPCs on `navigable: false` tiles are impassable physical obstacles, even if defeated or non-battling.
*   Ledge tiles marked `navigable="true"` can be occupied (e.g., by jumping down onto them), but upward movement onto a ledge from below is prevented by game physics, even if the tile's `navigable` attribute is true. The game's movement denial takes precedence over the XML's `navigable` flag for directional traversal of ledges from below.
*   Defeated trainers may sometimes remain as physical obstacles on their tile; their tile will remain `navigable: false` in map memory.

# Dungeon Navigation Insights (NEW)
*   **Segmented Dungeons (CRITICAL):** Complex dungeons like Mt. Moon often have multiple disconnected segments on the *same floor*. Different warps/ladders are keys to these distinct areas. Systematically explore each warp from a given floor to discover all accessible sub-sections of other floors. Do not assume all parts of a lower floor are accessible from a single entry point.

# Agent Usage & Development (Further Notes - Turn 8112)
*   Prioritize manual navigation for simple paths; `dungeon_navigator_agent` (90 uses) often needs manual correction for Pikachu. Reduce reliance.
*   Consider deleting underused agents (e.g., `exploration_prioritizer_agent`, `rom_hack_mechanics_lookup_agent`) if slots are needed. Potential new agent idea: 'Exploration Prioritizer Agent' to rank unseen tiles/warps.

## NPC Interaction Rules & Key Dialogue (NEW - Turn 8113)
*   Some NPC dialogue that seems like a request or statement (e.g., Super Nerd's "If you find a fossil, give it to me and scram!") might actually be a pre-battle taunt if the NPC is an undefeated trainer blocking a path or objective. Always consider context and whether the NPC is a known trainer type.

# Agent Development & Usage (Further Notes - Turn 8162)
*   `exploration_prioritizer_agent` Limitations: The agent might fail to provide suggestions if 'Reachable Unseen Tiles' (from game state) are not marked `navigable="true"` in the map XML. Its Python script currently looks for `seen="false"` AND `navigable="true"`. Consider updating its prompt to instruct its code to also analyze tiles adjacent to `navigable="true"` tiles that are `seen="false"`, or to directly use the 'Reachable Unseen Tiles' list from game state if that's more reliable, especially in complex, segmented dungeons where XML `navigable` status might be misleading for overall reachability.

*   `dungeon_navigator_agent` (91 uses): Drastically reduce reliance, especially for complex, multi-segment navigation or when targets are known to be in separate areas. Prioritize manual pathfinding or breaking navigation into smaller, verifiable segments. Be more critical of its output.
*   **1x1 Warp Activation:** Be more consistent with 1x1 warp activation, especially considering Pikachu's position. Stepping off and then back on is the reliable method if unsure.

# Gameplay Reminders (Post-Reflection Turn 8367)
*   **Reachable Unseen Tiles List:** Always use the *current* list from the Game State Information for exploration planning. This list is dynamic and can change frequently.
*   **Navigation Goal Coordinates:** Ensure `navigation_goal_coordinates` are always confirmed `navigable: true` in the map XML or are part of the current 'Reachable Unseen Tiles' list from Game State to avoid pathing errors.

# Future Agent Ideas (Brainstorming)
*   **Boulder Puzzle Helper Agent:** Could analyze `map_xml_string` to identify boulder positions, switches, and barriers, then suggest optimal push sequences for Strength puzzles. Input: target switch/barrier. Output: sequence of boulder pushes.
*   **Objective Validator Agent:** Given a player-defined objective (e.g., 'Reach Super Nerd at X,Y'), it would check `map_xml_string` and game state to confirm if the target is currently `reachable: yes` or if its tile is `navigable: true`. Could help prevent pathing to currently impossible targets. Input: target description/coordinates. Output: validation (true/false), reason if false.
