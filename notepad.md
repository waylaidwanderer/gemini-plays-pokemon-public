# General Lessons
- Puzzle Bypass: Always explore the perimeter of a room. The Blackthorn boulder puzzle is skippable via the right-side path.
- Battle Strategy: High-level starters are essential. Fixed damage and status are vital when underleveled.
- Resource Management: Carrying zero Revives into a late-game Gym Leader battle is a critical error.
- Pathfinding: Don't assume a boulder puzzle is mandatory; explore all paths first.
