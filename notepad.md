# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Location:** Route 28 (West End).
- **Status:** Exploring West Wall.
- **Action:** Move West to (4, 6).
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Currently at (9, 6).
  2. Need to explore the far western edge of this area to verify there are no hidden paths North to the House.
  3. The map shows ledges at Row 5 blocking Northward movement, but I must confirm visually and clear unseen tiles.
  4. If no path is found, I will exit to Silver Cave Outside via (0, 13).
- **Goal:** Reach the House at (7, 3).
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. The House is likely accessible from a different map transition or a hidden path I haven't found yet.
  2. Clearing the West end is the final check for this specific area.
