# Quest Strategies
## Suicune: 'The Western Land Bridge' (Bypasses Everything)
- Discovery: The northern plateau (Suicune's spot) is connected to the western beach, which can be reached on land by navigating the far southern gap in the city walls at Y=51.
- Route:
    1. From (8, 45), walk East to (12, 45).
    2. Walk South through the ledge gap to (12, 51).
    3. Walk West through the southern gap to (2, 51).
    4. Walk North along the western edge (X=2) all the way to Y=14.
    5. Walk East to (14, 14) to reach the plateau area.
    6. Walk North to (14, 10) to reach the sighting spot.
- Fact: This is a 100% land-based route that ignores buoys, surfing, and repels. It is long but reliable.
- Preparation: Lead with XENON (Haunter).
- Start Turn: 47680 (Suicune North Beach Quest)
