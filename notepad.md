# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Timestamp:** Turn 25784 (Jan 6, 2026)
- **Primary Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Immediate Task:** Explore Silver Cave Room 1 (Northern Section).
- **Sequence:**
    1. From (4, 4), go East to (5, 4) to bypass the wall at (4, 5).
    2. Go South to (5, 6), then West to (4, 6).
    3. Jump Ledge South to (4, 8).
    4. Retrieve Item Ball at (4, 9).
    5. Loop back East to x=8 to resume North exploration.

# Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Acts as a South-facing Ledge (verified). Blocks North movement.
- **Maze Solution:** The path at (8, 18) connects the West and East sections.
- **Navigation Notes:**
    - Wall at (4, 5) blocks direct South movement.
    - Ledges at Row 7 are one-way South. Return path is via x=7 or x=8.
