# Strategy: The Suicune Pursuit
- **Time Check:** Attempting sighting since Turn #50620.
- **Objective:** Trigger Suicune sighting at (14, 10) in northern Cianwood.
- **Eusine Battle Prep:** Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25). Lead with Lv64 Calcifer.
- **Current Plan (The Surf Loop):**
  1. Move East to (27, 44).
  2. Surf at (28, 44) then South to Row 51.
  3. Move West on Row 51 to (2, 51) (Bypassing all Terrace Climbs).
  4. Move North via X=2 corridor to (2, 12).
  5. Move East on Row 12 to (14, 12), then North to (14, 10) for the sighting.
- **Verification:** X=2 corridor is clear of barriers. Row 12 is a horizontal passage at the north.

- WALL / BUOY: Impassable terrain.
- WATER: Traversable only with Surf.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump DOWN (South). Blocks North.
