# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Location:** Silver Cave Outside.
- **Status:** Searching for West Entrance.
- **Action:** Move Right to enter Route 28.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Reached (39, 31).
  2. Southbound paths at Col 38 (Wall) and Col 39 (FLOOR_UP_WALL) appear blocked.
  3. The only available path is East into Route 28.
  4. Expectation: Route 28 allows access to the blocked southern areas of Silver Cave Outside.
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Exited cave at (18, 11) (Main Entrance). 
  2. The internal West Corridor (Column 0) was inaccessible from the main area due to ledges. It likely connects to a hidden external entrance.
  3. Row 24 contains water. I will Surf West to search for land and a second cave entrance.
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.

# Tile Mechanics
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN:** One-way South.
- **LEDGE_HOP_LEFT:** One-way Left.
- **WARP_CARPET:** Step on to exit map.
- **CUT_TREE:** Obstacle unless Cut is used.
- **PIT:** Drops player to floor below.
- **LADDER:** Transitions between floors.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Walkable from South/Sides. Northbound exit is BLOCKED (Verified at 8,14). Acts as a one-way ledge preventing Northward movement.
- **BUOY:** Water boundary/Wall.

# Reflection (Turn 25132)
- **Status:** Exploring Mt. Silver Cave 1F.
- **Hygiene:** Notepad and Map Markers are up to date.
- **Goals:** Clear. Exploring North to find Red.
- **Strategy:** Testing if FLOOR_UP_WALL tiles at Row 20 are traversable from the South.
- **Tools:** Current set is sufficient.
