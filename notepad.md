# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
## Strategy: Land Bypass Route
Reach the northern plateau (14, 10) by weaving through wall gaps to the Western Corridor (X=2), which is the only land path past the Row 15 ledge.

## Execution Plan
1. Move North along X=12 to Row 33.
2. Move West along Row 33 to X=6 (gap at X=9).
3. Move North along X=6 to Row 26.
4. Move West along Row 26 to X=4 (gap at X=5).
5. Move North along X=4 to Row 22 (bypass rock at (4, 25) via (5, 25)).
6. Move West along Row 22 to X=2 (gap at X=3).
7. Move North along X=2 to Row 12.
8. Move East along Row 12 to (14, 12).
9. Move North to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.
