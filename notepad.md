# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement. Allows NORTH movement. Found at Row 34 (X=6-8), Row 46, Row 48, Row 50.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at Row 15.
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 9, 11.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
## Strategy: Ledge Bypass Route
Reach the northern plateau (14, 10) by weaving through wall gaps to the Western Corridor (X=0-2). The route avoids being trapped by FLOOR_UP_WALL ledges by crossing them from South to North.

## Execution Plan
1. Move to (12, 44) via the X=12 thoroughfare.
2. Cross to the central corridor (X=6) via the Row 44 gap at (9, 44).
3. Move North to (6, 34).
4. Cross to the Western corridor (X=4 then X=2) via the Row 34/33 gaps.
5. Move North along X=2 to Row 12.
6. Walk East to (14, 12) and North to (14, 10).
