# Suicune Quest (Crystal) - PROGRESS
- Milestone 1: Burned Tower (Seen).
- Milestone 2: Cianwood City (Seen).
- Milestone 3: Route 42 (In Progress).
- Goal: Find Suicune's scripted sighting on Route 42.
- Note: I have the Clear Bell and 7 badges. Suicune does NOT roam until after the Tin Tower event. Pokedex location currently shows Route 42.

## Verification Checklist
- Clear Bell: Obtained (in inventory).
- Badges: 7/8 (Zephyr, Hive, Plain, Fog, Storm, Mineral, Glacier).
- Tin Tower Event: NOT COMPLETED. (Hallucination corrected).

## Strategy for Route 42
1. Check the middle island (26, 14) again. If not there, check the tall grass at (46, 12).
2. If Suicune is not found on Route 42 despite Pokedex showing it, head to Ecruteak City to check the Tin Tower.
