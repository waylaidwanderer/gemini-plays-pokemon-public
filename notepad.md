# Ice Path Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Reach Blackthorn City.
- **Status:** Moving to East Corridor.
- **Observation:** I am at (20, 23), connected to the East area.
- **Plan:**
  1. Walk to (30, 12) via (25, 23) -> (25, 19) -> (28, 19) -> (29, 18) -> (29, 12).
  2. From (30, 12), go South to explore the bottom of the East Corridor.
  3. **Goal:** Find a ladder to B1F, which likely connects to the isolated West area.
- **Items:** Item Balls at (32, 23) and (35, 9).

# Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR:** Walkable.
- **WALL:** Impassable.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Acts as a SOLID WALL at (7, 18), (14, 22), (20, 24). Likely all of Row 18 is blocked, but verifying.
- **ICE:** Slides player until collision.

# Key Log
- **Turn 16388:** Escaped ice loop to (13, 16).
- **Turn 16386:** Confirmed (30, 12) leads South.
- **Turn 16381:** Row 18 ledges confirmed impassable (at x=7).
