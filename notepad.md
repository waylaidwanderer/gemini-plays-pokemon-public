# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Reach the Dragon Shrine via the East Whirlpool.

# Current Status (Turn 18311)
- **Location:** Dragon's Den B1F (26, 22).
- **Action:** Test Eastern Buoys interaction.
- **Hypothesis:** One of the buoys surrounding the player might be a Whirlpool.
- **Sequence:**
  1. `A`, `A` (Interact with (27, 22)).
  2. `Down`, `A`, `A` (Interact with (26, 23)).
- **Contingency:** If these fail (no text/effect), the barrier is impassable from here. Next step: Move North.

# Plan
1. Test East/South Buoys.
2. If interaction works -> Enter Shrine area.
3. If interaction fails -> Navigate North to (26, 20) and explore the channel.

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Obstacle. Requires HM06 + Badge.
- **Buoy:** Unbreakable barrier (likely).
- **Water Channel:** Appears to continue North from current position.

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Requires HM06 Whirlpool + Glacier Badge. 
- **Lava/Magma:** (None here).
- **Ice:** (None here).

# Lessons
- **Menu Navigation:** Always verify cursor position before committing to a sequence. Blind input leads to wrong menus (e.g., PACK instead of POKEMON).
