# Gem's Johto Adventure

## Quest: Ilex Forest Farfetch'd
- **Apprentice Hint**: "Get behind it."
- **Observed Behavior**:
  - Startle: Interacting (A button) makes it fly ~6 tiles away from the player along the forest path.
  - Noisy Tiles (Twigs): Stepping on these makes the bird turn to face the player.
  - Twig Locations: Row 31 (X=23 to 29) verified. Row 23 (X=15 to 21) likely clean.
- **Current Status**: Bird at (29, 26). Player at (28, 22). 
- Attempt 8 (T2936): Interacted from (28, 22) (Front). Bird was facing LEFT. Result: Bird flew to (29, 26).
- Strategy: Locate bird at (29, 26) and drive to clean ground or catch from behind. Avoid Row 31 twigs.

## Strategy: Catching the Bird
- **Problem**: Twig tiles prevent "behind" approach.
- **Solution**: Drive the bird to clean floor (Rows 22-30, 32-35).
- **Clean Floor Locations**: Row 22, Row 24 (mostly), Row 28 (mostly).
- **Procedure**: Approach from behind on clean floor.

## Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR**: Clean ground. Passable.
- **TWIGS**: Noisy ground (specs). Alerts bird. Verified Row 31.
- **WALL / DENSE_TREES**: Impassable.
- **HEADBUTT_TREE**: Impassable.
- **CUT_TREE**: Impassable. Requires HM01 Cut.
- **LEDGE_HOP**: One-way traversal.

## Important Locations
- **Azalea Town**:
  - Kurt's House (9, 5): special balls from Apricorns.
  - Charcoal Kiln (21, 13): Reward for quest is HM01 Cut.

## Party Status
- **Calcifer (QUILAVA)** Lv22: Lead.
- **Team**: ONIX, GEODUDE, PIDGEY, TOGEPI, EKANS.
