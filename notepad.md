# Strategy: Johto League Training
- Task: Train XENON (Haunter) and KIMCHI (Gloom) to Lv40.
- Started: Turn #32266, 2026-01-07 04:30 AM.
- Method: Exp. Share on Kimchi. Lead with Xenon (Amulet Coin).
- Training Location: Route 45 (high level Rock/Ground/Flying).

# Strategy: Rising Badge (Gym Leader Clair)
- Objective: Defeat Clair in Blackthorn Gym.
- Team Composition:
    - XENON (Haunter): Main attacker. Goal Lv40+. Use Night Shade for fixed damage.
    - KIMCHI (Gloom): Support. Goal Lv40+. Use Sleep Powder.
    - CALCIFER (Typhlosion): Heavy hitter backup.
    - GNEISS (Graveler): Tank backup.
- Detailed Plan:
    1. Grind Xenon and Kimchi to Lv40 on Route 45.
    2. Ensure Xenon has full PP for Night Shade.
    3. Use Hypnosis/Sleep Powder to manage threats.
    4. Night Shade bypasses the high special defense of Clair's Dragon-types.

# Pending Rematches / Gifts
- Arnie (Bug Catcher): Route 35. Rematch potential (Turn #32311).
- Alan (Schoolboy): Route 36. Rematch potential.
- Chad (Schoolboy): Route 38. Rematch potential.

# Lessons Learned
- Mom (New Bark Town): Does NOT heal the party in Crystal.
- Haunter Mechanics: Grounded in Gen 2 (no Levitate); extremely weak to Magnitude (Ground).
- Battle Strategy (Route 45): Switch to GNEISS (Graveler) immediately if Magnitude/Ground moves are expected.
- Fly Map: 2D snapping grid. Move cursor carefully; verify destination text before pressing A.
- Menu Navigation: Avoid mixing Pokedex/Pokemon menus. Check cursor position before batching A presses.
