# Reflection (Turn 11638)
- **Execution:** PC navigation has been clumsy. Repeatedly tried to deposit Kenya with Mail, which failed. "Move w/o Mail" also proved confusing/ineffective.
- **Lesson:** Mail MUST be removed via the Party Menu ("TAKE MAIL") before depositing a Pokémon. PC "Move w/o Mail" is unreliable or requires specific conditions.
- **Hygiene:** Map markers are good. Added "Item Storage PC" to avoid future confusion.
- **Goals:** Clear. Immediate focus is swapping Kenya for Togepi.
- **Strategy:** Pivot to manual Mail removal in Party Menu to resolve the PC deadlock.
- **Quest Info:** Rocket Uniform NOT needed (Crystal specific). Fight the Grunt at Radio Tower 2F.
- **Quest Info:** Showing Togepi to Elm awards Everstone (Side Quest).
- **Locked Door:** Underground (18, 6) needs a key. Remember this for later.
