# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Location:** Route 28 (West Edge).
- **Status:** Re-entering Silver Cave Outside.
- **Action:** Move Down to (0, 13), then Left.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. I am unexpectedly back on Route 28 at (0, 12).
  2. The pathfinding in the previous turn likely glitched or routed me back through the warp.
  3. I need to return to Silver Cave Outside (Map 19_2) to continue the search for the House entrance.
  4. Manually executing the map transition to ensure success.
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Find the path to the House (likely via NW Silver Cave Outside).
  2. Proceed to Silver Cave.
