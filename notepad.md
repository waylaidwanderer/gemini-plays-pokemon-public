## Strategy: Inner Channel Landing to Suicune
**Start Turn:** 48900 (Quest: Trigger Suicune Overworld Sighting)

Cianwood's geography is a maze of buoy walls and one-way ledges. The Northern Plateau is accessible by landing at (13, 16) via the Inner Channel.

### Step-by-Step Execution Plan
1. Use Super Repel and Surf from (27, 38). <- CURRENT TASK
2. Navigate buoy gaps: (22, 16) -> (21, 16) -> (21, 26) -> (17, 26).
3. Surf North to (17, 24), then West to (15, 24) (X=16 Gap).
4. Surf North to (15, 16), then West to land at (13, 16).
5. Walk to the plateau: (13, 16) -> (11, 16) -> (11, 14) (Gap) -> (8, 14) -> (8, 10) -> (14, 10).
6. Trigger Suicune sighting at (14, 10).

## Tile Mechanics: Cianwood City
- FLOOR: Standard ground.
- WALL: Impassable barrier.
- WATER: Surf required.
- BUOY: Impassable water barrier.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way ledge. Blocks DOWN movement. Allows UP and East-West movement. (Verified at (6, 46)).

## Navigation: Verified Gaps
- X=26 Wall: Gap at Row 10-15.
- X=22 Wall: Gap at Row 16-24.
- X=18 Wall: Gap at Row 26.
- X=16 Wall: Gap at Row 24.

## Failed Hypotheses & Lessons
- Row 8 Bypass: Blocked by BUOY at (26, 8).
- Terrestrial Row 52: Blocked by WATER at (23, 32).
- Row 21/18 Gaps (X=18): Blocked by BUOY at (18, 21) and (18, 18).

## Inventory Check
- Super Repel: 5 remaining. Applied turn 49343.
- Party: Calcifer (Lv 64) leads. Ready for Eusine.
