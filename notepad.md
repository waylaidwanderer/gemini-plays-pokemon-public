# Ice Path Strategy
- **Current State:** At Ice Path B1F (1, 6).
- **Goal:** Reach the Boulder/Pit area on the East side.
- **Observations:**
  - West Corridor (x=1) is blocked to the East by a wall until the top.
  - Path wraps around the top at Row 2/3.
- **Plan:**
  1. Walk North to (1, 4).
  2. Walk East to (2, 4), then North to (2, 2).
  3. Walk East to (3, 2) and into the main room.
  4. Locate Boulders and Pits. Determine puzzle logic.

# Map Structure
- **B1F Room:** West Corridor wraps to Top Area.
- **Features:**
  - Pits at (4, 7) and (5, 12).
  - Boulders detected at (7, 8) and (8, 9).
  - Ladder to 1F at (3, 15) (Blocked from main room).
- **Hypothesis:** Push boulders into pits to access B2F or creating a path.
- **Observation:** Found a Boulder at (7, 8).
- **Hypothesis:** This is a Strength puzzle. Pushing boulders into the pits (4, 7) and (5, 12) might be the goal, or they serve as bridges.
- **Action:** Continue exploring the room to locate all boulders and pits.
