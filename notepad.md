# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Stop Team Rocket.
- **Secondary Goal:** Investigate Radio Tower (Team Rocket takeover).
- **Navigation:** Searching Goldenrod City for the Radio Tower. Checking the building at (33, 9) next.
- **Status:** Leaving Radio Tower to find Disguise.
- **Observation:** Rocket Grunt at (31, 10) threatened "true terror" but did not initiate battle. He blocks the path.
- **Hypothesis:** I need the **Team Rocket Uniform** to trick him into moving or letting me pass.
- **Plan:** Go to the Goldenrod Underground (Entrance at 9, 5) to find the uniform.
- **Lore Note:** The uniform is usually obtained from a Rocket member in the Underground during this takeover event.
