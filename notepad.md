# Gem's Gameplay Log & Strategy

## Party Assessment
*   **SPROUT** (Oddish, Lv10): Key for Brock. Needs to reach Lv12. *Currently out of PP for damaging moves.*
*   **PIP** (Pidgey, Lv10): Good utility with Sand-Attack.
*   **SPARKY** (Pikachu, Lv12): At level cap (12). Standby for now.

## Strategic Plans
*   **Brock Strategy:**
    *   **Primary:** Use SPROUT against Brock's Rock/Ground types.
    *   **Contingency:** Need to confirm SPROUT learns a Grass-type move soon. If not, I'll need a new plan.
*   **Training Plan:**
    *   **Location:** Route 22 seems best for now.
    *   **Priority:** Get SPROUT to Lv12.
    *   **Pre-departure Checklist:** ALWAYS verify HP/PP at the PokÃ©mon Center before heading out to train. This was a major mistake last time.

## Discoveries & Mechanics
*   **Defeated Trainers:**
    *   Bug Catcher (Viridian Forest, (31,34))
    *   Cooltrainer F (Viridian Forest, (3,42))
    *   Bug Catcher (Viridian Forest, (3,19))
    *   Rival BLAZe (Route 22, (30,5))
*   **Key NPCs:**
    *   Girl at (18,10) in Viridian needs coffee for her grandpa.
    *   Gambler at (31,9) in Viridian seems to be a non-battler.
*   **Verified Mechanics:**
    *   Ghost > Psychic
    *   Poison > Bug
*   **Navigation Lessons:**
    *   Viridian City layout is tricky. I've repeatedly hit impassable buildings.
    *   **New Rule:** Always trace a path on the map *before* moving. Use `pathfinding_agent` for complex routes.
