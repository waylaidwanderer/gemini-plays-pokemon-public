# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Investigate Mahogany Town (Radio Signal).
- **Secondary Goal:** Find Lance in Mahogany Town.
- **Navigation:** Team Rocket Hideout B1F - Disable Security System.

## Quest Log
- **Lake of Rage:** Caught Red Gyarados. Met Lance.
- **Mahogany Town:** In Rocket Hideout.

## Team Management
- **Party:** Muscle (43), Garnet (28), Lapis (12), Mistral (13), Kenya (11), Belladonna (5).

## Team Rocket Hideout B1F Mechanics
- **Security:** Persian Statues are cameras.
    - Camera at (6, 1) watches Row 2.
    - Camera at (24, 5) likely watches Row 5.
    - Alarm triggers infinite battles.
- **Secret Switch:**
    - **CRITICAL DISCOVERY:** Map Data lists 'TeamRocketBaseB1FSecretSwitch' at **(19, 11)**.
    - This is the objective. No need to check random statues.
- **Navigation Plan:**
    - Confirmed Switch at (19, 11).
    - Scientist at (18, 12) blocks direct East access on Row 12.
    - **Strategy:** Go East on Row 11 to (15, 11), then South to Row 13, then East to (19, 13), then North to (19, 12).
    - **Expectation:** Crossing Row 12 at (15, 12) or (16, 12) may trigger Scientist battle.
    - After switch, check Item Ball at (21, 12).

## Lessons Learned
- **Check Map Data:** Always review 'Map Events -> Background Objects' for named objectives (like Switches) before searching blindly.
- **Persian Statues:** They are cameras, not necessarily switches. The switch is a separate object.
- Route Update: Moving West to (7, 9), then South through gap at (7, 10) to reach the lower section (Row 12).
- Anticipating battle with Scientist at (18, 12) when returning East.
## Global Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WARP_CARPET: Map transition.
- STAIRS: Change floor.
- Defeated Scientist Jed.
- Plan: Navigate to (19, 12), face Up, and activate the Secret Switch at (19, 11).
- Then collect items and explore remaining warps.
- Switch activated! Security system should be disabled.
- Next: Collect Item Ball at (21, 12), then backtrack to West Side to investigate Warp at (5, 15).
- Collected Guard Spec at (21, 12).
- Plan: Backtrack to West Side via Row 11 to investigate Warp at (5, 15).
- Navigation Correction: Path blocked by Scientist at (16, 12).
- Plan: Go around via Row 11.
- Route: (17, 12) -> (17, 11) -> West to (7, 11) -> North to (7, 9) -> East to (19, 9) -> North to (19, 7) -> West to (9, 7) -> North to (9, 4) -> West to (5, 3) -> South to (5, 15).
- Goal: Reach Warp at (5, 15).
- Moving to West side.
- Note: Rocket Grunt at (4, 4) (previously thought (2, 4)). He taunted about traps.
- Plan: Interact/Battle Grunt at (4, 4), then move South to Warp at (5, 15).
- Target: Warp at (5, 15).
- Battle with Trap Geodude ended.
- Plan: Check Ladder at (3, 14) first (less likely to be a reset trap than the Warp Panel).
- Then check Warp Panel at (5, 15).
- Muscle HP: 106/144. OK.
- Observation: Trap tiles found at (5, 8), (5, 10), (5, 12).
- Hypothesis: Traps are placed every 2 tiles along Column 5. Expect another trap at (5, 14).
- Plan: Push through potential trap at (5, 14) to reach Ladder at (3, 14).
