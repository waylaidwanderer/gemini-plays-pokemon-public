## Strategy & Lessons
- **Quest Item Logic:** Do not alter quest items (e.g., mail messages) unless necessary. Original attributes often matter.
- **Fly Map:** List-based `Up`/`Down`. Order: New Bark -> Cherrygrove -> Violet -> Azalea -> Goldenrod.
- **Menu Cursor:** Always verify position.
- **Negative Results:** Mark NPCs with "Generic Text" or "Wrong Recipient" to avoid re-checking.
