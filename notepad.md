# Suicune Quest Strategy: 'The Island Bypass'
- Goal: Reach Suicune at (7, 4).
- Fact: Northern water is isolated from southern/eastern water by buoy walls.
- Solution: Sail south to the land bridge at Y=30, walk across to the western channel, then sail north and land on the north beach.
- Route:
    1. From (23, 16), sail Down to (23, 30).
    2. Sail Left to (20, 30) and land at (19, 30).
    3. Walk West across the land bridge to (15, 30).
    4. Face Up and Surf into (15, 29).
    5. Sail North in the western channel to (15, 19).
    6. Sail West and land at (4, 19).
    7. Walk to (14, 10) and then (7, 4).
- Preparation: Lead with XENON (Haunter) for Hypnosis. Be ready for Eusine.
- Status: At (12, 28). Abandoned Surfing plan in favor of the walking route along the western beach.
- Attempt 1 (Triple Gap Loop): Hallucinated/Incorrect.
- Attempt 2 (Island Bypass - Surf): Possible, but walking is more verified.
- Attempt 3 (Island Bypass - Walk): Walking along the western sand/beach to avoid buoy walls.
- Route (Walking):
    1. From (12, 28), move Left to (11, 28).
    2. Move Up to (11, 26) (bypassing the rock at 10, 27).
    3. Move Left to (9, 26).
    4. Move Up to (9, 19).
    5. Move Left to (5, 19) -> (5, 18) -> (2, 18).
    6. Move North along the far west edge to (2, 14) -> (14, 10).
- Preparation: Lead with XENON (Haunter) for Hypnosis. Be ready for Eusine.
- Note: (10, 27) is a ROCK. (4, 19) is a ROCK. (8, 24) is a Sign. Path adjusted to bypass these.
