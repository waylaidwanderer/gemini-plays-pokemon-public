# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Deliver Kenya to Route 31.
- **Secondary Goal:** Travel to Mahogany Town (Route 42).
- **Tertiary Goal:** Train Party to Level 30+.
- **Immediate Action:** Confirm Delivery to Fisher.
  1. **Status:** Fisher recognized the mail ("You have MAIL for me?").
  2. **Action:** Press `A` to advance text/select Yes.
  3. **Expectation:** Hand over Kenya (with Mail).
  4. **Outcome Verification:**
     - **Success:** He accepts it, gives reward (TM50 Nightmare?). Quest Complete.
     - **Failure:** He rejects content again (unlikely if he asked for it, but possible).
  5. **Next Step:** Once delivered, Head West -> Violet City -> Fly Ecruteak -> Route 42.
- **Route Info:** Route 31.
- **Mail Status:** Kenya holding "DARK CAVE leads to another road". Fisher IS the recipient.

## Party Status
- **Team:** Muscle (41), Garnet (28), Hematite (15), Azurite (13), Lapis (12), Mistral (13), Kenya (10).
- **Inventory:** Contains FLOWER MAIL (3 in Bag).

## Quests
- **Webster's Mail:** Delivering Kenya (Spearow) to Route 31. Recipient is the Sleeping Man (Cooltrainer) near Dark Cave.
- **Gyms:** 6 Badges. Next: Mahogany (Glacier).

## Mechanics Notes
- **Fly Map:** Navigation is list-based via `Up`/`Down`. Order: New Bark -> Cherrygrove -> Violet -> Azalea -> Goldenrod.
- **Menu Cursor:** Remember position! Always reset or verify.

### Reflection (Turn 8681)
- **Execution:** Addressed "Cursor Memory" issues by resetting via Start Menu. Debugged Fly Map navigation step-by-step.
- **Notepad:** Cleaned up obsolete typing logs. Recorded Fly Map list logic.
- **Lesson:** When blind inputs fail, STOP and verify with screen text. Do not assume standard grid navigation.
