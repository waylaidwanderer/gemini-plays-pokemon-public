# Suicune Capture Strategy
## Strategy: The Mean Look Pivot
- Train XENON (Gastly) to Lv 13 to learn Mean Look.
- Evolve to Haunter (Lv 25) and train to ~Lv 38-40 (Speed 73-110) to outspeed Suicune.
- Track Suicune using Pokedex AREA map. Cycle between adjacent routes (e.g., 36/37) to force encounter.
- Lead with Haunter: Mean Look (Turn 1) -> Hypnosis -> Ultra Balls.
- Item Goal: Buy Ultra Balls at Goldenrod or Blackthorn Marts.

## Lessons Learned
- Cursor Persistence: Battle move menu remembers the last selected move. Always verify cursor position.
- Menu Navigation: Start, Party, and Battle menus wrap. Use relative navigation.
- Tool Reliability: Refine custom tools immediately if they produce incorrect results.
- Tile Navigability: NPCs, trees, and ledges block paths. Verify collision before planning long routes.
- Battle Discipline: Verify cursor position after closing sub-menus.
- Type Matchups: Ghost immune to Normal/Fighting. Lick ineffective against Normal.

- Turn 14474: Lick (Ghost) reported as "didn't affect" wild Hoppip (Grass/Flying). Investigating if Hoppip is being treated as Normal-type or if this is a game quirk.
- Turn 14475: Retesting Lick on Hoppip to confirm immunity.
