# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Navigation Notes
- **Location**: Goldenrod City (South-West).
- **Goal**: Escape the SW Quadrant.
- **Current Action**: Analyzing Map Topology via Code.
- **Problem**: I appear to be trapped in a region bounded by Rows 30-32 (South), Column 9 (East), and Row 21 (North). I need to find the specific tile that bridges this area to the rest of the city.
- **Hypothesis**: There is a narrow path I missed, possibly obscured by "unseen" tiles or misidentified walls.

### Resource Alert
- **Pokeballs**: 10 Poké Balls, 1 Lure Ball.

- **Pokemon Center**: (4, 29).
- **Game Corner**: (20, 29).
