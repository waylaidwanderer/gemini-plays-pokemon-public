# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement (acting as a ledge). Passable from SOUTH to NORTH.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at Row 15 (X=3-17).
- ROCK: Smashable rocks act as WALLs.
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- Started: Turn 49630
## Strategy: Definitive Great Southern Loop
Reach (14, 10) by bypassing all internal obstacles via the far southern and western corridors.
1. Move West to (12, 33).
2. Move South along X=12 to (12, 47).
3. Move West along Row 47 to (10, 47).
4. Move South along X=10 to (10, 51) (passing through ledge gap at 10, 50).
5. Move West along Row 51 to (2, 51) (The Western Highway).
6. Move North along X=2 corridor to (2, 14).
7. Move East along Row 14 to (14, 14).
8. Move North to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

# Progress Notes
