# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Reach the Dragon Shrine via the West Whirlpool.

# Current Status (Turn 18314)
- **Location:** Dragon's Den B1F (20, 10).
- **Action:** Surf West to the West Channel.
- **Reasoning:** 
    - Landing at (20, 9) leads back to the entrance ladder (20, 3).
    - The East Channel (x > 21) led to a dead end at row 23 (Buoys/Whirlpool that didn't work).
    - The Mental Map shows a "Whirlpool" marker at (15, 23).
    - To reach (15, 23), I must explore the West Channel (x < 15).
    - Row 10 is open water connecting East and West.
    - Row 12 has a gap in the Buoys on the West side (x=12, 13, 14 are WATER).
- **Goal:** Reach the West Channel and navigate South to the Whirlpool at (15, 23).

# Plan
1. Navigate West to (12, 10).
2. Navigate South through the gap at Row 12.
3. Continue South to finding the Whirlpool at (15, 23).
4. Interact with Whirlpool at (15, 23).
