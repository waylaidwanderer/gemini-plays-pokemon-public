# Strategic Plan: Mt. Silver & Red
- **Strategy (The HOW):**
    1. Systematic search: Use `find_reachable_unseen_tiles` and Surf to reveal SilverCaveRoom2.
    2. Waterfall Exploration: Swap ICARUS for LAPIS (Poliwag) to climb waterfalls in Room 2.
    3. Target: Reach the warp at (13, 21) using Waterfall.
- Grinding Start: Turn #43530. Target Lv 75+.

# Progress Tracking
- Badges: 16/16.
- Mt. Silver Access: Unlocked.
- Inventory: 18/20 slots used (Items). Note: Item list in bag is NOT alphabetical.

# Tile Mechanics (Global Reference)
- FLOOR: Walkable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Requires Surf.
- TALL_GRASS: Wild encounters.
- DOOR/WARP: Map transitions.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks entry from the North (Verified Turn #43532). Hypothesis: Also blocks Northward exit.
- LEDGE_HOP: One-way movement.

# Area Records: Silver Cave Room 2 (3_75)
- Warp to Room 1: (17, 31).
- Warp to ?: (13, 21).
- Warp to ?: (11, 5).
- Water: (13, 30), (13, 31), (12, 14)-(21, 14).
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Row 16, Row 32.

# Team Goals & Battle Prep
- Grind team to Lv 75+ (currently Lv 12-64).
- Replace ICARUS (Lv19) with LAPIS for Waterfall.
- Evolve KIMCHI (Gloom) using Sun Stone or Leaf Stone.
- Lead with GNEISS (Graveler) vs Pikachu (uses Earthquake).
- Teach GORP (Snorlax) Shadow Ball (TM02) vs Red's Espeon.
- Use XENON (Haunter) for Curse vs Red's Snorlax.

# Surf Strategy
- GORP (Snorlax) learned Surf (Turn 43469).
- Navigation Analysis: Pond at (10-13, 30-31) connects to Row 27 via Waterfalls at (10-11, 28-29). Requires HM07 Waterfall to progress North from this pond.
- Strategy: Explore top section (Row 5-11) of Room 2 by land via Row 17 corridor (X=11-20).
