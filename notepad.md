# Suicune Capture Strategy (Pokemon Crystal)
## Primary Goal: Capture Suicune (Roamer)
- Status: Roaming (Confirmed via Pokedex dot and Tin Tower event history).
- Location: Route 42 (Current).
- Lead: XENON (Gastly, Lv18) - Speed: 36.
- Strategy: Repel Trick in Route 42 tall grass.
- **CRITICAL**: Suicune will flee immediately. Mean Look is required on Turn 1.
- Note: If Suicune is faster than 36 Speed, it will flee before Mean Look can be used.

## Repel Trick Mechanics
- Effective Level Range: Lead Pokémon must be higher level than the highest local wild Pokémon (Lv17 on Route 42) but lower level than the Roamer (Lv40).
- Lead: XENON (Gastly, Lv18) is perfect.
- Requirement: Super Repels (¥500).
