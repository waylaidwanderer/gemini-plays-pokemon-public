# Suicune Quest
- Objective: Catch Suicune.
- Sighting Progress:
    1. Burned Tower (DONE)
    2. Cianwood City (DONE - Eusine defeated at Turn 41111)
    3. Route 42 (Mahogany side) - PENDING
    4. Kanto Route 25 (Cerulean Cape) - PENDING
- Strategy: Visit sighting spots in order. Then Tin Tower.
- Items: Clear Bell (HAVE IT).
- Started tracking: Turn 46801

# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard walkable ground.
- WATER: Traversable only while Surfing.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable from the NORTH. Verified at (23, 46).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Impassable from the NORTH (can only jump SOUTH).

# Map Insights (Cianwood)
- Divided by internal walls. Use Row 51 to switch strips.
- X=19, X=18, X=2 are long north-south corridors.
- Gap in buoy wall at (22, 8).

# Pokedex / Party Planning
- Missing Suicune.
- Need to check Roaming Beasts (Raikou/Entei) progress later.

# Lessons Learned
- Eusine battle confirms sighting completion.
- Buoy walls are highly restrictive; land routes often safer.

# Suicune sighting on Route 42 Hypothesis
- Hypothesis: Interacting with the area at (26, 15) triggers the third sighting.
- Test: Navigate to (26, 15) and observe if Suicune appears.
- Conclusion: DENIED (Walking through (26, 15) did not trigger the event).
- New Hypothesis: The sighting trigger is further east on Route 42 or near the water.
- Test: Walk/Surf east towards Mahogany Town and observe.
- Conclusion: PENDING
