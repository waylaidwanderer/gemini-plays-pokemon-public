# Strategy: The Suicune Pursuit
- **Objective:** Trigger Suicune sighting at (14, 10) in northern Cianwood City.
- **Eusine Battle Prep:** Be prepared for a battle immediately after Suicune bolts.
  - **Eusine's Roster:** Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25).
  - **Strategy:** Lead with Lv64 Calcifer (Typhlosion). Sweep with Flamethrower or Thunderpunch for a clean sweep.
- **Navigation Plan (Surf Route):**
  1. Surf at (12, 28) to enter the water.
  2. Navigate around the buoy barriers (Gap at Row 24/25, X=16).
  3. Surf East to X=25 to bypass the Row 15 wall.
  4. Surf North to Row 10.
  5. Surf West and land at the northern plateau (e.g., at 16, 10).
  6. Approach (14, 10) to trigger the event.

# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard traversable terrain.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable terrain.
- WATER: Traversable only with Surf.
- DOOR / WARP_CARPET: Map transition points.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Allows jumping down (South) but blocks movement from the opposite direction (North).
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Terrace edges. (6, 46) allows climbing West onto the terrace.
- ROCK (Object): Blocks movement; can be cleared with Rock Smash. Respawns upon map transition.

# Lessons Learned
- **Cianwood Pathing:** (11, 15) leads to a dead-end pocket at (11, 14). Do not use for northern access.
- **Respawn Logic:** Overworld rocks (like the one at 5, 29) respawn when leaving and re-entering the map.
- **Poke Seer's House:** (5, 17) is a regular interior, not a shortcut to the north.
