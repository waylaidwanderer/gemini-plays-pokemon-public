# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
- **Start Turn:** 49885
- **Current Status:** Navigating to the southern clearway (Row 51) via the X=10 and X=7 gaps.

## Active Strategy: The Great Southern Loop (Row 51)
The northern plateau (14, 10) is accessible via the western coastal highway (X=2). This requires a long loop to bypass elevation traps.

### Execution Plan
1. Central Passage: Walk to (6, 33), then east to (10, 33). (In Progress)
2. Terrace Descent: Walk south through the (10, 34) gap to (10, 44).
3. South-West Pivot: Walk west to (7, 44), then south through the (7, 48) and (7, 50) gaps to (7, 51).
4. Western Crossing: Walk west along Row 51 to (2, 51).
5. Coastal Ascent: Walk north along X=2 to Row 12.
6. Final Approach: Walk east along Row 12 to (14, 12) and north to Suicune at (14, 10).

## Verified Mechanics
- Row 51: Completely clear from X=2 to X=24.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL blocks DOWN movement. Gaps identified at (10, 34), (7, 48), (7, 50).
- X=2 Highway: Clear path from Row 51 to Row 12.

## Battle Plan: Eusine
- Expected Team: Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25).
- Lead: Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion).
- Strategy: Flamethrower sweep.

## Failed Hypotheses
- Hypothesis 1: Land access via X=11 (blocked by Row 30 wall).
- Hypothesis 2: Land access via X=6 (blocked by Row 34 elevation trap).
- Hypothesis 3: Cut tree at (11, 13) (fake tree).

## Map Markers
- (4, 19), (4, 25), (10, 27), (5, 29), (8, 16), (9, 17): ROCK objects.
- (14, 10): Suicune sighting point.
