# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Stop Team Rocket.
- **Secondary Goal:** Investigate Radio Tower (Team Rocket takeover).
- **Navigation:** Searching Goldenrod City for the Radio Tower. Checking the building at (33, 9) next.
- **Status:** Finishing Underground check, then returning to Radio Tower.
- **Info:** QUEST KNOWLEDGE AGENT CONFIRMED: No Rocket Uniform in Crystal.
- **Plan:**
    1. Verify PokéManiac Donald at (2, 6) is defeated.
    2. Exit Underground via South or North entrance.
    3. Return to Radio Tower.
    4. Confront the Grunt at the stairs again. Try walking *into* him or checking all angles.
- **Observations:**
    - Super Nerd Teru at (6, 9) is defeated (confirmed by dialogue).
    - "True Terror" Grunt at Radio Tower likely just needs persistence or correct interaction.
    - Locked door at (18, 6) requires key (likely Basement Key from later).
