# Current Plan - Viridian Forest Exploration
*   **Objective:** Explore Viridian Forest for trainers to acquire funds and EXP.
*   **Reason:** Accidentally re-entered Viridian Forest while attempting to explore Route 2. This area still offers opportunities for progress.
*   **Status:** Just defeated a wild Caterpie. Continuing south from (2,12).

# Lessons Learned - Pewter Navigation & Strategy
*   **Youngster Escort Event (Route 3 Blocker):** The Youngster (ID 5, trigger near (36,17)) is a major recurring obstacle, frequently resetting progress towards the east exit. After 8 failed attempts, Route 3 is considered temporarily inaccessible. I MUST AVOID REPEATING THIS FAILED STRATEGY.
*   **Accurate Self-Location:** CRITICAL. I have repeatedly misidentified my current position, leading to flawed pathing and WKG errors. Must always verify against Game State Information.
*   **Adaptability:** Must abandon objectives that prove consistently unachievable after a few (e.g., 3-4) attempts. Do not persist with failing strategies.
*   **Map Awareness:** Continuously reinforce mental model of the current map, especially locations of known persistent obstacles and dynamic event triggers.
*   **Path Validation:** While `move_validator_agent` is useful, over-reliance on it for simple paths is inefficient. For complex paths from `map_analyzer_agent`, validate in segments.

# Known Pathing Obstacles in Pewter City
*   (19,19), (19,21), (18,18), (5,22), (17,22), (13,17), (13,16) - Impassable tiles.
*   Cool Trainer F at (9,16) blocks passage on Y=16 unless approached correctly.
*   Gym Sign at (12,18) - Impassable background object.
*   Police Notice Sign at (34,20) - Impassable building facade.

# Agent Usage Plan & Review Notes
*   **`map_analyzer_agent`:** Primary tool for pathfinding. Review its output and validate paths in segments.
*   **`move_validator_agent`:** Use for genuinely complex, risky, or unclear path segments. Note: Has had system errors.
*   **`exploration_planner_agent`:** Currently unreliable. Avoid or review its prompt for improvements before further use.
*   **`scripted_event_tracker_agent`:** High usage, but effectiveness against Youngster event is questionable. Need to better integrate warnings or review agent logic.
*   Ensure agents with `agent_can_run_code: true` are NOT fed `map_xml_string` or `world_knowledge_graph_json_string` as direct inputs.

# Game Mechanics & Strategy Notes
*   **Ledge Mechanics:** One-way (downwards only).
*   **Movement:** 1st press TURNS *and* MOVES. Pikachu: 1st press turns, 2nd moves if moving *into* his tile and not facing him.
*   **Level Cap:** 0 badges = Lv12.
*   **Map Marker Legend:** üí• (Event Trigger), üéØ (Key Nav Point), ‚ùó (Risky Zone/Obstacle), üíÅ (Event NPCs), ‚ò†Ô∏è (Defeated), üèõÔ∏è (Building), üìç (Path Start), üß± (Impassable), üö™ (Used Warp), ‚ÑπÔ∏è (Info NPC).

# Party Status
*   SPBARKY (PIKACHU): Lv12 (39/39 HP, EXP: 1728) (Capped) | Moves: THUNDERSHOCK (30 PP), TAIL WHIP (30 PP), QUICK ATTACK (30 PP), THUNDER WAVE (19 PP)
*   FLAREE (VULPIX): Lv8 (21/26 HP, EXP: 718) | Moves: EMBER (23 PP), TAIL WHIP (30 PP), QUICK ATTACK (30 PP)
*   ODDISH (ODDISH): Lv12 (37/37 HP, EXP: 973) (Capped) | Moves: TACKLE (35 PP), POISONPOWDER (35 PP), LEECH SEED (10 PP)
*   BIRBY (PIDGEY): Lv7 (24/24 HP, EXP: 236) | Moves: GUST (35 PP), SAND-ATTACK (15 PP)

# World Knowledge Graph (WKG) Management
*   Verify current location and that a map transition has *just occurred* before adding edges. Nodes for known exits can be added pre-transition.

# Pewter City - Route 3 Attempts Summary (Abandoned Objective)
*   Attempted to reach Route 3 eight times. All attempts were ultimately blocked by the Youngster escort event or by impassable terrain discovered mid-path. The eastern exit is currently considered too unreliable to pursue for funds. Pivoting to Route 2 exploration.

# Route 2 Exploration Notes
*   The warp at (13,10) is blocked by a cuttable tree (likely at (6,11)) and is inaccessible without HM Cut.

# EXP Tracking & Observations (Post-Critique)
*   **Flaree (Vulpix):** After defeating wild Caterpie (Lv4) in Viridian Forest (Turn 5820), Flaree gained 14 EXP. Old EXP: 718. New EXP: 732. Still Lv8.
*   **SPBARKY (Pikachu):** Game displayed 'SPBARKY gained 14 EXP. Points!' after Caterpie battle (Turn 5820). However, SPBARKY is Lv12 (current cap: 12). Verified EXP value before (1728) and after (1728) the battle; no actual EXP was gained, confirming the rule.

# Route 2 Exploration Notes
*   The warp at (13,10) is blocked by a cuttable tree (likely at (6,11)) and is inaccessible without HM Cut. Accessing the northern part of Route 2 towards Pewter City will likely require HM Cut for the tree at (13,53) or another cuttable tree that blocks the path.
