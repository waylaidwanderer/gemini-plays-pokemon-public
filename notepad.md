    - **Key Locations:** Pokemon Center (23, 43), Pharmacy (15, 47), Lugia House (15, 37), Mania's House (17, 41), Poke Seer (5, 17).
    - **Events:** Defeated Eusine (Suicune fled). Obtained SecretPotion.
    - **Exploration:** Smashed rocks at (4,25), (4,19), (8,16), (10,27). Surfing North to find Gym.

## Battle Log
- **Blackbelt Yoshi (Hitmonlee):** Defeated.
- **Blackbelt Lao (Hitmonchan):** Defeated.
- **Blocked Paths:** (4, 19) South is blocked by wall/ledge. (4, 29) South is blocked by wall/ledge (4, 30).
- **Plan:** Western area access seems to be from the North (North of Suicune spot). Heading back to (10, 27) and then North to (10, 14).
- **Exploration Update:** Surfing East/North from the beach at (13, 16) is blocked by rocks and buoys. The "channel" at Col 18 is a dead end.
- **New Hypothesis:** The Gym is accessible by going North from the smashed rock location at (4, 19), passing to the left of the Poke Seer's house. I previously jumped South from there, but North seems unexplored.
- **Investigation:** (10, 14) (Suicune spot) appears to be a dead end.
