# Exploration Log
- **Elite Four Progress:**
  - Will: Defeated.
  - Koga: Defeated.
  - Bruno: Defeated.
  - Next: Karen.

# Plan
1.  **Champion Lance:**
    - **Lead:** Muscle (26 HP). Sacrificial lead.
    - **Matchup Reality Check:**
      - Lance's team is ALL Flying-types (Gyarados, Dragonites, Charizard, Aerodactyl).
      - **Fighting (Cross Chop) is Not Very Effective (0.5x)** on all except Aerodactyl (Neutral).
      - **Ground (Dig) is IMMUNE (0x)** on all.
      - **Normal (Strength) is Neutral (1.0x)** on all except Aerodactyl (Resisted).
    - **Strategy:** Spam **Strength**. It is my most reliable damage source (80 BP + STAB > 50 BP effective Cross Chop).
    - **Aerodactyl:** Use Gyarados (Surf) or Muscle (Cross Chop - Neutral).
    - **Zombie Mode:** Revive Muscle repeatedly. Strength spam to win.

# Battle Log
- **Vs Bruno:** Victory.
- **Vs Karen:** Victory.
- **Next:** Champion Lance.
- **Vs Lance:** Battle starting.
- **Matchup Correction:**
  - **Strength (Normal):** Neutral vs Gyarados/Dragonite/Charizard. Resisted by Aerodactyl (Rock).
  - **Cross Chop (Fighting):** Resisted by Gyarados/Dragonite/Charizard. Neutral vs Aerodactyl.
- **Plan:**
  - **General:** Strength (120 Power).
  - **Vs Aerodactyl:** Cross Chop (150 Power).
  - **Lead:** Muscle (26 HP). Expecting to faint quickly.
- **Turn 19352:** Muscle fainted to Hyper Beam.
- **Mechanic:** In Gen 2, Hyper Beam requires recharge even on KO.
- **Opportunity:** Lance's Gyarados cannot move next turn.
- **Plan:** Send in Mistral (Sacrifice). Use turn to Revive Muscle safely. Then Mistral faints -> Muscle returns.
- **Turn 19355:** In Pack menu. Scrolling down to find Revives.
- **Status:** Mistral active (Fodder). Gyarados recharging (free turn).
- **Goal:** Revive Muscle.
- **Turn 19358:** Selecting Revive (Down -> A).
- **Note:** Gyarados is recharging this turn, so Mistral is safe.
- **Next:** Confirm 'USE' and select Muscle.
- **Turn 19359:** Cursor on CANCEL. Moving Up x5 to select REVIVE.
- **Visual Confirmation:** REVIVE is visible at top of list in screenshot.
- **Action:** Select REVIVE -> Use on Muscle.
- **Note:** Gyarados recharge confirmed (Turn 19352 Hyper Beam). Mistral safe.
- **Turn 19359:** Executing Revive Use (A -> USE -> A).
- **Status:** Mistral is safe (Gyarados recharging).
- **Next:** Select Muscle in Party Menu.
- **Turn 19361:** Selecting Muscle (Slot 1) with Revive.
- **Action:** Up x5 -> A.
- **Next:** Confirm revitalization, exit menu, sacrifice Mistral.
- **Turn 19362:** Confirmed Revive on Muscle (A).
- **Outcome:** Muscle revived (105 HP). Gyarados recharging.
- **Next:** Clear text, let turn end. Mistral stays in to be sacrificed next turn.
- **Turn 19364:** Menu closed. Cursor on PACK.
- **Action:** Select FIGHT -> Quick Attack.
- **Reasoning:** Gyarados is recharging (free turn). Mistral gets a free hit (negligible damage) to pass the turn.
- **Next Turn:** Gyarados will likely KO Mistral. This gives Muscle a safe switch-in.
- **Turn 19365:** Mistral uses Quick Attack.
- **Expectation:** Gyarados recharges (unable to move). Mistral survives this turn.
- **Next:** Gyarados attacks Mistral (likely KO). Muscle switches in safely.
- **Turn 19369:** Switching to Gyarados (Lv35).
- **Reasoning:** Taking advantage of opponent's recharge turn to switch in Gyarados freely.
- **Strategy:** Use Thrash/Bite with Gyarados. If Gyarados faints, switch Muscle back in.
- **Turn 19370:** Completing switch to Gyarados (A -> SHIFT).
- **Context:** Previous inputs truncated. Cursor currently on Gyarados.
- **Next:** Gyarados enters battle. Use Thrash.
- **Turn 19371:** Switch confirmed. Gyarados (Lv35) enters.
- **Matchup:** My Gyarados vs Lance's Gyarados.
- **Plan:** Use Thrash. Physical damage vs Special defense heavy opponent.
- **Reminder (Post-Battle):** Mark warps at (4,1) and (5,1). Immediate priority.
- **Turn 19372:** Lance's Gyarados recharging. Free turn.
- **Action:** Use Thrash (Slot 1).
- **Expectation:** Significant damage. Gyarados locked into Thrash.
- **Turn 19373:** Recharge turn consumed by switch.
- **Current State:** Fresh turn. Lance's Gyarados is active.
- **Action:** Fight -> Thrash.
- **Expectation:** Lance outspeeds and KOs my Gyarados (24 HP).
- **Result:** Free switch to Muscle (105 HP).
- **If I survive:** Bonus damage.
- **Turn 19374:** My Gyarados (QAAGMAQNJW) defeated Lance's Gyarados! Muscle grew to Lv65.
- **Incoming:** Dragonite (Likely Lv47).
- **Decision:** Switch to Muscle (109/215 HP).
- **Reasoning:** Dragonite resists Water/Grass/Fire/Fighting. Strength (Normal) is Neutral. Muscle is best tank.
- **Turn 19375:** Navigating Party Menu.
- **Action:** Switch from Gyarados (Slot 3) to Muscle (Slot 1).
- **Input:** Up, Up, A.
- **Reasoning:** Muscle (Lv65) is the only one who can stand up to Dragonite. Strength is neutral damage. Sneasel lacks Ice moves.
- **Matchup:** Muscle vs Dragonite. Watch out for Thunder Wave/Hyper Beam.
