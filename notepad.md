# Suicune Strategy (Crystal Version)
- **Mechanics Check**: In Crystal, Suicune has fixed overworld sprite locations (Cianwood North, Route 42 island, etc.) and is NOT a random grass encounter until the final stationary battle at Tin Tower. Boundary cycling does NOT work for Suicune.
- **Current Objective**: Interact with Suicune sprite on the Route 42 island (middle).
- **Battle Plan**:
    - Lead: XENON (Gastly, Lv21).
    - Turn 1: MEAN LOOK.
    - Speed Concern: Suicune (Lv40) will outspeed XENON (Lv21). I need a faster lead or a way to ensure Mean Look hits.
- **Scripted Locations**:
    1. Burned Tower (Found)
    2. Cianwood City (Found)
    3. Route 42 (Current Target)
    4. Kanto / Tin Tower (Future)
