### Current Task
- **Map 4_5**: Dance Theater Interior.
- **Action**: In the lobby. Moving to the stage to fight the Kimono Girls.
- **Status**: Revive (used), Super Potion (x3) left. Money: ¥10.
- **Correction**: I do NOT have TM28 (Dig). Plan: Rely on Flame Wheel (90 BP with STAB) vs Mud-Slap (40 BP with SE).
- **Next**: Exit Mart -> Kimono Girls (Dance Theater).

- **Kimono Girls Gauntlet**:
  - **Defeated**: Umbreon, Espeon, Vaporeon.
  - **Remaining**: Flareon, Jolteon.
  - **Status**: Garnet (80/96 HP). Super Potion used.
  - **Strategy**: Flame Wheel sweep. Use Smokescreen (Slot 3) if needed.
- **Rocket Grunt**: Interact after clearing the stage.
- **Reflection (Turn 14780)**:
  - **Progress**: Arrived at Dance Theater.
  - **Goal**: Win these battles.
  - **Lesson**: Manual healing was faster than debugging the Joy loop. Adaptability wins.
- **Map 4_5**: Row 4 is a stage ledge. Access via stairs at x=1 and x=10.
- **Reflection (Turn 14832)**:
  - **Status**: Battling Espeon. Used Smokescreen (Slot 3) by accident (meant Flame Wheel).
  - **Plan**: Switch to Flame Wheel (Slot 4).
  - **Hygiene**: Notepad and markers are clean.
  - **Goal**: Clear the theater, get Surf.
