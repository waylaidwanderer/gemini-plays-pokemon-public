# Game Mechanics & Discoveries
## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR (Brown): Walkable, non-sliding.
- ICE (B1F Rows 1-2): Sliding mechanic.
- PIT: Warp to B2F. Filling a pit creates a stopper on B2F.
- BOULDER: Resets on ladder use. Hypothesis: Does NOT reset on pit fall.
- STRENGTH: Must be re-activated after battle or floor change.

## Encounters
- Golbat (Lv25) at (5, 9).
- Delibird at (7, 9).
- Zubat at (12, 11).

# Tracking & Verification
- B2F Stoppers: (5, 12) and (12, 13) present (Unverified since Turn 28375).
- Pits: P3 and P4 filled (Hypothesis). P1 and P2 unfilled.
- Verification Needed: Return to B2F to confirm P3/P4 stoppers before finishing P1/P2.

## Battle Strategy
- Leader Clair: Dragonair Lv37 x3, Kingdra Lv40.
- Team: Typhlosion (45), Graveler (44).

# Failed Hypotheses
- "B1F floor tiles do NOT slide" was too broad; Row 1-2 ice tiles DO slide.
- Mixed inputs in menus cause errors; use single actions or autopress.
