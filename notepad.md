# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Reach the Dragon Shrine via the East Whirlpool.

# Current Status (Turn 18297)
- **Location:** Dragon's Den B1F (24, 22).
- **Facing:** Down (Verified).
- **Action:** Open Party Menu to check cursor position.
- **Reasoning:** Party Menu cursor likely remembered Lapis (Slot 3) or Muscle (Slot 4) from previous turns. Must verify before navigating to avoid selecting wrong Pokemon.
- **Sequence:** `Start`, `A`.

# Plan
1. Check Party Menu cursor.
2. Navigate to Lapis.
3. Use Whirlpool.
4. Navigate South to Dragon Shrine Entrance.

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Requires HM06 Whirlpool + Glacier Badge. Usage: Menu -> Pokemon -> Select Mon -> Whirlpool.
- **Lava/Magma:** (None here, but good to remember).
- **Ice:** (None here).

# Lessons
- **Menu Navigation:** Always verify cursor position before committing to a sequence. Blind input leads to wrong menus (e.g., PACK instead of POKEMON).
