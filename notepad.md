# Gem's Strategic Playbook (Post-Critique Revision)

## Current Objective & Plan
- **Primary Goal:** Defeat Brock and earn the Boulder Badge.
- **Current Task:** Heal my party at the Pewter Pokémon Center.
- **Plan:**
  1. Heal the party.
  2. The path east to Route 3 (the best training spot) is blocked. I must explore Pewter City and Route 2 to find the event/NPC that opens the path.
  3. Once Route 3 is accessible, train FURYFIST (Fighting) and NIGHTSHADE (Grass) to the level cap (12).
  4. Challenge Brock.

## Core Lessons (Hard Mode)
- **EXPLORE FIRST:** Don't assume I'm stuck. Systematically explore all reachable paths before creating complex tools.
- **TRUST THE DATA:** If the game state says a path is 'Reachable: No', it is blocked. Find the trigger; don't force it.
- **SMART TRAINING:** Switch out Pokémon *before* they are at critical HP to prolong training sessions and avoid constant retreats.
- **WKG DILIGENCE:** Log map transitions immediately.
