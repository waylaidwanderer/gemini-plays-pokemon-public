# Key Game Mechanics & Lessons Learned (Turn 7021 Update)
*   **EXP Cap Mechanics:** Pok√©mon at level cap do not gain EXP, even if message appears. Badge earned mid-battle doesn't retroactively apply EXP if capped at battle start.
*   **Pikachu Movement:** 1st press turns, 2nd moves if moving *into* his tile and not facing him.
*   **Level Caps:** 0 badges = Lv12. 1 badge = Lv21.
*   **Poison Damage:** Outside battle, 1 HP every 4 steps.
*   **Notepad `replace` Action:** `old_text` must be an *exact* match. Use `overwrite` for safer, larger changes.
*   **Viridian Pokecenter Exit Trap:** Exiting Viridian Pokecenter (map 41) to Viridian City (map 1) at (24,27) places Pikachu at (24,26) (warp back). MUST sidestep.
*   **Pewter City - Route 3 Access (East):** The eastern exit of Pewter City leads directly to Route 3 (East of Pewter).
*   **Ledge Mechanics:** One-way (downwards only).
*   **Dialogue Loops:** If 'A' or 'B' presses fail to advance dialogue or initiate battle after 2-3 attempts, abandon interaction, mark NPC, and move on. Do not repeat failed interaction attempts.
*   **Map Transition Variance:** Exiting a map from different adjacent edge tiles can lead to different arrival coordinates on the destination map. Must test alternative edge tiles if the initial one leads to an undesired area (e.g., Pewter City East Exit to Route 3).

# Agent Roster & Development Notes (Turn 7021 Update)
*   **Defined Agents (10/10 Max):** `map_analyzer_agent`, `scripted_event_tracker_agent`, `team_builder_agent`, `local_pathfinder_agent` (Tested), `notepad_query_agent` (Tested), `npc_interaction_planner_agent` (Tested), `training_spot_advisor` (Untested), `path_segmenter_agent` (Tested), `emergency_exit_planner_agent` (Tested), `hm_usage_advisor_agent` (Untested - No HMs yet).
*   **Agent Usage Reflection:**
    *   `emergency_exit_planner_agent` was useful for finding an escape from Route 3.
    *   Pathfinding agents (`local_pathfinder_agent`, `map_analyzer_agent`) should be used promptly after 1-2 manual pathing failures, especially in complex areas.
    *   Untested agents (`training_spot_advisor`, `hm_usage_advisor_agent`) should be tested when relevant opportunities arise.
*   **Key Reminders & To-Do:** Verify agent outputs. Test untested agents. Be more proactive with pathfinding agents.

# World Knowledge Graph (WKG) Management Notes
*   Verify map transition *just occurred* before adding edges. Nodes for known exits can be added pre-transition. Use consistent tags.
*   Ensure `destination_entry_point` in edges is accurate.
*   **Critical:** Investigate Pewter City East Exit to Route 3. My WKG node `e8788e15-95e0-437a-83bd-740c855978ec` (Route 3 (2,11) from Pewter (40,19)) conflicts with arrival at Route 3 (1,11). Different Pewter exit tiles might lead to different Route 3 arrival points. Systematically test Pewter (40,18), (40,20), (40,17) if (40,19) continues to lead to the lower path.

# Current Objectives & Plans (Pewter City - Turn 7021)
*   **Primary Goal:** Progress towards the next Gym Badge (Misty in Cerulean City).
*   **Secondary Goal:** Successfully navigate Route 3 towards Mt. Moon by accessing the main upper path.
    *   **Method (Revised after critique & repeated failed Route 3 entries):
        1.  From Pewter City (current: 40,19), attempt to exit to Route 3 via a *different* eastern edge coordinate. Start with (40,18), then (40,20), then (40,17) if needed, until arrival on the main, upper path of Route 3 is confirmed.
        2.  Carefully document the Pewter City exit coordinate and corresponding Route 3 arrival coordinate in WKG once the correct path is found.
        3.  Once on the main path of Route 3, proceed east. Attempt to battle any trainers not previously confirmed as looping. Adhere strictly to the 2-3 failed interaction attempt limit before abandoning and marking problematic NPCs.
        4.  Explore all reachable paths and clear unseen tiles on Route 3, prioritizing eastward progression towards Mt. Moon.
        5.  Enter Mt. Moon from the eastern end of Route 3.
*   **Tertiary Goal:** Train Pok√©mon towards the new level cap of 21.
    *   **Method:** Prioritize using Pok√©mon that are not yet at Lv21 in trainer battles. Engage wild Pok√©mon only if necessary for specific party members and they are not at risk of fainting.
*   **Immediate Action Plan:**
    1.  Move from current position (40,19) in Pewter City to (40,18).
    2.  Attempt to exit to Route 3 from (40,18).
    3.  Verify arrival point on Route 3. If it's the main upper path, proceed. If not, return to Pewter and try next alternative exit tile.

# EXP Tracking Summary (Post-Brock)
*   SPBARKY (Pikachu, Lv12 -> Lv14): Gained EXP after Brock, now 2851 EXP.
*   ODDISH (Oddish, Lv12): 973 EXP (Gained 277 EXP from Onix, but was capped for Geodude EXP). Still Lv12.
*   FLAREE (Vulpix, Lv7 -> Lv10): Gained significant EXP on Route 3, now 1233 EXP.
*   Lesson: EXP gain messages can be misleading if Pok√©mon was capped at the start of battle, even if a badge raises the cap mid-battle. Actual EXP is applied later or not at all for the capped portion.

# Encounter Issues & Stalled Progress (Route 3 - Documented Loops)
*   **Cool Trainer F (ID 4) at (17,10) on Route 3:** Dialogue loop ("Quit staring if you don't want to fight!"). Multiple failed attempts (approx. 5+ across turns 6905-6912). Marked with ‚ùó. **Status: Abandoned.**
*   **Youngster (ID 2) at (11,7) on Route 3:** Dialogue loop ('than those found in the forest!'). 7 failed attempts (turns 6932-6936, 6938, 6940). Marked with ‚ùó. **Status: Abandoned.**
*   **Youngster (ID 3) at (15,5) on Route 3:** Dialogue loop ('when your box is full!'). 6 failed attempts (turns 6946-6948, 6950-6951, 6952). Marked with ‚ùó. **Status: Abandoned.**
*   **Youngster (ID 5) / BUG CATCHER at (20,6) on Route 3:** Battle Won. Post-battle dialogue loop ('If a POK√©MON BOX...') for 10+ turns (6973-6987). Marked as defeated (‚ò†Ô∏è). **Status: Battle Won, dialogue loop problematic.**
