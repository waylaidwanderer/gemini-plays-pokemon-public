## 1. Party Composition & Strategy

## 2. Gameplay Insights & Lessons
- **Systematic Exploration:** Verify location names (`map_id`) after warping *before* documenting or exploring. Avoid assumptions.
- **NPC Interaction:** Non-battling/defeated trainers are impassable walls. Some event NPCs offer gifts.
- **Game Mechanics:**
    - Poison deals 1 HP damage every 4 steps.
    - Level-capped Pokémon show EXP gain, but it's a visual bug (no actual gain).
    - Non-volatile status conditions are cured after trainer battles.
    - PC System: 'SOMEONE's PC' is for Pokémon, 'Gem's PC' is for Items.
    - HM CUT: Used by pressing 'A' on a tree, not from a menu.

## 5. Untested Hypotheses & Plans
- **Underground Path Item:** Girl mentioned people lose things in the tunnel. Could be a hidden item.
- **Poison Fainting:** Confirmed by Sailor that poison can cause fainting outside battle.

- **Agent Failures (Turns 10672-10673):** Pathfinder and Map Explorer agents initially failed by routing through water; prompts were updated. Map Explorer then failed with a schema error, which was also corrected. Agent refinement is key!
