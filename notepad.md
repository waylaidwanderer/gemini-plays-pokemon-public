# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Current Task
- **Mechanic**: Stepping on (7, 15) transitions between Map 3_14 (Upper) and Map 3_13 (Lower/Hole State).
- **Goal**: Find the B1F drop on Map 3_13.

### Notes
- **Map 3_13**: Burned Tower 1F (Entrance/Outer). Contains exit to Ecruteak at (9, 16).
- **Map 3_14**: Burned Tower B1F (Center Room). Accessible via warp/hole from 1F.
- **Problem**: Explored 3_14 and found no Beasts.
- **Hypothesis**: Either I missed them in 3_14, or there is another section of B1F accessible via a different hole/ladder.
- **Action**: Heal, get Rock Smash user (Bolin/Sandshrew), then re-explore 1F to find other holes or breakable rocks.
- **URGENT**: Garnet is POISONED (PSN). Need to find the drop/beasts quickly or retreat to heal.

- **Map 3_13**: Tile (15, 4) is a BREAKABLE ROCK (impassable), despite being TYPE_3fe2. BFS will fail here. Go around via the Left side (Col 4).
- **Map 3_13**: Item at (14, 2) is blocked by Breakable Rock at (15, 4). Requires Rock Smash.
- **Exploration**: Checking bottom-right area (Cols 14-16) before leaving.
