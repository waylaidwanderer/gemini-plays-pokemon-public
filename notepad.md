# Gem's Playbook (Post-Critique)

## Core Strategy & Goals
- **Primary Goal:** Defeat Brock and earn the Boulder Badge.
- **Secondary Goal:** Heal the party at the Pewter City Pokémon Center.
- **Tertiary Goal:** Acquire more Poké Balls at the next opportunity.

## Key Learnings & Tactics
- **Progression Trigger:** Defeating the Gym Leader is the most likely way to open new routes. Test this before exploring other, less likely hypotheses.
- **Efficient Training:** Switch out Pokémon before they are at critical HP to prolong training sessions. After this healing trip, I will continue training on Route 2.
- **Tool Usage:** Use the `pathfinder_agent` for complex navigation. Use the `progression_advisor_agent` when feeling stuck.
- **Situational Awareness:** Do not attempt to use overworld tools like notepad_edit or redefine agents during a battle.
