## Strategy: Inner Channel Zig-Zag to Suicune
**Start Turn:** 48900 (Quest: Trigger Suicune Overworld Sighting)

Cianwood's buoy walls (X=26, X=22, X=19) must be bypassed using specific gaps:
1. X=26 Wall Gap: Row 10-14 (Target: (25, 10))
2. X=22 Wall Gap: Row 16-24 (Target: (21, 16))
3. X=19 Wall Gap: Row 21 (Target: (18, 21))

### Execution Plan
1. Surf to (25, 10) via gap at (26, 10).
2. Surf to (21, 16) via gap at (22, 16).
3. Surf to (18, 21) via gap at (19, 21).
4. Surf North to (18, 12) and land at (16, 12).
5. Walk to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.
