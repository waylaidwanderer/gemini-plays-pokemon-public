# I. Active Quests & Investigation Logs

## Main Quest: The Enigmatic Old Amber
-   **Objective:** Retrieve the Old Amber.
-   **Location:** Pewter Museum of Science.
-   **Obstacle:** A Scientist at (13, 5) on 1F blocks the path to an item.

-   **Confirmed Puzzle Steps:**
    1.  Lead with a Geodude or a revived fossil Pokémon (Omanyte, Aerodactyl) and speak to the Old Man at (2, 5) on 1F.
    2.  Speak to the Scientist at (8, 6) on 2F, who mentions the space exhibit.
    3.  Interact with the Kabutops Fossil at (3, 7) on 1F.

-   **Consolidated Failed Hypotheses:**
    -   Solving the full puzzle sequence with Geodude, Omanyte, or Aerodactyl in the lead does not move the blocking scientist.
    -   Triggering the Aerodactyl fossil trap and then immediately interacting with the Pikachu at (4, 5) does not move the blocking scientist.
    -   Interacting with the Aerodactyl Fossil at (3, 4) and then immediately speaking to the Old Man at (2, 5) changes his dialogue but does not move the blocking scientist.
    -   Interacting with the Aerodactyl & Kabutops Fossils in immediate succession does not move the blocking scientist; both simply trigger traps.
    -   Leading with a Pikachu and interacting with the NPC Pikachu at (1, 6) does not trigger a special event; it is another trap.
    -   Re-checking dialogue with the Old Man at (2, 5) after completing all puzzle steps yields no new dialogue.
    -   After completing the internal museum puzzle sequence, speaking to the Super Nerd at (28, 18) in Pewter City yielded no new dialogue or progress.

-   **Current Testable Hypotheses:**
    1.  Present a revived fossil Pokémon (Omanyte/Kabuto) to the blocking scientist at (13, 5).
    2.  Present *any* revived fossil (including Aerodactyl) to the blocking scientist.
    3.  After completing the puzzle sequence, speak to another NPC *outside* the museum in Pewter City to trigger a change.

## Active Quest: The Copycat's Gift
-   **Objective:** Give the POKé DOLL to COPYCAT.
-   **Location:** Cerulean City (exact location of COPYCAT TBD).
-   **Status:** Item obtained. Ready to proceed once COPYCAT is found.

# III. Key Discoveries & Lessons Learned

-   **IMMEDIATE MAINTENANCE (CRITICAL):** Deferring tool/agent fixes is a critical failure. Maintenance tasks are always the highest priority, above any in-game action.
-   **Confirmation Bias & Over-Correction (CRITICAL):** My handling of the Rocket Hideout B2F maze was a cascade of cognitive errors. **Lesson:** Do not swing from one bias to another. Trust verifiable data and tool outputs over intuition.
-   **Hypothesis Testing Failure (Preparation):** Arrived at a location to test a hypothesis without the required Pokémon/items/moves. **Lesson:** Always verify party composition and necessary items/moves *before* traveling.
-   **Tool Deferral Failure (CRITICAL):** Repeatedly deferred the creation of necessary tools instead of building them immediately. **Lesson Reinforced:** If a repetitive manual task can be automated, or a complex reasoning task can be delegated, building a tool or agent for it is the highest priority.
-   **Game Corner Entry Failure (CRITICAL):** Became stuck in a loop attempting to enter the Celadon Game Corner while Pikachu blocked a warp tile. **Lesson:** If a specific path or objective is repeatedly blocked, do not persist with the same failed approach. Re-evaluate, check for alternate routes, or pivot to a different high-priority goal.

# V. Hypothesis Log & Strategic Pivots

- **Core Assumption:** The solution to moving the blocking scientist on 1F is located on 2F.
- **Contingency Plan:** If all 2F hypotheses are exhausted, the next strategic pivot will be to investigate potential puzzle triggers exclusively on 1F, questioning the core assumption.

### Agent-Generated Hypotheses (Testing Phase)
- **Hypothesis 1 (Untestable):** Speak to the other scientists in a specific order (MUSEUM1F_SCIENTIST2 -> MUSEUM1F_SCIENTIST3 -> MUSEUM1F_SCIENTIST1). (Reason: All three scientists are in unreachable areas.)
- **Hypothesis 2 (Failed):** Interact with both the AerodactylFossil at (3, 4) and the KabutopsFossil at (3, 7) in immediate succession.
- **Hypothesis 3 (Failed):** Interact with the `AerodactylFossil` at (3, 4), and then immediately speak to the `MUSEUM1F_GAMBLER` at (2, 5). This changed his dialogue but did not move the blocking scientist.
- **Hypothesis 4 (Untestable):** Stand directly behind the blocking scientist at (13, 4). (Reason: The area is unreachable.)

### Self-Generated & Post-Assessment Hypotheses
1.  **Hypothesis (External Trigger - FAILED):** After completing the internal museum puzzle sequence, speaking to the Super Nerd at (28, 18) in Pewter City yielded no new dialogue or progress.
2.  **Hypothesis (Fossil Presentation - PENDING):** The blocking scientist at (13, 5) on 1F will move if I speak to him while leading with a revived fossil Pokémon (Omanyte or Aerodactyl).
3.  **Hypothesis (Item Use - FAILED):** Use a drink item on the Pikachu at (12, 8). (Reason: Game mechanics prevent using items on overworld NPCs; it opens the party menu instead.)
4.  **Hypothesis (Itemfinder - FAILED):** Use the Itemfinder in the area between the fossils. (Result: 'ITEMFINDER isn't responding.')
5.  **Hypothesis (Meowth Presentation - PENDING):** Lead with a Meowth and speak to the Gambler at (2, 5).
6.  **Hypothesis (Trap Sequence - FAILED):** Trigger the Kabutops fossil trap, then interact with the Pikachu. (Result: This sequence only triggered a series of traps and did not move the blocking scientist.)

# VI. World Knowledge & Mechanics

## Tile & Object Interaction Rules
- **PC Interaction:** The PC is stateful. Interaction must be from an adjacent tile (typically below), not on top of the PC tile itself.
- **Fossil Trap Tiles (Pewter Museum):** Interacting with the Aerodactyl or Kabutops fossils triggers a trap, moving the player onto an impassable tile and making the NPC Pikachu disappear. This state is escaped by pressing 'B'.
- **Pikachu Trap (Pewter Museum):** Interacting with the NPC Pikachu after triggering a fossil trap results in a similar trap state, also escaped by pressing 'B'.

# X. Pokemon Locations (Observed)

- *This section will track where different Pokemon species have been found.*

# XI. Tool & Agent Improvement Log
- **pokemon_hunter (FIXED):** The previous implementation was naive and did not account for map boundaries, causing movement failures. The tool has been refactored to accept a rectangular boundary (`x_min`, `x_max`, `y_min`, `y_max`) and a starting position to ensure all generated movements stay within the specified hunting area.
- **Route 8 Spawning Trees:** Cuttable trees can spontaneously appear on this route, blocking the path and interrupting movement.
