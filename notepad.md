## Strategic Plan: Defeat Falkner (Violet City)
1. **Recruit Geodude:** Catch in Dark Cave (Route 31) for Rock-type advantage.
2. **Violet City Logistics:** Visit PC and heal.
3. **Training:** Calcifer to Lv10 (Ember), Icarus to Lv9.
4. **Sprout Tower:** Sweep with Ember; obtain HM05 (Flash).
5. **Gym Prep:** Collect Bitter Berry (Route 31).

## Exploration Queue (Route 30)
- East Ledge: (12, 3-15)
- West Grass: (1, 26-35)

## Lessons Learned

- BATTLE MENUS: Separate directional and action inputs.
- EXPLORATION: Use list_unseen_reachable_v2 for new paths.
- STRATEGY: Geodude is the most efficient counter for Falkner.
- TASK: Verify directionality of East/West ledges when encountered.
