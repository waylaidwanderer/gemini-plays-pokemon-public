# Map Structure & Route
- **Goldenrod Underground (3_53):** Divided into isolated sections.
  - **Main Tunnel:** Top & West areas. Contains (3, 2) Ladder and (3, 34) Ladder.
  - **Southeast Room:** Isolated. Contains Ladder (22, 27) and Warp (21, 31).
  - **Connection:** Map 3_54 (Warehouse Entrance) connects the Main Tunnel (via 3, 2) and Southeast Room (via 22, 27).
- **Current Location:** Northwest Room (Map 3_54).
- **Goal:** Reach Southwest Ladder (3, 34) in Main Tunnel.

# Strategy
- **Puzzle Mechanic:** "Open one shutter, another closes." Sequence: 3 -> 2 -> 1.
- **Current Status:** Switch 3 ON, Switch 2 ON, Switch 1 ON.
- **Hypothesis:** Sequence complete. Path to Director/South should be open.
- **Next Step:** Verify changes in map structure (South walls).

# Important Locations
- **Switch 1:** Map 3_54 (OFF).
- **Switch 3:** Expected in NW corner.
- **Locked Door:** At (18, 6) in Main Tunnel. **Verified as One-Way EXIT.**
- **Switch Room Entrance:** Ladder at (3, 34).

# Archive (Completed/Failed)
- **Dept Store Puzzle:** Solved (South Gate opened), but led to Dead End (Blue Barrier).
- **Rival Battle:** Defeated Silver.
- **Blockage:** Path South (Row 10) blocked. Needs switch to open.
- **Observation:** Turning Switch 2 ON caused tiles (10, 7) and (11, 7) to change from WALL to FLOOR. Middle South Path is now OPEN.
- **Plan:** Proceed to Switch 1. Turn it ON to complete the 3 -> 2 -> 1 sequence.
- **Goal:** Verify if this sequence opens the blockade at Row 10 or allows access to the SW Ladder.
- **Observation:** Switch 1 ON (after 3->2) resulted in the East Path (x=16) being BLOCKED at Row 6.
- **Hypothesis:** The "3 -> 2 -> 1" sequence opens the Middle Path (x=10) or clears the Row 10 blockade, instead of the East Path.
- **Action:** Checking the Middle Path (x=10) and then the Row 10 blockade.
- **Success:** The 3 -> 2 -> 1 sequence opened the Westmost Path (Column 2).
- **Observation:** Tiles (2, 6) and (2, 7) changed from WALL to FLOOR.
- **Next Step:** Navigate south through this new opening to bypass the Row 10 blockade.
