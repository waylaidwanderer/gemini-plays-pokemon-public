# Strategic Goals
1. **Wake Snorlax:** Needs Poke Flute & Power.
   - *Status:* In Lavender Radio Tower. Testing Radio Card.
   - *Problem:* Tuned to 20 but text was "TUNING".
   - *Hypothesis:* Need to confirm if I have the EXPN Card functionality.
   - *Test:* Tune Down (~20 presses) to find *any* Kanto station (e.g. 18.5 or 10.5).
   - *If Station Found:* I have the card. Will tune back to 20 carefully.
   - *If No Station:* I don't have the card. Must investigate Director/Quests.
   - *Next:* Verify Card -> Tune to 20 -> Fly Vermilion -> Wake Snorlax.
2. **Collect Badges:** Thunder (Done), Marsh (Done).
