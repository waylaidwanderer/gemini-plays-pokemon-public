## II. Strategic Notes & Mechanics

### A. Hard Mode Rules
- Battle Style: Set.
- No items in battle.
- Level caps: 0 badges=12, 1=21, etc.

### B. Resource Management
- SPROUT's TACKLE (1 PP) is reserved *exclusively* for the Brock battle. Wild encounters must be handled with LEECH SEED or by running.
- Conserve PP on all low-count moves.

### C. Untested Assumptions
- **Assumption 1:** The eastern grass patch on Route 22 is the optimal training spot. (Could be inefficient).
- **Assumption 2:** SPROUT will learn a damaging Grass-type move upon leveling up. (Learnsets are custom; cannot be relied upon).
