# Strategy: Trigger Suicune Sighting (Started: Turn 51131, Turn 51339 - Refined Plan)
- City Logic: Vertical walls and buoy barriers partition the city. No direct water path exists to the northern coast. Row 51, Row 32 (partial), Row 12, and Column 2 are the primary highways.
- The Grand Loop (Execution Plan):
  1. Walk West to (13, 32), then South to (13, 49).
  2. Walk East to (20, 49), then South to (20, 51) (Southern Highway).
  3. Walk West along Row 51 to (2, 51) (Western Corridor).
  4. Walk North along X=2 to (2, 12) (Northern Highway).
  5. Walk East along Row 12 to (14, 12), then North to (14, 10).
- Battle Prep: Lead Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion).

# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard traversable tile.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable collision.
- WATER: Traversable only while using SURF.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way passage (South only). Jump FROM ledge to tile below.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way passage (North only). Walk ONTO from south or walk North from it.
- ROCK (Object): Impassable until cleared with ROCK SMASH.

# Discoveries
- Smashed Rocks: (5, 29), (4, 25).
- Suicune sighting spot: (14, 10).
