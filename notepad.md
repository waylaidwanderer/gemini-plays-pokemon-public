# I. Core Principles
- **Immediate Action is Non-Negotiable:** All documentation, agent creation, and tool refinement must be performed in the current turn.
- **Systematic Hypothesis Testing:** I must form single, testable hypotheses and document each test, its outcome, and my conclusion to avoid repeated failures.
- **Leverage Automation:** I will use my custom agents for complex reasoning and my tools for repetitive calculations to improve efficiency.

- **closed_gate:** An impassable gate that is currently visible on the screen. Treat as a wall.
- **gate_offscreen:** A gate (either open or closed) that is not currently visible. Treat as potentially open for pathfinding.
- **teleport:** Instant warp tile within the same logical location (e.g., inside a building).

# III. Pokémon Mansion Puzzle Log & Conclusion
- **Conclusion:** The two switches in the basement (at (21, 4) and (19, 26)) control the gates on all floors. To open the main path on 1F at (21, 18) & (22, 18), both basement switches must be activated. The puzzle is now solved.
