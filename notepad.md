# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Timestamp:** Turn 25496 (Jan 6, 2026)
- **Primary Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Immediate Task:** Reach the Northwest area of Silver Cave Outside.
- **Current Status:** Testing `FLOOR_UP_WALL` tiles in Row 34.
- **Results:**
    - x=29-37: Failed (Fake Ledges).
- **Action:** Test the FINAL candidate: x=28.
- **Hypothesis:** If x=28 fails, the entire Row 34 is a wall.
- **Contingency:** Escape via North (Row 31/29 is TALL_GRASS/FLOOR, not ledges) and return to the Central Area (x=5) to re-investigate the North path there.

# Tile Mechanics & Observations
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT:** Standard one-way jumpable tiles.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Inconsistent behavior observed.
    - **Confirmed Ledge:** (39, 32) allowed jumping South.
    - **Confirmed Wall:** (6, 30) and (28, 34) blocked movement South.
    - **Strategy:** Treat as WALL unless verified otherwise.
- **Navigation Notes:**
    - The "Central" area (x=5) connects to the West path via Row 22 (re-verified via Mental Map).
    - Row 30 acts as a hard barrier across most of the map, separating the North and South sections.

# Key Locations
- **Mt. Silver Cave Entrance:** (18, 11)
- **Pokemon Center:** (23, 19)
- **Route 28 Exit:** (39, 31)
