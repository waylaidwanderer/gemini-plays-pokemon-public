# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Cure Jasmine's Ampharos (Lighthouse).
- **Secondary Goal:** Investigate Lighthouse.
- **Critical Observation:** On 5F, Bird Keeper Denis is at (8,3). The tile behind him (8,4) is a WALL. Therefore, walking past him is impossible unless the wall is fake.
- **Current Hypothesis:**
    1. Denis's tile (8,3) is a hidden hole/warp. He must move.
    2. OR The entrance to the Center Room is on 4F North (Cols 8-9, Row 2), accessible from the main 4F area.
- **Immediate Plan:** Try talking to Denis from (9,3). If he doesn't move, go to 4F and check the North side (Cols 8-9) for an opening.

## Lighthouse Navigation Log
- **1F-3F:** Cleared.
- **4F:** West Ladder (3,5) leads to 5F. East side is a drop zone from 5F (dead end). Center (Cols 8-9) is walled at South (Row 9).
- **5F:** West Ladder (3,5) leads to 4F. Center Room (Cols 8-9) blocked by Denis at North, Walled at South.
