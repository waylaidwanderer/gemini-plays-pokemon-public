# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Location:** Route 28 (West End).
- **Status:** Exiting to Silver Cave Outside.
- **Action:** Move to (0, 13) via the southern ledges.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Escaped wild battle.
  2. Confirmed that the current area (Route 28 West Main) is a dead-end loop that does NOT lead to the House at (7, 3) because of the ledges at Row 5.
  3. The House is likely accessed via a separate entrance.
  4. Plan: Exit to Silver Cave Outside, then search for a northern/western path I missed.
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Find the path to the House.
  2. Proceed to Silver Cave.

# Reflection (Turn 25341)
- **Status:** Battling Wild Ponyta on Route 28.
- **Hygiene:** Notepad updated. Map markers to be updated post-battle (failed hidden path).
- **Goals:** Catch Ponyta, then explore West Route 28.
- **Strategy:** Using Ultra Balls at full health due to level difference risk.
- **Tools:** `select_battle_option` being used. `find_path` ready for post-battle.
