**Dragon's Den Navigation:**
- 1F (5, 15) connects to B1F (20, 3).
- Current Location: B1F Main Cavern.
- Status: Reached Dragon Shrine Island.
- Insight: The "BUOY" tiles at row 23 are actually WHIRLPOOLS. Direct 'A' interaction failed.
- Requirement: HM06 Whirlpool (Taught to Lapis).
- Plan: Open menu to manually use Whirlpool from Lapis's options.
- Target: Whirlpool at (24, 23).
- Correction: Previous failure was due to facing UP, not the interaction method.
- Plan: Close menu, face DOWN (towards whirlpool), and interact.
