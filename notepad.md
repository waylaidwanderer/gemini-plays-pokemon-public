# Suicune Strategy
- **Status**: Roaming Johto. All scripted milestones (Burned Tower to Tin Tower) cleared.
- **Battle Plan**:
    - Lead: XENON (Gastly, Lv21).
    - Turn 1: MEAN LOOK (Must hit before Suicune flees).
    - Turn 2+: HYPNOSIS (Sleep), then chip damage and ULTRA BALLS.
    - Speed Concern: Suicune (Lv40) is likely faster than XENON (Lv21). Mean Look only works if we move first.
- **Encounter Loop**:
    1. Check Pokedex AREA map.
    2. Transition between maps (e.g., Ecruteak and Route 38).
    3. Suicune relocates every time you cross a boundary.
    4. When Suicune is on your route, use Super Repel and search grass.

# Logistics & Supplies
- **Super Repel Search (Started Turn 18550)**:
    - Ecruteak Mart: Verified NO (Turn 18554).
    - Goldenrod Dept. Store: Verified NO (Turns 18585-18625).
    - Olivine City Mart: Verified YES (Turn 18664).
    - Status: Purchasing 4 Super Repels.
- **Training Plan (XENON)**:
    - Target: Level 35-40.
    - Location: Route 39 (near Moomoo Farm) for consistent EXP.
- **PC Storage (Box 1)**: RICOTTA (RATICATE 16), CINNABAR (GOLDEEN 21), VORTEX (POLIWAG 22), INTERCEPT (YANMA 12), ROCKY (ONIX 6), EGG (CLEFFA 5), XFDW (MEOWTH 16), FRITTATA (TOGEPI 5), SHUCKIE (SHUCKLE 15), Blarney (SUDOWOODO 20).

# General Mechanics
- **Tile Traversability**:
    - Walkable: FLOOR, TALL_GRASS, CAVE, GRASS, SAND, STAIRS, DOCK, WARP, STAIRCASE, ICE, WHIRLPOOL, WATER (with Surf), DIRT, PATH, DOOR, WARP_CARPET_DOWN, WARP_CARPET_LEFT, WARP_CARPET_RIGHT.
    - Blocked: WALL, COUNTER, MART_SHELF.
    - One-way: LEDGE (hop down).
- **Interactions**:
    - Clerks/Nurses: Face the counter tile in front of them and press A.
    - Phone calls: Wait for "Click!" or "……" before resuming movement.
- **Menus**: Gen 2 menus remember the last selected item.
- **Travel**:
    - Cannot use FLY from inside buildings; must be outdoors.
    - FLYING forces roaming Pokemon to a completely random location in Johto.
    - Poké Mart inventories scale with Badge progress.

# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- COUNTER: Impassable; interact with NPCs from adjacent tile.
- MART_SHELF: Impassable.
- WARP_CARPET_DOWN: Traversable; triggers map transition.
- TALL_GRASS: Traversable; wild encounters.
- GRASS: Traversable.
- WATER: Traversable with SURF.
- CAVE: Traversable.
- SAND/DIRT/PATH: Traversable.
- STAIRS/STAIRCASE: Traversable; map transition.
- LEDGE: One-way (down).
- ICE: Slippery movement.
- WHIRLPOOL: Requires WHIRLPOOL HM.

# Primary Goal Strategy: Catch Suicune
1. Acquisition: Obtain Super Repels (Priority: Olivine Mart, then Mahogany/Blackthorn).
2. Tracking: Consult Pokedex AREA map to identify Suicune's current route.
3. Manipulation: If Suicune is distant, use FLY to a central city (like Ecruteak) to randomize its location until it is nearby.
4. Interception: Move back and forth across a map boundary (e.g., Ecruteak City <-> Route 37) until the Pokedex shows Suicune on the current route.
5. Engagement: Lead with XENON (Lv21), apply Super Repel, and walk in grass.
6. Capture: Execute MEAN LOOK immediately. Use HYPNOSIS and NIGHT SHADE to weaken, then throw ULTRA BALLS.
