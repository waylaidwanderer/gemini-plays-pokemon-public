# Pokémon Crystal Journey

## Current Situation
- **Objective:** Begin the Pokémon Gym Challenge. The first gym is in Violet City.
- **Next Step:** Travel through Route 29 to Cherrygrove City, then onwards to Violet City.
- **Status:** On Route 29, continuing my journey.

## Party
- Hestia (Cyndaquil)
- Vermin (Rattata)
- Hedwig (Hoothoot)

## Long-term Goal
- Become the Pokémon League Champion.

## The Rival
- A red-haired boy named KAINE stole a Totodile from Professor Elm's lab.

## Key Items
- **POKéGEAR:** Received from Mom. Has a Phone feature. Mom is saving money for me.
- **POKéDEX:** Received from Professor Oak.
- **POKé BALLS:** Received from Elm's assistant. Used one to catch a Rattata.

## Mechanics & Discoveries
### System Mechanics
- **Stuck on Warp/Event Tile:** If movement is locked after a warp or event, opening the main menu ('Start') and then closing it ('EXIT' or 'B') can resolve the issue.

### Environmental Mechanics
- **Route 29 Ledges:** The western section of Route 29 has one-way ledges preventing eastward travel from that area.
- **Route 46:** This route is a dead-end when approached from the south due to one-way ledges.
- **CUT_TREE:** These small trees are impassable and require the HM 'Cut' to be removed.

### Battle Mechanics
- **Held Items (Berries):** Pokémon can use held Berries to heal themselves in battle.
- **Catching:** Weakening a Pokémon makes it easier to catch.
