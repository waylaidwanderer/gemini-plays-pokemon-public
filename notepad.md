# Suicune Quest (Crystal)
- Started: Turn 17252 (Dec 24, 2025).
- Milestone: Cianwood sighting completed (Turn 16423).
- Current Status: Attempting to trigger Route 42 sighting.
- Trigger Hypotheses:
  - Entering island center clearing (y=15 to y=12).
  - Walking north from (28, 15) around trees.
  - Pokedex 'Area' confirms Route 42.

# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL / HEADBUTT_TREE / FRUIT_TREE / COUNTER: Impassable.
- TALL_GRASS / LONG_GRASS: Traversable, triggers wild encounters.
- WATER: Impassable without Surf.
- LEDGE_HOP / LEDGE: One-way movement (usually South).
- WARP / DOOR / WARP_CARPET: Map transition.
- CUT_TREE: Impassable until Cut is used.

# PC Storage (Box 1)
- VORTEX (Poliwag 22), INTERCEPT (Yanma 12), ROCKY (Onix 6), EGG (Cleffa 5), XFDW (Meowth 16), FRITTATA (Togepi 5), SHUCKIE (Shuckle 15), Blarney (Sudowoodo 20).

# Key Observations
- Suicune Sighting Sequence: Burned Tower -> Cianwood -> Route 42 -> Route 36 -> Tin Tower.
- Route 37 "WEIRD_TREE" objects at (6, 12) and (7, 12) are the Twins Ann & Anne, not Suicune.
- Sage Permission Logic: Permission in 4_1 flags Route 42 completion.
- Navigation: Building 4_1 is a mandatory passage to Tin Tower backyard.
- History of Ecruteak: Two towers were roosts for flying Pokemon. One burned down. Three Pokemon (water, lightning, fire) ran off into the grassland.
- Burned Tower items: Cooltrainer mentioned hidden items in the Burned Tower.

# Items Received
- Fire Stone: Collected from Alan on Route 36 at (31, 14).
- Itemfinder: From Cooltrainer in Ecruteak Itemfinder House (Turn 17417).

# Lessons Learned
## Menu Navigation
- Use 1-2 button presses at a time and verify screen state in complex menus (FLY map, Pokedex).
- Verify "Currently selected" text before committing to navigation tools.

## Suicune Trigger Mechanics
- Pokedex 'Area' tracks the current active overworld sighting location.
- Sightings are triggered by specific tile-entry or movement zones, not object interaction.
