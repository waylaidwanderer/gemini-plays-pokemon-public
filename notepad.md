# Current Strategy: Defeat Red
- **Start Turn:** 26770 (Jan 7, 2026)
- **Location:** Silver Cave Room 3 (3_76)
- **Status:** In Battle with Red.
- **Action:** Switching to **Kunai (Sneasel)** (Slot 4) to counter Espeon.
- **Matchup:** Kunai (Dark/Ice) vs Espeon (Psychic).
- **Goal:** Defeat Red.
- **Battle Plan:**
  - **Kunai:** Immune to Psychic. Use Shadow Ball (Ghost vs Psychic is SE) or just serve as a pivot to revive Muscle if needed.
  - **Muscle:** Currently has -2 Attack. Needs to be switched out to reset stats. This switch accomplishes that.
  - **Next Steps:** If Kunai can damage Espeon, great. If not, heal Muscle while Kunai tanks.
- **Items:** 15 Full Restores, 19 Revives.

# Key Findings
- **Silver Cave:** Room 2 Warp (11, 5) led directly to Room 3 (Red's Chamber), not Item Rooms.
