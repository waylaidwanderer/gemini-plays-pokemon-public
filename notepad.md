## Strategy: Inner Channel Route to Suicune
**Start Turn:** 48900 (Quest: Trigger Suicune Overworld Sighting)

Cianwood is a maze of 'FLOOR_UP_WALL' barriers. I will navigate the buoy gaps to enter the 'Inner Channel' (X=18) and land on the northern plateau.

### Step-by-Step Execution Plan
1. Surf to (25, 10) via the gap in the X=26 buoy wall at Row 10. <- CURRENT TASK
2. Surf South to (25, 16), then West to (21, 16) via the gap in the X=22 buoy wall at Row 16.
3. Surf South to (21, 21), then West to (18, 21) via the gap in the X=19 buoy wall at Row 21.
4. Surf North in the Inner Channel to (18, 10).
5. Land on the plateau at (16, 10) or (17, 10) and walk to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

## Navigation: Buoy Gaps (X-Wall at Row)
- X=26 Wall: Gap at Row 10-14.
- X=22 Wall: Gap at Row 16-24.
- X=19 Wall: Gap at Row 21.

## Failed Hypotheses & Lessons
- Great Sea Bypass (Route 40): Dead end on the West.
- Southern Crossing (Row 48/51): Blocked by multiple 'FLOOR_UP_WALL' lines at Rows 46 and 50.
- Inner Channel North (X=13-17): Blocked at Row 15 by a solid wall of WALL tiles.

## Inventory Check
- Super Repel: 5 remaining. Last applied turn 49278. (~195 steps remaining).

## Battle Strategy: Eusine
- Lead: Calcifer (Lv 64 Typhlosion).
- Strategy: Sweep with Flamethrower. OHKO potential on most targets.
