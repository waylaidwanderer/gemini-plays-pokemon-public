# Suicune Event Analysis
- **Critical Failure:** Battled Suicune at Tin Tower 1F and WHITED OUT.
- **Current State:**
    - Suicune is GONE from Tin Tower 1F.
    - Warp to Roof (10,2) is INACTIVE.
    - Wise Trio Sages are GONE from their room (Barrier Station).
    - "The TIN TOWER shook!" flag is ACTIVE.
- **Hypothesis:** 
    1. Suicune might have reset to a roaming state.
    2. Suicune might have returned to a previous location (Cianwood, Route 42).
    3. The event might be "failed" until Elite Four (worst case).
    4. The Wise Trio moved to a location I missed (e.g., outside on the trail, or hidden in the tower).

# Log (Condensed)
- **Burned Tower:** Checked 1F & B1F. Empty. No Eusine.
- **Barrier Station:** Wise Trio Room empty. Ladder logic verified.
- **Tin Tower:** 1F Sages generic. Warp inactive.
- **Turn 16157:** Started Suicune search on Route 42.
- **Route 42 Grove:** Suicune is NOT here.
- **Suicune Status:** NOT registered as 'Seen' in Pokedex (Search for Water type yielded only Poliwag & Gyarados). Cannot track via Area.
- **Hypothesis:** Whiting out against Suicune might have prevented the 'Seen' flag from setting, or the event logic is unique.
- **Current Plan:** Proceed to Blackthorn City. The Suicune questline may continue later or require a different trigger.
