## II. Mechanics & Learnings
### Tile Traversal Rules (Verified)
- **Objects are impassable:** All map objects (NPCs, items, signs) act as walls.
- **Defeated Trainers:** Passability is inconsistent and must be tested individually.
    - Hiker Daniel at (4, 6) in Union Cave is PASSABLE.
    - POKéMANIAC LARRY at (4, 21) in Union Cave is IMPASSABLE.
    - Firebreather Bill at (14, 16) in Union Cave is PASSABLE.
    - Hiker Anthony at (6, 13) on Route 33 is PASSABLE.
- **WALL:** Impassable.
- **FLOOR:** Traversable.
- **TALL_GRASS / LONG_GRASS:** Traversable, triggers wild encounters.
- **COUNTER:** Impassable.
- **DOOR/CAVE/LADDER:** Warp tile.
- **MART_SHELF/BOOKSHELF/TV/RADIO/PC/TOWN_MAP/WINDOW/PAINTING/STATUE/PILLAR:** Impassable scenery.
- **WARP_CARPET_DOWN/RIGHT:** Warp tile. Activated by pressing Down/Right respectively, not by stepping on and on.
- **WARP_CARPET_LEFT:** Warp tile. Activated by pressing Left.
- **VOID:** Impassable.
- **CUT_TREE:** Impassable without CUT.
- **WATER:** Impassable without SURF.
- **HEADBUTT_TREE:** Impassable.
- **unseen**: Impassable.

### One-Way Traversal (Verified)
- **LEDGE / FLOOR_ALLOW_HOP_DOWN:** One-way downward traversal.
- **FLOOR_ALLOW_HOP_LEFT:** One-way traversal to the left.
- **FLOOR_ALLOW_HOP_RIGHT:** One-way traversal to the right.
- **FLOOR_ALLOW_HOP_DOWN_OR_RIGHT:** One-way traversal down or right.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Complex one-way tile. Verified in Union Cave. Can be moved onto from below (by pressing Up). Cannot be moved off of by going Up or Down. Sideways movement (left/right) on and off the tile is permitted.

### Core Mechanic Learnings
- **Fainting is never the correct strategy.** It is impossible to be truly stuck. If a path seems blocked, there is always another way forward.
- HMs must be used from the PACK menu, not the Pokémon's party menu.
- **HM moves cannot be forgotten once taught.**

## III. Tool Development & Self-Critique
- **New Methodology:**
    1.  **Observe:** If a tool fails or behavior is unexpected, my first step is ALWAYS to verify the specific game mechanic through direct, in-game observation.
    2.  **Document:** I will IMMEDIATELY update the 'Tile Traversal Rules' in this notepad with my verified findings. This notepad is my source of truth.
    3.  **Implement:** Only after the mechanic is fully documented will I modify a tool's code to reflect this verified knowledge.
    4.  **Test:** I will then perform a single, definitive test of the tool. If it fails, I will restart the process from step 1, rather than guessing at code changes.
- **Agent Trust:** I MUST trust my agents' outputs, even if they seem counter-intuitive. My `quest_strategist` correctly identified the path forward when my own visual assessment failed. Disregarding an agent's advice is a critical error.
- **Knowledge Management:** I must remember to check my World Knowledge Graph for existing nodes/edges before attempting to add new ones to avoid redundant operations. I must be more careful with `destination_entry_point` when creating edges.
- **path_finder:** Cannot see or account for off-screen objects. Paths generated may be physically impossible if a known, but off-screen, obstacle is in the way. I must manually verify paths against my map markers.

## IV. Current Plans & Hypotheses

### Goal: Investigate Ilex Forest

### Key Clue
- **Youngster in Azalea Town:** Mentioned the 'Charcoal Man's' Pokémon can CUT down the trees in ILEX FOREST. This confirms Kurt is the Charcoal Man and I need to find a way to get the HM Cut or a Pokémon that knows it from him to proceed west into the forest.

### Active Hypothesis
- **The solution to my current roadblock is in Ilex Forest.** I have been stuck in Azalea Town trying to solve the Slowpoke Well puzzle. My `quest_strategist` agent suggested that the real trigger for progression is located in Ilex Forest, which aligns with the clues I have gathered.

### Failed Attempts Log (DO NOT REPEAT - Azalea Town)
- **Talking to Kurt (before Mart clue):** Failed 5+ times. His dialogue was in a loop.
- **Talking to Grunt at Well (before Kurt event):** Failed 4+ times. He will not move via conversation alone.
- **Talking to Grunt at Well (after Kurt left his house):** Failed. Dialogue changed, but he still blocks the path.
- **Talking to Grunt at Gym:** Failed. Unrelated dialogue.
- **Talking to Youngster in Kurt's House:** Failed. Unrelated dialogue.
- **Talking to Kurt (after well grunt interaction):** Failed. Dialogue unchanged.
- **Interacting with Farfetch'd statue:** Failed. No plot progression.
- **Re-attempting Kurt event sequence:** Failed. The event did not trigger as expected.

### Untested Assumptions
- **The officer in the Ilex Forest gatehouse is the key to entering the forest.** I will test this by talking to him. If that fails, I will talk to the Granny and then attempt to exit west.
