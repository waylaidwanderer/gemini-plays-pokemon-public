# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Location:** Route 28 (Middle Section).
- **Status:** Battling Wild Ponyta (Turn 25345).
- **Action:** Press A to confirm USE of Ultra Ball (Attempt 2).
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. The "USE/QUIT" menu is still open with "USE" selected.
  2. Previous 'A' press apparently didn't trigger the throw (menu persisted).
  3. Pressing 'A' again to force the action.
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Catch Ponyta for Pokedex.
  2. Reach the hidden house at (7, 3) via the West side.
