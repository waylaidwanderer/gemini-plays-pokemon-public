# Current Strategy: Return to Red
- **Timestamp:** Turn 26399 (Jan 7, 2026) [Silver Cave Item Rooms]
- **Status:** At (10, 3) in Item Rooms (3_77). Center section confirmed as dead end loop from Warp (13, 3).
- **Observation:** Ledges at y=4 are impassable walls.
- **Action:** Returning to Room 2 via Warp (13, 3).
- **Hypothesis:** I missed a path in Room 2 (Middle Section) after the waterfall.
- **Plan:**
  1. Warp back to Room 2 (13, 21).
  2. Explore the water/land in Room 2 Middle thoroughly.
  3. Look for hidden caves or surfable paths to the North.

# Tile Mechanics
- **WARP_CARPET_DOWN:** Must step DOWN onto this tile to trigger warp.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** South-facing Ledge at y=4.
  - **Status:** Surfing at (13, 30) in Room 2.
- **Action:** Navigating to Waterfall base at (11, 30).
- **Plan:**
  1. Move to (11, 30).
  2. Ascend Waterfall at (11, 29).
  3. Explore the area above (Room 2 Upper / Room 3).
- **Hypothesis:** The waterfall is the exit from the Item Rooms loop and leads to Red.
- **Observation:** The Waterfall tiles at y=29 are passable but push the player back (DOWN) if entered without the HM active.
- **Correction:** Must interact (Face Up + Press A) to use HM. Moving into the tile causes a pushback loop.
- **Strategy:** Attempting rapid input (Up+A) to interact before movement/pushback occurs.
- **Correction:** 'Can't use that here' when selecting from menu.
- **Action:** Must interact with the waterfall directly by pressing A while facing it from the overworld.
- **Observation:** Entering the waterfall tile pushes the player back and forces them to face DOWN.
- **Strategy:** Reset facing by moving away and coming back.
- **Plan:** Move DOWN to (11, 31), then move UP to (11, 30) (ensuring Face UP), then press A to trigger HM.
- **Encounter:** Wild Ursaring at (11, 23) in Silver Cave Room 2.
- **Strategy:** Run (Low on balls, saving Master Ball).
