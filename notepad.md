# Mechanics & State
- **Fly Mechanics:** Blocked on door mats (29,4) AND adjacent (29,5). Safe spot: (29,6).
- **Menu Navigation:** Start Menu WRAPS. Resetting blindly is risky. Visual confirmation required.
- **Party Navigation:** Mistral is in Slot 6.
- **Map Navigation:** Cherrygrove -> (Up) Violet -> (Left) Ecruteak.

# Strategy
1. Exit Menu & Move to (29, 6) [Executing].
2. Open Menu & Select Mistral -> Fly.
3. Navigate Map: Up -> Left -> A.

# Reflection
- **Error Analysis:** Fly failed at (29,5). Likely blocked. Previous note about (29,5) being blocked was correct.
- **Action:** moving to (29,6) to eliminate position as a failure variable.
