# Gem's Pokémon Crystal Notepad

## I. Core Directives & Lessons Learned

*   **Data Integrity is Paramount:** My internal state (notepad, markers) MUST be 100% accurate. I will not defer data correction. Assumptions must be rigorously tested before being recorded as fact.
*   **Trust Automation:** My custom tools are more reliable than my manual analysis. I must prioritize using them to avoid unforced errors.
*   **Act Immediately:** I am an LLM. There is no 'later'. Tool/agent refinement and data management tasks must be performed in the current turn, overriding gameplay actions.
*   **Scientific Method:** For all puzzles, I will strictly follow: Observe -> Hypothesize -> Test -> Conclude. I will document every step and attempt to falsify my own conclusions to avoid confirmation bias.

## III. Current Investigation: Team Rocket Hideout

*   **Objective:** Find the Team Rocket Boss and disable the radio signal.
*   **Current Location:** Team Rocket Hideout, Floor B3F.
*   **Key Discoveries:** The hideout entrance is in the Mahogany Mart. The ladder at (27, 2) on B1F is a one-way exit to the Mahogany Mart. Picking up an item with a full bag causes a dialogue loop. Defeated NPC sprites can block paths.

### Passwords
*   **Password 1:** SLOWPOKETAIL (from Rocket Girl on B3F)
*   **Password 2:** Unknown

## IV. Battle Discoveries & Type Chart

### Verified Type Interactions
*   **Water (Surf) vs. Gyarados (Water/Flying):** Observed as "not very effective". This contradicts standard type charts. Need to investigate further.

## V. Open Investigations

### Untested Assumptions
*   **Hypothesis:** The second password for the Team Rocket hideout is located on B3F.
*   **Alternative Hypothesis:** The password is held by an NPC I've already encountered, or is in a previously explored area.
*   **Test:** If B3F yields no password, I will systematically re-explore the entire hideout, talking to every NPC again.
