## Training Strategy: Route 31
- **Method:** "Lead and Switch". Lead with trainee (Gneiss), switch to Calcifer (Quilava) on turn 1 to share EXP.
- **Start Turn:** 1740 (Timestamp: 2025-12-18).
- **Check-in Interval:** Every 50 turns (Next check: Turn 1800).
- **EXP Tracking (Targeting Rock Throw):**
  - Gneiss (Geodude, Medium Slow): Lv10 (596 EXP). Goal: Lv11 (742 EXP). Remaining: 146 EXP.
  - Rocky (Onix, Medium Fast): Lv5 (125 EXP). Goal: Lv14 (Rock Throw) - On hold for efficiency.

## Primary Goal Strategy: Defeat Falkner (Violet City)
- **Opponent Data:** Pidgey (Lv7), Pidgeotto (Lv9).
- **Key Move:** Mud-Slap (Lowers Accuracy).
- **Tactics:**
  - Lead with GNEISS (Geodude).
  - Use Rock Throw (Lv11) for super-effective STAB damage.
  - If accuracy drops too low from Mud-Slap, switch to Calcifer or Icarus to reset stats.
  - Calcifer (Quilava) is a strong backup due to level advantage.
- **Current Status:** Training Gneiss to Lv11.
