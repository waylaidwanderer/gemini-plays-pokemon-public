# Roamer Hunt Strategy
- **Goal:** Catch Raikou & Entei.
- **Current Plan:** Fly to Ecruteak City (Central Hub).
- **Status:** In New Bark Town (arrived via Fly). Clearing phone call.
- **Next:** Fly to Ecruteak -> Check Map.
- **Resources:** 16 Repels.
- **Session Start:** Turn 36369. Current: 36756.

# Reflection (Turn 36756)
- **Error Analysis:** Route 35 Gatehouse Shuffle failed to move Roamers for 15+ cycles.
- **Lesson:** Gatehouse transitions likely do not count as map transitions for Roamers. Use Route boundaries or Fly.
- **Tooling:** "cycle_roamer_hunt" tool failed due to positioning drift and warp mechanics. Manual 2-turn shuffle was safer but tedious.
- **Correction:** Abandoned Route 35. Relocating to Ecruteak.

# Tile Mechanics
- **Warp Tiles:** Must step *off* and then *back on* to trigger. Standing on them does nothing.
- **Ledge Hop:** One-way jump.
- **Headbutt Tree:** Can be shaken for Pokemon.
