# Quest Log
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Status:** Searching for West Entrance.
- **Next:** Traverse West Corridor to Red.

# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Location:** Silver Cave Outside.
- **Status:** Searching for West Entrance.
- **Action:** Navigate East to (15, 29), Surf to (24, 29), then South via (28, 30) gap.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Southbound movement at (5, 29) is blocked by "FLOOR_UP_WALL" tiles which act as walls from the North.
  2. Westward movement is blocked by the wall at Column 3.
  3. The only exit is to backtrack East.
  4. Mental Map shows a gap in the South barrier at (28, 30) (Tall Grass). 
  5. To reach it, I must Surf East from (15, 29), land at (24, 29), then walk East to the gap.
  6. From the gap, I can reach the bottom corridor (Row 35) and traverse West to the target area.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Exited cave at (18, 11) (Main Entrance). 
  2. The internal West Corridor (Column 0) was inaccessible from the main area due to ledges. It likely connects to a hidden external entrance.
  3. Row 24 contains water. I will Surf West to search for land and a second cave entrance.
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.

# Tile Mechanics
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN:** One-way South.

- **WARP_CARPET:** Step on to exit map.
- **CUT_TREE:** Obstacle unless Cut is used.
- **PIT:** Drops player to floor below.
- **LADDER:** Transitions between floors.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Walkable from South/Sides. Northbound exit is BLOCKED (Verified at 8,14). Acts as a one-way ledge preventing Northward movement.
- **BUOY:** Water boundary/Wall.
