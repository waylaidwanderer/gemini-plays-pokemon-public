# Legendary Roamer Hunt (Current Focus)
- **Primary Strategy**: The Ecruteak Shuffle. Transition between Route 37 and Ecruteak City to force roamer movement, then pace in grass.
- **Lead Pokemon**: ICARUS (Lv 19 Pidgeotto). Perfect for the Repel Trick on Route 37 (wild levels 13-16, roamers level 40).
- **Repel Status**: Super Repel active (Applied Turn 44664, ~180 steps remaining).
- **Roamer Sightings**: None yet.
- **Catching Strategy**:
  - Raikou: Use Master Ball immediately.
  - Entei: Use XENON (Haunter) for Hypnosis. Note: Roamers flee on turn 1. High speed or priority moves/trapping is required if not using Master Ball.

- **Repel Trick**: Use a lead with level between local wild and target legendary.
