# Suicune Quest (Crystal) - FIXED SIGHTINGS
- Milestone 1: Burned Tower (Seen).
- Milestone 2: Cianwood City (Seen). Defeated Eusine.
- Milestone 3: Route 42 (In Progress). Pokedex shows Suicune here.
- Milestone 4: Route 36 (Next).
- Milestone 5: Tin Tower (Final). Requirement: Clear Bell (OBTAINED) + all sightings.

## Strategy for Route 42 Sighting:
- Location: Middle island (X=24-30, Y=14-17).
- Approach: Surf to island landing at (24, 14). Center requires HM01 CUT.
- Northern Corridor: Reachable via surfing North from (32, 8) and landing at (30, 6).

# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Elevation boundaries. One-way walls from the North; impassable from the South.
- WATER_ROCKS: Impassable.
- CUT_TREE: Impassable until HM01 CUT.
- WATER: Traversable with HM03 SURF.
- TALL_GRASS / LONG_GRASS: Traversable; triggers encounters.
- LEDGE: One-way traversable (usually South).
- WARP / DOOR / WARP_CARPET / CAVE: Map transition.
- FRUIT_TREE: Impassable; interact for fruit/apricorn.

# Task Timestamps & Log
- Suicune Hunt (Route 42): Started Turn 17642.
- Investigation: Island center sweep 100% complete (Turn 17968). Suicune sprite NOT present at Apricorn trees (28, 16).
- Hypothesis: Suicune might be in the northern corridor (Row 3-4) or requires a map refresh (enter/exit cave).
- Northern Corridor: Path at (30, 6) leads North to Row 4. Corridor extends from X=30 to X=59. Accessible via surfing north from eastern water.
