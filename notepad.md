# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026
- Current Location: Goldenrod City (East Alley)

### Immediate Goals
1. **Find Sudowoodo**: Located on Route 36.
2. **Find Floria**: She is missing from the Flower Shop, likely on Route 36 near Sudowoodo.
3. **Get SquirtBottle**: Reward for finding Floria/Clearing Sudowoodo.

### Navigation Logic
- **Route 35 Layout**: Divided into East (Grass/Trainers) and West (Path to Gatehouse) by a fence/tree line.
- **The Crossing**: The only connection between East and West is likely South, near the water/Daycare (approx Y=28).
- **Gatehouse Location**: The Route 36 Gatehouse is at the Northwest corner (approx 3, 5).
- **National Park Gate**: Located at (25, 2) - North East. (Currently accessible but leads to park, not Sudowoodo?).

### Current Plan
1. Defeat Psychic Mark in the Underground (10_3).
2. Exit South/West back to Goldenrod City (10_2).
3. Locate the Flower Shop in Goldenrod City (10_2) to get the SquirtBottle.
4. Head North through Route 35 to Route 36.
5. Use SquirtBottle on Sudowoodo.

### Key Locations
- **Goldenrod City**: South of Route 35.
- **National Park**: North of Route 35 (via Gatehouse).
- **Route 36**: North of Route 35 (via Gatehouse? Or direct path?).
- **Sudowoodo**: Blocking the path on Route 36.

### Quest Log
- **Badges**: Zephyr, Hive, Plain.
- **Party**: Garnet (29), Basil (6), Pearl (5), Amethyst (8), Amber (5), Spider (14).
- **Mail Quest**: Met Mail NPC at (15, 4). No item received yet.
- Note: The alleyway at x=17 contains ledges. It is a one-way path South.
- Encountered trainers and wild Pokemon (Yanma) in the alleyway/grassy area south of x=17. This might be a hidden area of Goldenrod or a map transition anomaly.
- ALERT: Trapped in East Alley (Cols 13-19). North blocked by ledges (Row 18), West by trees/fence (Col 12), South by trees (Row 32). Need to verify if there is ANY exit using code.
