# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Location:** Route 28 (West End).
- **Status:** Battling Wild Rapidash (Turn 25363).
- **Action:** Press A to confirm USE of Ultra Ball.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Screen explicitly shows Item Menu with Ultra Ball -> USE selected.
  2. Ultra Ball count dropped from 12 to 11, indicating one was used previously.
  3. Despite history confusion, current state demands pressing A to throw.
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Catch Rapidash.
  2. After battle, delete erroneous map marker at (31, 3).
  3. Explore West end for hidden paths.

# Reflection (Turn 25341)
- **Status:** Battling Wild Ponyta on Route 28.
- **Hygiene:** Notepad updated. Map markers to be updated post-battle (failed hidden path).
- **Goals:** Catch Ponyta, then explore West Route 28.
- **Strategy:** Using Ultra Balls at full health due to level difference risk.
- **Tools:** `select_battle_option` being used. `find_path` ready for post-battle.
