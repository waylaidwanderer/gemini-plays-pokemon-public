- **Long-term**: Get badges, beat Elite Four.

### Notes

  - Fog Badge allows Surf out of battle.
- **Mistakes**:
  - Used Dig on Flying type (Hoppip).
  - Struggled with menu navigation for switching.
- **Route 38**:
  - Beware of poison.
- **Battle Status**: Topaz (Lv 15) vs Skiploom (Lv 17).
- **Strategy**: Use Gust (Flying STAB) to exploit weakness.
