# Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR:** Standard traversable tile.
- **WALL:** Impassable obstacle.
- **WATER:** Traversable only with Surf.
- **TALL_GRASS:** Traversable, chance of wild encounters.
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN:** One-way movement South. Impassable from other directions.
- **LEDGE_HOP_RIGHT:** One-way movement East. Impassable from other directions.
- **LEDGE_HOP_LEFT:** One-way movement West. Impassable from other directions.
- **CUT_TREE:** Obstacle. Removable with Cut HM.
- **LADDER:** Warps to another map or floor.
- **DOOR:** Warps to another map or interior.
- **Correction:** The "Cape" tip at (50-55, 4) is walled off from the land. The only access is via the water channel at x=56.
- **Correction:** Access to the x=56 water channel is blocked on Route 25 by walls. Must access from Route 24 (Nugget Bridge) East side.
- **Plan:** Return to Route 24 -> Surf East of Bridge -> Head North to (56, 4).
- **Route 25:** Water at (42-45, 8-11) might connect to the Cape channel (x=56).
- **Plan A:** Go to (42, 12), Surf North to (42, 11), check East passage. If open, proceed to Cape.
- **Plan B:** If East passage blocked, return to Maze (West side), go to (4, 17), Surf South to Route 24 West, then Surf East under bridge.
- **Correction:** The water pool at (42-53, 8-11) is ISOLATED. The 'LADDER' tiles allow access to the East side of the pool, but there is no exit to the main channel (x=56).
- **Plan:** Surf West back to (42, 12) -> Walk West to (11, 13) -> South to Route 24 -> Surf North from Route 24 East side.
- **Route 25 South Trap:** The area south of the maze (Rows 13-17, x=11-39) is a dead end reachable only via the isolated pool at (42, 12).
- **Geography:** East-West crossing is possible at Row 8. Vertical barrier (Ladders) exists only at x=8-9, y=12-17.
- **Current Plan:** Walk West to (4, 15) (avoiding Youngster at 12,8), Surf South to Route 24 West, then Surf East under bridge to Cape.
- **Goal:** Reach Cape (Route 25) via Route 24 East water channel.
