### Strategic Reflection (Turn 8719)
- **Status**: Stuck in Goldenrod for ~100 turns.
- **Issue**: Oscillating between East/West without clearing the "fog of war".
- **Insight**: The North-East (Flower Shop) is a cul-de-sac. The Central North Wall seems solid. The only remaining option is the North-West quadrant, which is largely "unseen".
- **Action Plan**: 
    1. Return to Main Street (y=10).
    2. Move West to x=6.
    3.Systematically explore North from there, hugging the West edge.

### Navigation Notes
- **Location**: Goldenrod City (Radio Tower).
- **Goal**: Reach Far West Side (North of Tracks).
- **Status**: At Radio Tower (5, 16). No track crossing found here.
- **Plan**: 
    1. Backtrack East to Crossing at (18, 14).
    2. Cross North to (18, 12).
    3. Traverse West along Row 12/13 to the Far West edge (x=0).
    4. Attempt to head North from x=0 or x=1.
- **Hypothesis**: The path North to Route 35 is along the extreme Western edge of the map, bypassing the Ledges at Row 10.

### Quest Chain: SquirtBottle
1. **Defeat Whitney**: Done (Plain Badge obtained).
2. **Find Floria**: Currently seeking at Route 36.
3. **Get Bottle**: Return to Flower Shop after meeting Floria.

### Key Locations
- **Radio Tower**: (5, 16).
- **East Crossing**: (18, 14).
- **Target Area**: (0, 10).
