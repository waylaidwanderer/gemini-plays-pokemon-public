## I. Game Mechanics & Battle Intel

### A. Tile Mechanics & Traversal Rules
- **Ground/Impassable:** `ground` tiles are walkable, `impassable` tiles are solid walls. All objects (NPCs, items, signs) function as impassable walls.
- **Grass:** Walkable tiles where wild Pokémon can be encountered.
- **Water:** Surfable tiles. To initiate SURF, I must be on a `ground` or `steps` tile adjacent to water and use the move from the party menu.
- **Gates (`closed_gate`/`open_gate`/`gate_offscreen`):** `closed_gate` tiles are impassable. `open_gate` tiles are open and act as `ground`. `gate_offscreen` represents a gate whose state is unknown. The state of these can be toggled by switches or other triggers.
- **Ledges:** One-way only. Can be jumped down (from Y-1 to Y+2 in one move), but are impassable from below (Y+1) and from the sides (X-1, X+1).
- **Spinner Tiles:** Force movement in a specific direction. Destinations must be mapped manually.
- **Hole Tiles:** Warp tiles that lead to a lower map area. Often function as one-way drops.
- **Scripted Event Tiles:** Some tiles trigger events. The tile in front of the Cinnabar Gym door (19, 5) pushes the player back and displays a 'locked' message. The water on Seafoam Islands B4F has a scripted current that prevents surfing south.
- **Hidden Passages:** Some maps contain hidden passages that allow traversal through what appear to be solid walls.
- **Cuttable:** A tree that can be cut with HM Cut. Becomes `ground` after cutting.
- **Steps:** Allows vertical movement between `ground` and `elevated_ground` tiles.
- **Elevated Ground:** Walkable ground at a different elevation, accessible only via `steps`.

### B. Confirmed ROM Hack Changes
#### B1. Type Matchups & Immunities
- **Super Effective:** Psychic > Ghost/Poison; Ghost > Psychic; Electric > Rock/Water; CUT (Normal) > VICTREEBEL (Grass/Poison); Flying > Grass/Poison; Psychic > Flying; Ice > Ground
- **Not Very Effective:** Normal !> Psychic; Electric !> Grass; Rock !> Ground; Psychic !> Psychic; Bite (Normal) !> HAUNTER (Ghost/Poison); Ice !> Gyarados (Water/Flying); Poison !> Poison; Ice !> Water
- **Immunities:** Flying-type immune to Ground-type moves; MUK immune to Poison-type moves; HYPNO immune to STUN SPORE (powder moves); MUK immune to THUNDER WAVE (Electric-type status move).
- **Misc:** Ground is RESISTANT (0.5x) to Fire, NOT immune.

#### B2. Battle & Field Mechanics
- **Evasion:** PSYWAVE and CONFUSE RAY can fail against targets with high evasion boosts.
- **'No Will to Fight':** A fainted or sleeping Pokémon cannot be switched into battle.
- **Safari Zone:** Has a time limit. When it expires, the player is warped back to the Safari Zone Gate.
- **Gym Battle Loss:** Losing a battle inside a gym does NOT warp you to a Pokémon Center.
- **Warp Reuse:** To reuse an instant warp you just came through, you must step off the warp tile and then back on to trigger it.

## II. Current Hypotheses & Puzzles

- **Primary Hypothesis (from Agent):** The eastern (boulder puzzle) and western sections of Seafoam Islands are two separate, unconnected dungeons. To access the boulder puzzles, I must exit and re-enter from the Route 19 side (near Fuchsia City), as my current entry from Route 20 is the 'exit' path.
- **Secondary Hypothesis (from Agent):** The Secret Key might not be in Seafoam Islands at all, but in its original location (Pokémon Mansion). If the new entrance doesn't lead to the key, this will be my next investigation.

## III. Lessons Learned & Process Improvement
- **Immediate Maintenance is Paramount:** My repeated failure to fix my `find_path` tool immediately was a critical process violation. The tool failed to account for elevation changes, attempting to path directly between `ground` and `elevated_ground`. This has now been corrected. Tool/agent/notepad maintenance MUST be performed as the highest priority upon identifying an issue. Deferring these tasks is unacceptable.
- **Challenge Assumptions:** My assumption that the eastern and western sections of the Seafoam Islands were connected was wrong. I need to be more open to the possibility of isolated, separate dungeon areas.
- **Automation Opportunity:** Manually planning boulder pushes is inefficient. The `boulder_push_planner` tool should automate this. A future `puzzle_strategist_agent` could provide high-level plans for entire floors.
- **Tool Reliability:** The `boulder_push_planner` correctly identified an unreachable puzzle, proving its logic is sound. This reinforces the need to trust my tools once they are properly built and tested.
- **Map Marker Discipline:** I must stop creating redundant markers for objects already tracked in the game state (NPCs, signs, etc.). This clutters my map memory and is inefficient.

## IV. Archive: Solved Puzzles & Disproven Hypotheses
- **Secret Key (Power Plant - DISPROVEN):** Explored the Power Plant and battled the trainer Craig. No key was found.
- **Secret Key (Cinnabar Island - DISPROVEN):** Thoroughly explored Cinnabar Lab and Pokémon Mansion. No key was found.
- **Secret Key (Mr. Fuji - DISPROVEN):** Spoke to Mr. Fuji in Lavender Town. He provided only his standard post-rescue dialogue.
- **Seafoam Islands B4F Path (DISPROVEN):** The western and eastern sections of Seafoam Islands B4F are completely isolated from each other. There is no path between them on this floor.
- **Seafoam Islands B4F Trap (DISPROVEN):** The eastern section of B4F is NOT a one-way trap. The game state has confirmed a path to the southern warps exists, despite the water current.
- **Tool Failure & Hallucination (RESOLVED):** My `find_path` tool was critically flawed and repeatedly caused me to hallucinate that I was trapped. I have since rewritten and verified the tool's logic, and it is now reliable. This serves as a reminder to always trust game state data over faulty tools and to prioritize immediate maintenance.
- **Seafoam Islands Entrance (DISPROVEN):** Thoroughly explored Route 19 and found no alternate entrance to the Seafoam Islands. This hypothesis is incorrect.

## V. Future Development Ideas
- **Objective Planner Agent:** An agent that analyzes my current progress (badges, level cap, key items) and suggests the next logical major objective, helping to guide my long-term strategy when the path isn't clear.

*Self-Correction during Turn 61348 Reflection:*
- **Lesson: Immediate Action is Non-Negotiable.** I failed to fix my `battle_strategist_agent` and a misplaced map marker immediately, which is a critical process violation. Deferring maintenance tasks is unacceptable and must be corrected. All tool, agent, and documentation tasks MUST be performed the moment they are identified.
- **Lesson: Challenge Map Layout Assumptions.** My belief that the Seafoam Islands was a single, connected dungeon was a form of confirmation bias. I must be more willing to consider that large dungeons may be split into separate, non-contiguous areas, and I should actively try to disprove my own assumptions about map layouts.
