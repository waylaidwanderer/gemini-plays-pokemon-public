# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) in Cianwood City to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The Row 5 Edge Transition
- Plan:
  1. Use Super Repel. [DONE]
  2. Navigate to (0, 5) on Route 41. [IN PROGRESS]
  3. Transition to Cianwood City (29, 5).
  4. Navigate to Suicune's sighting spot at (14, 10) in Cianwood.
- Status: At (20, 6) on Route 41 surfing.
- Reasoning: Row 5 on Route 41 is a clear water highway that bypasses all buoy mazes and leads directly to the Cianwood City transition at the western edge.

# Blocked Routes (Verified)
- Central City: Vertical wall at X=9 (Rows 34-37). Cliff at Row 30.
- Plateau Access: Row 29 is a clear East-West path from X=19 to X=2, bypassing the Row 30 cliff and city walls.
- Southern Corridor: Row 47/48 provides a path from the east side (X=19) to the west beach (X=2), bypassing the central maze.
- Row 50 Cliff: Impassable wall from X=12 to X=19.

# General Lessons
- City Layouts: In Johto cities like Cianwood, horizontal paths (Rows) often bypass vertical blockades (Walls) even if they look like a maze. Always check the full length of a Row for gaps.
