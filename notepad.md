# Route 3 Navigation Plan
- **Current Position:** Route 3 (Lower Path).
- **Insight:** Route 3 has two distinct paths separated by walls from Pewter City:
    1. **Upper Path** (Enter from Pewter at y=14): Leads to Mt. Moon Entrance (Row 1).
    2. **Lower Path** (Enter from Pewter at y=18): Leads to blocked areas/dead ends.
- **Correction:** I am currently on the Lower Path. I must return to Pewter City and switch to the Upper Path.
- **Plan:**
  1. Return to Pewter City (Walk Left).
  2. Explored North (Rows 1-11): Blocked by walls/ledges. Found Berry Trees.
  3. Conclusion: The exit at Row 16 is the northernmost exit.
  4. Plan: Exit at (39, 16). This leads to Route 3 (0, 6).
  5. New Analysis: The exit at Pewter Row 16 puts me in the "Middle Lane" (y=6-8) of Route 3.
  6. Map Data shows the ledge barrier at Row 5 ends around x=22.
  7. Hypothesis: I can switch to the Upper Path by walking East past x=22 and then moving North.
  8. Plan: Walk East to x=25, then check for a path North to Mt. Moon.
  3. Re-enter Route 3 from the Upper Lane (y=14).
  4. Traverse Route 3 along the top edge to Mt. Moon.
- **Next Action:** Walk Left to Pewter City.
