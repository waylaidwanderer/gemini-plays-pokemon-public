## Current Strategy & Obstacles
- **Location:** Goldenrod Underground (Switch Room Entrances - South).
- **Goal:** Find the Locked Warehouse Door (BasementDoorScript at 18, 6 on Map 3_53).
- **Issue:** Walked the full length of the West tunnel (x=3) on Map 3_53 without seeing the door. The door is likely at x=18, separated by a wall.
- **Hypothesis:** Need to find a path to the East side of the Underground. This might be accessible from this map (3_54) or a missed side path on 3_53.
- **Plan:** Explore Map 3_54 to see if I can cross to the East side. If blocked, return to 3_53 and search for side paths.
