# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Location:** Route 28 (East Side).
- **Status:** Approaching Gatehouse.
- **Action:** Move to (33, 6) near the building entrance.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Successfully bypassed the ledge.
  2. Heading to the Victory Road Gate area to establish a landmark.
  3. Will then scout for a path Westward along the northern tree line to reach the unreachable House.
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. The House at (7, 3) likely holds a useful item (TM/Gift) or information.
  2. Need to find the path to it, possibly via a Cut tree.
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.

# Tile Mechanics
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN:** One-way South.
- **LEDGE_HOP_LEFT:** One-way Left.
- **WARP_CARPET:** Step on to exit map.
- **CUT_TREE:** Obstacle unless Cut is used.
- **PIT:** Drops player to floor below.
- **LADDER:** Transitions between floors.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Walkable from South/Sides. Northbound exit is BLOCKED (Verified at 8,14). Acts as a one-way ledge preventing Northward movement.
- **BUOY:** Water boundary/Wall.
