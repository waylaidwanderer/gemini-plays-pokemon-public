# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Deliver Kenya to Route 31.
- **Secondary Goal:** Travel to Mahogany Town (Route 42).
- **Tertiary Goal:** Train Party to Level 30+.

## Quest: Deliver Kenya (Route 31)
- **Status:** Restarting Mail Process.
- **Mail Content Plan:** "DARK CAVE" (Exact sign text).
- **Current State:** Entering Pack.
- **Next Steps:**
    1. Locate Flower Mail (Items Pocket).
    2. Select 'GIVE' -> Kenya.
    3. Type "DARK CAVE" (Verified text).
    4. Deliver to Fisher.

## Knowledge Base
- **Fisher (Route 31):** Rejected "DARK CAVE leads to another road." (All Caps).
- **Wade (Route 31):** Called (Turn 9576). Waiting on Route 31.
- **Dark Cave:** Connects Route 31, 45, 46. Needs Flash.

## Mechanics Log
- **Mail:** Prevents deposit. PC Full -> Mail goes to Bag. Must hold nothing to attach.
- **Inputs:** Pressing Start in Mail menu triggers Printer Error. Use B.
- **Lesson:** Pressing 'Start' in the Mail menu causes a "Printer Error" loop or crash behavior. Use 'B' to exit or 'END' to finish.
- **Correction:** Turn 9724 - Accidental menu navigation occurred in Turn 9723 due to premature closure of Mail interface. Message is likely "DARK CAV".
- **Action:** Taking Mail from Kenya to fix the typo.
- **Correction:** Turn 9726 - 'MAIL detached' text persisted despite B inputs. Pressing A to clear. State ambiguity (Map vs Menu) requires cautious re-verification.
