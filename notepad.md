# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement. Passable from SOUTH to NORTH. Found at (4, 20), (16, 10), (8, 34).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at (10, 15).
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- Start Turn: 49771
- Start Time: 3:29 PM

## Strategy: The Sea Route Bypass (Final)
The northern plateau (Row 10-14) is protected by a maze of land walls, but accessible via the northern sea.
1. Return to (12, 28) and Surf.
2. Surf East to X=23, then North through the (23, 15) buoy gap.
3. Surf East to X=27, then North through the (27, 9) buoy gap.
4. Surf West along Row 8 to (19, 8).
5. Surf South to (19, 10), then West to (16, 10) to land on the plateau.
6. Walk West to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

## Hypotheses
- H1: (18, 10) and (17, 10) are passable (WATER or FLOOR), allowing access to (16, 10) from the East.
- H2: (14, 10) is the trigger point for the Suicune sighting. (Marked in Mental Map).
- H3: (16, 10) (FLOOR_UP_WALL) can be landed on from the East.

# Progress Notes
- Reached (4, 26) on Turn 49789. Land route blocked by ROCK at (4, 25) and WALL at (4, 23).
- Note: SUPER REPEL is active.
- Note: No wild encounters on land in city.
- Failed Strategy: Land Route (Various) - City is a complex maze of walls and ledges. Sea route is more direct.
