# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Challenge the Pokémon League.
- **Secondary:** Traverse Victory Road.
- **Tertiary:** Train team for Victory Road.
- **Immediate:** Navigate Route 26 North.

# Current Status (Turn 18955)
- **Location:** Victory Road 2F East (17, 37).
- **Party:** Gyarados (76/111), Muscle (Lv61).
- **Goal:** Reach Ladder at (17, 33).

# Exploration Log
- **1F:** West and East corridors largely explored. East side of 1F (north end) was a dead end.
- **2F West:** Loop with HP Up.
- **2F East:** Large room. Ladder at (17, 33) spotted but blocked by ledges from South.
- **Key Discovery:** Vertical corridor at x=12 appears open from y=36 Northwards.
- **Hypothesis:** The path to the ladder at (17, 33) involves navigating North along x=12, then looping East across the top (unseen area around y=30) to drop down to the ladder.

# Plan
1.  **Navigate:** From current position (17, 37), go West to (12, 37) area.
2.  **Gap:** Enter x=12 corridor at (12, 36).
3.  **Explore:** Head North along x=12 to (12, 31) and see if it connects East.
- **Status:** Reached 3F North-East corner (18, 11).
- **Plan:** Traverse West along the Northern corridor (Row 11) to (11, 11).
- **Goal:** Find the path South-West to reach the ladder at (17, 19).
