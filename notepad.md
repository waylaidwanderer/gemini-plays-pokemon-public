# Red Battle Strategy
- Grind team to Lv 70+.
- Replace ICARUS (Lv19) with a high-level Water or Electric type (e.g., Suicune).
- Evolve KIMCHI (Gloom) using Sun Stone or Leaf Stone.
- Lead with GNEISS (Graveler) vs Pikachu (uses Earthquake).
- Teach GORP (Snorlax) Shadow Ball (TM02) vs Espeon.
- Use XENON (Haunter) for Curse vs Snorlax.

# Navigation Hypothesis: Left Corridor Access
- Observation: Row 11 is blocked by walls/ledges from accessing X=0 central.
- Hypothesis: Access to the far-left corridor (X=0) and far-right (X=19) is only possible by walking along the bottom (Row 34 or 35).
- Test: Use find_path_v7_robust to reach (1, 35) or (18, 35).
- Conclusion: (In progress).

# Area Records: Silver Cave Room 2 (3_75)
- Warp to Room 1: (17, 31).
- Water: (13, 30), (13, 31).
