### Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Traversable. Standard walking surface.
- WALL: Impassable. Includes walls, fences, and some decorative objects.
- LADDER: Traversable. Triggers a floor change (e.g., 1F to B1F).
- WARP_CARPET_DOWN: Traversable. Triggers a map transition (e.g., building entrance).
- COUNTER: Impassable. Face and press A to interact with NPCs behind them.
- WATER: Impassable. Requires the move SURF and a compatible Pokémon to traverse.
- LEDGE: Semi-traversable. Can be jumped over from above, but acts as a wall from below, left, or right.
- GRASS: Traversable. Zone for wild Pokémon encounters.
- WHIRLPOOL: Impassable. Requires the move WHIRLPOOL to clear.
- WATERFALL: Impassable. Requires the move WATERFALL to climb up or descend down.
- ICE: Traversable. Causes the player to slide in the direction of movement until hitting an obstacle.
- HOLE: Traversable. Triggers a fall to the floor below.

## S.S. Aqua Discoveries
- Fisher at (1, 15) in FastShipCabins_SW_SSW_NW is a trainer (Firebreather Lyle).
- Porthole tiles and pink sprites (e.g., 6, 15 on 15_5) are decorative walls/background tiles, not interactable.
- Sailor at (24, 17) on 1F: "The passengers are all trainers... itching to battle in their cabins."
- My cabin is at (15, 8) on map 15_3.
- Gentleman (2, 17) on 15_6: "She's an energetic child, so she may be bugging someone."
- Lower Deck Sailor (ID 2) at (31, 6) asked me to find his "lazy" buddy.
- Found "lazy" buddy (ID 1) at (30, 6). He said "The CAPTAIN will be furious...".

## Active Quests
- **Find the Gentleman's missing granddaughter.**
  - Started Turn: 37715. Timestamp: Friday, January 9, 2026 at 5:17 PM PST.
  - Status: Investigating lower deck (B1F).
  - Strategy: Get the "lazy" sailor at (30, 6) on B1F to return to his post to clear the path to the western corridors.
  - Hypothesis: The granddaughter is with the missing sailor or near the Captain.
- **Collect the 8 Kanto badges.**
  - Strategy: Vermilion City Gym (Lt. Surge) first. Recommended level 44-50.
  - MVP: GNEISS (Graveler) for Ground immunity to Electric.

## Lessons Learned
- Gengar (Ghost): Immune to Normal moves (Return).
- Dragonite/Charizard: XENON (Haunter) is immune to Normal moves.
- Safeguard: Prevents status/confusion from Outrage.
- Status: Paralysis reduces speed by 75%.
- Lesson: Always verify current map ID and position after movement. Warps can be subtle.
- Lesson: NPCs like the sailors on S.S. Aqua may block corridors until a specific event or dialogue is triggered.

### Map 15_7 (FastShip B1F)
- Eastern Corridor: Contains the ladder to 1F (31, 13) and two sailors (ID 1 and 2).
- Western Corridors: Separated by a wall at x=29. Gaps at y=4 and y=5.
- Target: Super Nerd at (26, 9) and the Captain's Cabin.
- Observation: Talking to the lazy sailor at (30, 6) seems to have triggered him to realize he's in trouble. Expecting him to move.
