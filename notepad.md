# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard walkable ground.
- WATER: Traversable only while Surfing (requires HM03).
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- WALL: Impassable obstacle.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way barrier (Ledge). Blocks movement Up (North) and allows jumping Down (South).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump South. Entering from the side (Left/Right) is blocked.
- Interaction: To Surf, face WATER from an adjacent FLOOR tile and press A. Stepping onto FLOOR from WATER automatically ends Surfing.

# Suicune Quest
- Start Turn: 46650
- Objective: Trigger sighting in Cianwood City at (7, 4).
- Strategy:
    1. Walk south along X=6 to Y=33.
    2. Jump the ledge at (6, 34) to reach the west coast corridor.
    3. Walk west to (2, 34) and then north along X=2 to Y=4.
    4. Walk east to (7, 4) to trigger the sighting.
- Note: The middle path is blocked by a wall at (11, 13). X=6 is a clear north-south path on this strip.

# Roaming Beast Data

# Pokemon Movesets
- XENON (Haunter): Hypnosis, Confuse Ray, Night Shade, Dream Eater.
- Calcifer (Typhlosion): Flamethrower, Return, Smokescreen, Thunderpunch.
- KIMCHI (Gloom): Flash, Petal Dance, Cut, Sleep Powder.

- ICARUS (Pidgeotto): Fly, Sand-Attack, Gust, Quick Attack.

# Lessons Learned
- Verify "gaps" in walls and buoy lines using tools like run_code or pathfinders before committing to long detours. My assumption of a solid wall led to a 100+ turn detour that was unnecessary.
- BUOY tiles at X=16 and X=18 create a channel at X=17, but it is blocked at Y=25. X=15 is clear for North/South travel between Y=16 and Y=31.
