# Strategy: The Suicune Pursuit
- **Time Check:** Attempting sighting since Turn #50620.
- **Objective:** Trigger Suicune sighting at (14, 10) in northern Cianwood.
- **Eusine Battle Prep:** Lead with Lv64 Calcifer. Sweep with Flamethrower/Thunderpunch.
- **Current Plan (The Northern Bay Bypass):**
  1. Currently at Route 41 (0, 45). Surf North to (0, 6).
  2. Move Left to transition back to Cianwood at (29, 6).
  3. Surf West to (17, 6) then South to (17, 10).
  4. Land West at (16, 10) and walk to (14, 10) for the sighting.
- **Verification:** Route 41 western edge (X=0-3) and Cianwood Northern Bay (Row 6) confirmed clear of buoys.
