# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- **Quest Start:** Turn 48900
- **Status:** Executing Terrestrial Path via wall gaps at (9, 33) and (5, 35).

## Execution Plan (Terrestrial)
1. Surf from (13, 16) south to land at (14, 28). <- CURRENT TASK
2. Walk to (9, 33) and pass West through the gap.
3. Walk to (5, 35) and pass West through the gap.
4. Walk North through western corridor (X=2) to Row 14.
5. Walk East to (8, 14), then North to (8, 10).
6. Walk East to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

## Strategy: Terrestrial Path
The city walls at X=9 and X=5 are not solid. Gaps exist at (9, 33) and (5, 35) that allow access to the western corridor (X=2). This corridor provides a direct, ledge-free path to the northern plateau.

## Failed Hypotheses & Lessons
- Island Hop (13, 16) via (11, 15): Dead end alcove at (11, 14).
- Inner Channel (X=12): Blocked at Row 15 by buoy wall.
- Southern Bypass (Surf): Unnecessary; terrestrial gaps identified.

## Progress Summary
- All 16 Badges obtained.
- Elite Four/Red defeated.
- Current Focus: Suicune tracking.
