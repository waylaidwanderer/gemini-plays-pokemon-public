### Current Objectives & Strategy
- **Main Quest**: Begin the Gym Challenge (Violet City).
- **Immediate Goal**: Reach Cherrygrove City.
- **Healing**: Mom (Bank Only) confirmed. No healing at home. Must reach Cherrygrove.

- **Status**: Party HP Critical. Avoid battles.

### Route 29 Navigation
- **Top Lane (Row 6)**: Previously identified as blocked by bushes (x=46). **CRITIQUE: Re-verify. These might be fake walls.**
- **Middle Lane (Rows 10-12)**: Blocked Westbound by Cut Tree (21, 11).
- **Lower Lane (Rows 14-17)**: Previous "Dead End" at x=13 was only verified on Row 15.
- **Escape Route**: Gap at x=31 leads from Lower to Middle Lane. Gap at x=49 leads from Middle to Top Lane.
- **Gatehouse (Route 46)**: Located North at (51, 7). CONFIRMED INACCESSIBLE.

- **Current Plan**: 
  1. Return to Route 29 Top Lane.
  2. **Forcefully test the 'Bushes' at x=46.** Walk directly into them.
  3. If that fails, go to Lower Lane Row 17.

### Tile Mechanics
- **TYPE_c453**: One-Way Ledge.
- **TYPE_2889**: Tree Wall.
- **TYPE_5519**: Cut Tree (Requires HM01).

### Key Locations
- **Cherrygrove City**: Pokemon Center, Mart.
- **Route 30**: Path to Violet City.
- **Correction**: `TYPE_2889` is confirmed to be an OBSTACLE (Trees/Walls), not walkable grass. Previous agent pathfinding failed because of this.
