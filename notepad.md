# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Deliver Kenya to Route 31.
- **Secondary Goal:** Travel to Mahogany Town (Route 42).
- **Tertiary Goal:** Train Party to Level 30+.

## Quest: Deliver Kenya (Route 31)
- **Status:** Correction - Removing Old Mail.
- **Reason:** Kenya is still holding the "DARK CAVE" mail (failed delivery). Must remove it before writing new mail.
- **Plan:**
    1. Exit Pack (B, B).
    2. Enter Party Menu (Up, A).
    3. Select Kenya -> MAIL -> TAKE.
    4. Return to Pack -> Give Flower Mail.
    5. Type: "Dark Cave leads to another road" (Mixed Case).
    6. Deliver.

## Knowledge Base
- **Fisher (Route 31):** Rejected "DARK CAVE leads to another road." (All Caps) and "DARK CAVE".
- **Wade (Route 31):** Called (Turn 9576). Waiting on Route 31.
- **Dark Cave:** Connects Route 31, 45, 46. Needs Flash.

## Mechanics Log
- **Mail:** Prevents deposit. PC Full -> Mail goes to Bag. Must hold nothing to attach.
- **Inputs:** Pressing Start in Mail menu triggers Printer Error. Use B.
- **Lesson:** Pressing 'Start' in the Mail menu causes a "Printer Error" loop or crash behavior. Use 'B' to exit or 'END' to finish.
