# Suicune Capture Strategy (The "How")
- Goal: Capture Suicune (Lv 40, Water).
- Status: Suicune (Lv 40) HP in RED (~5-10%), Accuracy -6.
- Strategy: Tank with GNEISS (Water weakness offset by Suicune's -6 accuracy) and throw Great Balls.
- Hypothesis: Current capture rate with Great Balls at low HP and no status is low (~1.95%) but feasible. Persistence is the primary method as status-capable Pokemon (KIMCHI) are fainted and no Revives are in inventory.
- Failed Attempts: ~126 turns of throwing balls at low HP.
- Capture Analyst: Odds are ~1.95% per Great Ball. Sleep would triple odds, but unavailable.
