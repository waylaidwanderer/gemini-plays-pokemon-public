# Mt. Moon Exploration

## 1. Pokémon Strategy
*   **Zubat (Poison/Flying):** Weak to Electric, Ice, Psychic, Rock. SPARKY is the best counter with Thundershock.
*   **Geodude (Rock/Ground):** 4x weak to Grass/Water. 2x weak to Fighting/Bug. Immune to Electric. SPROUT (Leech Seed) and THISTLE (Double Kick) are the best counters.

## 2. Current Plan
*   Systematically explore Mt. Moon, floor by floor.
*   Prioritize exploring all paths on the current floor before taking a ladder to the next.
*   Find the exit to Route 4 (east side).

*   **Unreachable Item:** The Poké Ball at (3, 21) is blocked by an invisible barrier. Failed to approach from (4, 21) and (3, 22) multiple times. Abandoning for now.
