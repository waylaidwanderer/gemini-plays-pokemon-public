### Current Objectives
1. **Find Floria**: Located at Route 36 (North of Route 35).
2. **Get SquirtBottle**: Return to Flower Shop (19, 1) after finding Floria.
3. **Clear Sudowoodo**: Use SquirtBottle on Route 36.

### Navigation Status: Goldenrod City (Puzzle)
- **Goal**: Reach Route 35 (North).
- **Problem**: Main path blocked at (16, 4). East Path blocked at (32, 6) by fence.
- **Verified Dead Ends**:
    - **Sister's House Area (29, 5)**: Blocked.
    - **Alcove (31, 6)**: Blocked by fence.
    - **East House (33, 9)**: NPCs discussing PP. Likely no passage.
    - **Route 34 East Loop**: Blocked by fence at Row 3.
- **Path Confirmed**: The East Alley (col 19) allows bypass of the blockade. Successfully reached Flower Shop (19, 1).
- **Immediate Plan**: Exit Flower Shop, go North to Route 35, then Route 36. Find Floria near the Sudowoodo. Return to Flower Shop to get SquirtBottle.

### Verified Locations
- **Goldenrod City**:
    - Pokemon Center: (15, 27)
    - Dept Store: (24, 27)
    - Game Corner: (14, 21)
    - Bike Shop: (29, 29)
    - Underground Entrances: (11, 29) [South], (9, 5) [North]

- **Badges**: Zephyr, Hive, Plain.
- **Party**: Quilava (27), Sentret (2), Bellsprout (6), Togepi (5), Rattata (8), Igglybuff (5).
### Reflection (Turn 9251)
- **Progress**: Confirmed West tracks are a dead end.
- **Plan**: Enter Underground via South Entrance (11, 29).
- **Surface Navigation**: successfully exited Underground at (5, 25).
- **Strategy**: The area immediately North of the exit is blocked by planters.
    - Path found: Go South to Row 27, then West to the edge (x=1 or x=2), then North.
    - This aligns with the "Narrow Path" hypothesis.
- **Goal**: Navigate North along the West edge (x=2) to reach the Radio Tower/Route 35 area.
- **Blockage**: (2, 25) seems impassable despite looking like floor. Attempting to bypass via column 3.
