# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026
- Current Location: Goldenrod Flower Shop (Map 10_14)

### Immediate Goals
1. **Find Floria**: Explore the North-East corner of the National Park.
2. **Find Exit to Route 36**: Likely in the North-East.
3. **Get SquirtBottle**: Return to Flower Shop after finding Floria.

### Quest Log
- **Badges**: Zephyr, Hive, Plain.
- **Party**: All Healthy.
- **Mail Quest**: Active.
- **Contest**: Not entered (lack of Sport Balls/Bug Catching logic).

### Strategic Notes
- **SquirtBottle**: Need to talk to Floria to progress.
- **Current Location**: National Park (East Section). Access gained via Cut tree on Route 35.
- **Goal**: Find Floria. Route blocked by Sudowoodo.
- **Hypothesis**: Bypass Sudowoodo by going through the National Park (Main Area) to the East Exit.
- **Plan**: Go to the Gatehouse at (18, 9), enter National Park, find East Exit to Route 36.

### Reflection (Turn 11820)
- **Progress**: Returned to Route 35, navigated to the building at the south end.
- **Correction**: The "Flower Shop Back Door" at (9, 33) needs verification. If it's not a door, I might need to go around to the main gatehouse entrance.
- **Hygiene**: Cleaned up markers. Navigation tool requires precise targets.
- **Plan**: Enter building -> Goldenrod -> Flower Shop -> SquirtBottle.
### Reflection (Turn 11872)
- **Status**: Still looking for Floria. Flower Shop lady requires talking to her.
- **Hypothesis**: Floria is on Route 36. The path to Route 36 from Goldenrod is likely via the "Right Side" of Route 35 (past the Cut tree), bypassing the Park.
- **Action**: Navigate to the Right side of Route 35, head North past the Cut tree at (17, 6).
- **Goal**: Reach Route 36 and find Floria.
