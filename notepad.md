# Current Status
- **Status:** On Route 25.
- **Location:** (40, 4).
- **Goal:** Return to Cerulean City to access Route 9 (Power Plant).
- **Action:** Move North to Route 24 (Cross Map Edge).

# Quest Logic (Cascade Badge)
1. **Fact:** I have TM07 => Power Plant fixed.
2. **Fact:** Misty is NOT in the Gym (checked 23612).
3. **Conclusion:** I missed the "Interrupt Date" event at the Cape.
4. **Plan:**
    - Cross to Route 24 (Move Up from 21, 0).
    - Cross Nugget Bridge to Route 25.
    - Find Misty at the Cape.
    - Return to Gym for battle.

# Navigation Notes
- **Discovery:** Path to Route 24 is via LADDER tiles at x=20/21. The FLOOR tiles at x=23+ are blocked by one-way ledges (Return Path).
- **Route:** (6, 22) -> (6, 16) -> (21, 16) -> (21, 0) -> Route 24.

## Tile Mechanics
- **WATER:** Requires SURF to traverse.
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN:** One-way movement (Down). Impassable from other directions.
- **WALL:** Impassable.
- **LADDER:** Walkable (Bridge/Stairs). In Cerulean North, leads to Route 24.

## Task Timestamp
- **Finding Misty:** Started ~Turn 23600. Current Turn: 23631.
