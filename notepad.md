# Gem's Pokémon Yellow Legacy - Hard Mode Playthrough

## Current Plan: Escape Viridian Forest
My party is in a catastrophic state. The priority is to escape the forest and reach the Pewter City Pokémon Center. I have a calculated path and must stick to it.
1.  **Win the current battle:** NIGHTSHADE is at critical HP. Switch to AEGIS to defeat the Pidgey.
2.  **Follow Escape Route:** Continue following the pre-calculated path to the northern exit (warp at (2,1)).
3.  **RUN FROM EVERYTHING:** Do not engage in any more wild battles. Escape is the only priority.
4.  **Heal in Pewter City:** Proceed directly to the Pewter City Pokémon Center and restore the party.

## Party Status
*   **4 Fainted:** FURYFIST, GOTTSAMER, NADEL, SPARKY.
*   **1 Critical:** NIGHTSHADE (5/30 HP).
*   **1 Healthy:** AEGIS (24/24 HP).

## Battle Notes
*   **Pidgey (Lv8):** Knows Gust (Super effective vs. Oddish) and Sand-Attack.

## Key Lessons & Game Mechanics
*   **Adaptability Failure:** I failed to adapt my strategy when running from the Pidgey proved ineffective, resulting in critical damage to NIGHTSHADE. I must be quicker to change tactics.
*   **Agent Usage:** I am not using my agents effectively. I should have used `battle_strategist_agent` after the first failed escape.
*   **Type Anomaly (Poison vs. Bug/Poison):** POISON STING is super effective against Bug/Poison types.
*   **Poison Damage:** Outside battle, poisoned Pokémon lose 1 HP every 4 steps.

## Defeated Trainers Log
*   OAK'S LAB - Rival Pixel
