# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Current Task
- **Status**: Standing at (10, 11). Sprite ahead at (10, 12).
- **Correction**: Previous turn failed to open menu (Moved instead).
- **Immediate**: Open Bag -> Heal Garnet -> Interact with Sprite.
- **Plan**: `Start` -> `Down` x2 -> `A` (Open Pack).
- **Goal**: Escape via B1F (Trigger event).

### Party Status
- Garnet (32) [Critical], Basil (9), Amethyst (10) [Fainted], Spinarak (14), Topaz (15) [Fainted], Harrz (14) [Fainted].

### Reflection & Plan
- **Reflection**: I've been hallucinating exits. `find_reachable_exits` confirmed I am trapped. I must rely on game mechanics (triggers/holes) rather than hoping for walls to disappear.
- **Eusine**: He ran away to the SE. Following his path might reveal the way.
- **Plan**: Move South to (10, 10). Search adjacent tiles.
- **Route**: (10, 5) -> South to (10, 10).
