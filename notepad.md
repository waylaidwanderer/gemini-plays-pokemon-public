# Hall of Fame Entry
- **Achievement:** **CHAMPION OF THE JOHTO LEAGUE!**
- **Date:** Turn 33314
- **MVP:** Muscle (Machoke) Lv88.

# Reflection (Turn 34888)
- **Execution:** Fly Map navigation has failed for 10+ turns. Horizontal inputs (Left/Right from Ecruteak) are being ignored or dropped. Vertical (Down to Goldenrod) works.
- **Hygiene:** Notepad is clean. Map markers are good.
- **Strategy:** Hard reset required. Closing Fly Map to reset cursor state.
- **Hypothesis:** Rapid inputs or specific axis transitions are bugged/laggy. Will retry with single, verified inputs after reset.
- **Contingency:** If Fly continues to fail, I will walk to Olivine via Route 38 (West Gate).

# Roamer Hunt Log
- **Session Start:** Turn 34090.
- **Action:** Opening Fly Map (from Silver Cave).
- **Status:** Unexpectedly landed at Silver Cave (Map 19_2).
- **Goal:** Fly to Goldenrod City (or Blackthorn/Violet) to restock.
- **Plan:** Open Map -> Verify cursor location -> Plan precise navigation next turn.
- **Note:** Discarding previous assumptions about map connections. Will verify step-by-step.
- **Pattern:** Circle grass (16 steps) -> Shuffle Ecruteak -> Repeat.
- **Lead:** Gyarados (Lv36) < Roamer (Lv40). Repel works.
- **Sighting:** Route 38 & Route 42 (Verified Turn 34605).
