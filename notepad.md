# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- PIT: Impassable. Falling into a pit warps the player to the floor below (1F).
- LADDER: Warp to the floor below (1F).
- BOULDER: Object. Can be pushed with Strength. Impassable.

# Blackthorn Gym Discovery
- The boulder puzzle is skippable! A clear path exists along the right side of the gym: (8, 7) -> (9, 7) -> (9, 3) -> (6, 3).
- I am currently standing at (6, 3) facing Clair at (5, 3).

# Battle Preparation: Clair
- Team Status: Calcifer (Lv47), Gneiss (Lv45) are the heavy hitters.
- Clair's Team (Expected): Dragonair x3, Kingdra.
- Strategy: Use Calcifer's Thunderpunch for coverage and Gneiss's Earthquake for raw power.
- Note: Be prepared for a long battle.
