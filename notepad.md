# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Goal:** Check for credits, then continue completing the Pokedex.
- **Location:** Route 22 (Map 23_2).
- **Post-Red Status:** Team fully healed automatically.
- **Next Stop:** Viridian City -> Pallet Town.
- **Immediate Task:** Defeat Schoolboy Danny (Electabuzz).
- **Status:** In Battle. Muscle (Lv 85) vs Electabuzz.
- **Action:** Keep Muscle in (Select NO). Use Strength.
- **Reasoning:** Muscle Lv 85 > Electabuzz. Strength is physical (uses high Atk) and 100% accurate. Cross Chop is overkill/low PP.
- **Aftermath:** Jump ledge at (5, 13) and continue South to Pallet Town.
