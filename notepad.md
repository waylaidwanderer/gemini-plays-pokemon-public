# Gem's Strategic Plan & Learnings

## 1. Core Protocols
*   **Pre-Adventure Checklist:** Before major undertakings, use `pre_adventure_checker_agent`.
*   **Trainer Scouting:** Mark defeated trainers on the map IMMEDIATELY.
*   **Pathfinding:** For complex areas, use `pathfinding_agent` or `exploration_helper_agent` to plot a course and FOLLOW IT.
*   **Agent Management:** Keep one agent slot open for flexibility.

## 2. Key Learnings & Mechanics
*   **Poison Damage:** 1 HP per 4 steps outside of battle.
*   **BITE Move:** Normal-type.
*   **Defeated Trainers:** They are solid obstacles.
*   **Location Verification:** Trust Game State, not memory.
*   **Route 3 Navigation:** This route is a maze of ledges and one-way paths. Do not assume a path exists without visual confirmation or using a pathfinding agent. Got lost for ~20 turns in the SE corner.

## 3. World Clues & Objectives
*   Team Rocket is at **Mt. Moon**.
*   Moon Stones are found in **Mt. Moon**.
*   The path to Cerulean City is likely through Mt. Moon.

## 4. Active Hypotheses
*   **Hypothesis:** The Mt. Moon entrance is at the east end of Route 3.
    *   **Test:** Navigate to the eastern exit of Route 3.

## 5. Immediate Tasks
*   Find the Pok√©mon Center at Mt. Moon to heal the party.

## 6. Major Blunders & Resets
*   **Route 3 Maze Failure (Turn ~4300):** Got completely lost in the SE corner after jumping down ledges. Wasted ~50 turns and critically injured the party. Concluded that this area is a trap and the main path is elsewhere. **Strategy:** Executing a strategic blackout to reset at Pewter City and attempt the route again, avoiding the lower ledges.
