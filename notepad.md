# Navigation Log: Fly to Ecruteak
- Attempt 1 (Turns 45133-45150): Multiple failures due to menu cursor persistence and landing in wrong cities (Violet, Cherrygrove).
- Attempt 2 (Turn 45152): Chad's phone call interrupted the sequence, leading to the Option menu.
- Current Status: Exiting Option menu to retry Fly.
- Strategy: Reset cursor with multiple 'Up' presses before selecting Pokemon menu.
