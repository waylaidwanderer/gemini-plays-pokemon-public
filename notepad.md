# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard ground. Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Surf required. Traversable.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- DOOR: Warp point.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable cliff face (e.g., Row 15, Row 30, Row 34).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
- BREAKABLE ROCK: Requires Rock Smash. Impassable.
- NPC: Impassable. Interact from adjacent tile.

# Blocked Routes (Verified)
- Central City: Vertical wall at X=9 (Rows 34-37). Cliff at Row 30.
- Plateau Access: Row 29 is a clear East-West path from X=19 to X=2, bypassing the Row 30 cliff and city walls.

# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The Row 29 Skyline Path
- Plan:
  1. Use Super Repel. [DONE]
  2. Walk West to (12, 30), then North to (12, 29). [IN PROGRESS]
  3. Walk West along Row 29 to (2, 29).
  4. Walk North along West Beach to (2, 14).
  5. Walk East to (8, 14), then North to (8, 12).
  6. Walk East along Row 12 to (14, 12), then North to (14, 10).
- Status: At (19, 30) on land.
- Reasoning: Row 29 and Row 12 are identified as the only continuous horizontal paths through the city's vertical blockades and cliff faces.

# General Lessons
- City Layouts: In Johto cities like Cianwood, horizontal paths (Rows) often bypass vertical blockades (Walls) even if they look like a maze. Always check the full length of a Row for gaps.
