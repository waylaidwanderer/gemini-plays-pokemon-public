## Strategy: Terrestrial Bypass to Suicune
**Start Turn:** 48900 (Quest: Trigger Suicune Overworld Sighting)

Cianwood's internal walls (X=9, X=7, X=5) must be bypassed using specific gaps:

2. X=5 Wall Gap: Row 35 (Target: (2, 35))

### Step-by-Step Execution Plan
1. Walk West to the X=12 corridor at (12, 32). <- CURRENT TASK
2. Walk South to (12, 44).
3. Walk West to (8, 44), bypassing the X=9 wall.
4. Walk North to (8, 35).
5. Walk West to (2, 35), bypassing the X=5 wall.
6. Walk North along the West Beach Highway (X=2) to (2, 14).
7. Walk East to (8, 14), then North to (8, 10).
8. Walk East to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune sighting.
