3. Move West to (10, 49) and South to (10, 51) via gap at (10, 50).
4. Walk West along Row 51 to X=2 corridor.
5. Walk North along X=2 to Row 12 (bypasses Row 15 ledge).

# Progress Notes
- Dead End Pocket: (12-19, 46-49) blocks South/West exit at Row 49/50. Must exit via Row 46, 48, or 50 gaps.
- Verified: Row 46 gap (18, 46), Row 48 gap (12, 48), and Row 50 gap (10, 50) are the keys to the southern loop.
