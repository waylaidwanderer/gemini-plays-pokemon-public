# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The West Beach Land Route (Verified)
- Plan:
  1. Surf to (20, 32) and land at (19, 32). [IN PROGRESS]
  2. Walk to (5, 35) via Row 33/35 to bypass city walls.
  3. Walk to (2, 30) via the gap at (3, 31).
  4. Walk North along the X=2 corridor to Row 10.
  5. Walk East to (14, 10).
- Status: At (27, 13) surfing, heading to the landing spot.
- Reasoning: Direct northern access is blocked by cliff walls. The city layout contains a series of gaps (X=17, X=8, X=5, X=3) that allow a zig-zag path to the clear West Beach corridor (X=2). This corridor is clear of ledges all the way to Suicune's plateau.
