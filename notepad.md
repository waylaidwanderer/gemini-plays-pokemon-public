## Agent Strategy & Ideas
### Active Agent Ideas:
1.  **Level Cap Compliance Agent**: Checks Pok√©mon levels against current cap. (To be defined this turn)
2.  **Viridian Forest Navigator**: Helps navigate Viridian Forest. (Future idea)
3.  **Obstacle Aware Path Planner**: Simpler pathfinder aware of temporary obstacles. (Future idea)

### Discontinued Agents:
-   `route_pathfinder`: Consistently failed.
-   `exploration_prioritizer_agent`: Often gave unhelpful suggestions.

### General Agent Notes:
-   Ensure system prompts are robust and include all necessary game context.
-   Input schemas should not include auto-provided variables like `map_xml_string` for code-enabled agents.

## World Knowledge Graph (WKG) Best Practices
- Record inter-map transitions (map boundary, warps) immediately using `manage_world_knowledge`.
- Use descriptive names and tags for nodes.
- Include exact coordinates and connection types.
- Note `destination_entry_point` for warps when known.

## Map Marker Best Practices
- Mark defeated trainers (‚ò†Ô∏è), used warps (üö™), key info NPCs (üí°), signs (‚ÑπÔ∏è), obstacles (üöß), items given by NPCs (üéÅ).
- Use distinct emojis and concise labels. Delete redundant markers.

## Lessons Learned & Strategy Refinements
-   **Trust Game State**: GSI is absolute truth for dynamic data (NPCs, items).
-   **Pathing**: Double-check tile types (especially ledges) before committing to a path. NPCs can block movement. My pathing on Route 2 around the sign and ledges needs more care.
-   **Critical Path**: Prioritize objectives that unblock main progression (e.g., Old Man in Viridian) before extensive detours like Route 22.
-   **Efficiency**: Plan longer movement sequences. Avoid repeated interactions if the first attempt yields no new info.
-   **Hypothesis Testing**: Form hypotheses, test systematically, document failures and attempt counts.
-   **Route 22**: Was a detour. Path to Pewter is North from Viridian City via Route 2 / Viridian Forest.
-   **Mart Exit (Viridian)**: Exits to (30,21) outside Mart, not School House.
