# Advisor Recommendations (Turn 43175)
- **Urgent:** Heal KIMCHI and the party.
- **Grinding:** Aim for Level 75+ for the entire team to match Red.
- **Team Composition:** Consider replacing low-level ICARUS (19) and XENON (44) with stronger counters for Blastoise and Snorlax.
- **Tactics:** GNEISS is key for Pikachu/Charizard. Equip Calcifer with status-curing berries.

5. Head south to exit at (9, 67).
