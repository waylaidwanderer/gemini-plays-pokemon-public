### Immediate Goals
1. **Find Floria**: Go to National Park/Route 36 (near Sudowoodo) and talk to the NPC (likely Floria).
2. **Get SquirtBottle**: Return to Goldenrod Flower Shop after finding Floria.
3. **Move Sudowoodo**: Use SquirtBottle on the tree to clear the path to Ecruteak.

### Quest Log
- **Badges**: Zephyr, Hive, Plain.
- **Party**: All Healthy.
