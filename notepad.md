## Area and Navigation Insights
### Tile Traversal and Movement Rules
- **Objects are impassable:** All map objects (items, trees, signs, etc.) act as walls.
- WALL: An impassable barrier.
- FLOOR: A standard traversable tile. **Correction:** This tile is NOT always traversable. For example, floor tiles with flowers are impassable walls. The floor in Elm's Lab is traversable.
- TALL_GRASS: A traversable tile that can trigger wild Pokémon encounters.
- LEDGE: Impassable from the bottom edge. Can be jumped down from the top edge.
- FLOOR_HOP_RIGHT_LEDGE: A one-way tile that allows jumping over a ledge to the right.
- FLOOR_HOP_LEFT_LEDGE: A one-way tile that allows jumping over a ledge to the left.
- FLOOR_HOP_DOWN_LEDGE: A one-way tile that allows jumping over a ledge downwards.
- FLOOR_HOP_DOWN_OR_RIGHT_LEDGE: A one-way tile that allows jumping over a ledge either down or to the right.
- FLOOR_HOP_DOWN_OR_LEFT_LEDGE: A one-way tile that allows jumping over a ledge either down or to the left.
- HEADBUTT_TREE: An impassable wall.
- CUT_TREE: An impassable wall. (Requires HM Cut - Assumption)
- COUNTER: An impassable barrier.
- DOOR: A warp tile.
- WATER: An impassable tile without HM Surf.
- MART_SHELF: An impassable barrier.
- BUOY: An impassable tile in water.
- TOWN_MAP: Impassable object.
- WINDOW: Impassable object.
- BOOKSHELF: Impassable object.
- TV: Impassable object.
- RADIO: Impassable object.
- VOID: An impassable tile outside the map boundaries.

## Critical Issues
### Tool Limitations
- **pathfinder_pro is unreliable:** The tool cannot distinguish between visually different tiles of the same type (e.g., normal FLOOR vs. impassable flowered FLOOR). Do not use it on maps with such features; rely on manual pathing instead.
