# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable. [Verified]
- WALL: Impassable. [Verified]
- WATER: Traversable via Surf (Ravioli). [Verified]
- HEADBUTT_TREE: Impassable. [Verified]
- CUT_TREE: Impassable. Requires HM01 Cut (KIMCHI). [Verified]
- PC: Standard interaction. [Verified]
- COUNTER: Impassable. Interaction with NPCs behind them must be done from an adjacent tile. [Verified]
- WARP_CARPET: Traversable, triggers map transition. [Verified]
- LEDGE: One-way traversal. Blocks movement from the direction it hops into. [Verified]
- FRUIT_TREE: Impassable. [Verified]

# Suicune Sighting Log (Crystal)

# Lessons Learned
- Lesson: Route 42 Suicune trigger (Sighting 3) is not guaranteed by a simple approach to the island trees. 100% tile sweep of the island grove (Turn 22782-22883) failed to trigger the event.
- Hypothesis: The trigger may require a 'Map Reset' (leaving and re-entering Route 42 from Ecruteak) or is located on a specific water tile bordering the island.
- Timestamp: Suicune Hunt Phase 3 (Route 42) started Turn 22256. Currently Turn 22891 (635 turns elapsed).
