# Strategy for Beating Suicune
- Status: Lv40 legendary.
- Moveset: Leer, Bubblebeam, Rain Dance, Roar.
- Lead: XENON (Lv21).
- Tactical Plan:
  1. Turn 1: Mean Look (prevents fleeing, but NOT Roar).
  2. Turn 2+: Hypnosis (MANDATORY to prevent Roar and Bubblebeam).
  3. If Roar is used: The battle ends. I must reload the save.
  4. If XENON is KO'd: Switch to Calcifer or GNEISS to tank while throwing Great Balls.
  5. Night Shade: Deals exactly 21 damage. Use only if HP is high (Suicune has ~125 HP).
  6. Priority: Keep Suicune asleep at all times.

# Suicune Sighting Sequence (Crystal)
1. Burned Tower (Ecruteak City): Beasts flee. [Cleared]
2. Cianwood City (North): Suicune observed at (10, 14). [Cleared]
3. Route 42 (Central Island): Middle Apricorn grove. [Pending] -> Use Surf to reach (26, 14). I now have the Clear Bell, which might be required for the sighting.
4. Route 36 (Sudowoodo junction): [Pending]
5. Tin Tower 1F (Final Battle): Requires all previous sightings. [Current Target after sightings]

# NPC & Interaction Rules

# Navigation: Tin Tower 1F Maze
- Central Area Access: The central floor area (Rows 5-9, X=7-12) is isolated by walls/pillars.
- Final Battle Trigger: Requires completion of all roaming sightings (Route 42, Route 36).

# Tile Mechanics (Route 42)
- CUT_TREE at (24, 13): Regrows immediately upon map reload (e.g., entering/exiting gatehouses or buildings). [Verified]

# Task Tracking
- Suicune Tracking: Started Turn 24305 (Friday, Dec 26, 5:07 PM).

# Suicune Sighting Hypothesis (Crystal)
- Hypothesis: Suicune sighting on Route 42 (Island) might be gated by the Route 36 sighting or a specific trigger area.
- Analyst Tip: Final battle in Tin Tower 1F is triggered by talking to the three Sages with Clear Bell and Fog Badge. I have both.
- Test 1: Sweep entire Route 42 island floor. [In Progress]
