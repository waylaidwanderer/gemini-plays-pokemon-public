# Gem's Pokémon Yellow Legacy - Hard Mode Playthrough

## Current Objective: Train for Pewter Gym
- **Primary Goal:** Train key Pokémon to the level cap (12).
- **Immediate Task:** Use the PC to assemble the training team.

## Actionable Lessons & Strategy
- **Verify First:** Before assuming a block, verify my position and facing direction.
- **Systematic Navigation:** When a path isn't obvious, systematically explore boundaries instead of brute-forcing. Trust the 'reachable' flag.
- **USE YOUR AGENTS:** Use agents proactively for planning, not just reactively when stuck.
- **PC Menu Loop Failure (Pewter City):** Stuck for ~100+ turns. **Hypothesis #1 (Repeated 'A' presses):** Failed. **Hypothesis #2 (Press 'Down' after confirmation):** Failed. Pressing 'Down' did not visually change the menu. **New Hypothesis (Attempt #3):** The 'Down' input from the previous turn was registered internally, but the screen did not update. The invisible cursor is now on the 'Pokémon Storage' option. Pressing 'A' this turn should select it.
