# Suicune Capture Strategy
## The Repel Trick
- Lead: KIMCHI (Lv 21 Gloom).
- Method: Super Repel filters wild Pokemon (Lv 13-16). Suicune (Lv 40) is the only possible encounter.
- Status: Super Repel active (Used Turn #13611). ~1-20 steps remaining (Verified Turn #13645).
- Pacing Progress: 200/? steps taken. Hunt started Turn #13189. Current Turn #13646.
- Inventory: Super Repel x5 remaining (Item 15 in PACK).
- Strategy: Resume pacing at (25, 7). Expect flee on Turn 1; persistence is required to land Sleep Powder.

## Battle Strategy
- Target: Suicune (Lv 40, Base Speed 85).
- Lead: KIMCHI (Lv 21, Base Speed 40).
- Mechanics: Suicune flees on Turn 1. It outspeeds Gloom.
- Plan: Inflict Sleep (Sleep Powder) to prevent fleeing in subsequent encounters. HP and status are persistent.
- Catch Rate: ~0.39% (Full HP, No Status, Great Ball). Increases to ~4.3% if asleep.
- Contingency: If progress stalls, catch a faster Pokémon with Sleep/Mean Look (e.g. Haunter/Golbat).

## Route 38 Environment
- Roamer Logic: Suicune moves routes ONLY when crossing map boundaries (Route 38/39 edge), using Fly, or after a battle.
- Boundary: Route 38 (0, 10) <-> Route 39 (19, 10).
- Location: Verified on Route 38 (Turn #13640).

# Lessons Learned
- **Inventory Mechanics:** The Game State Information 'Items' list is ALPHABETICAL. The actual in-game PACK order is acquisition-based. Always verify item positions using screen text or visual cues before navigating menus.
- **Suicune Speed:** Suicune (Base Speed 85) outspeeds KIMCHI (Lv 21, Base Speed 40). It will flee on Turn 1 before Sleep Powder can be used. Persistence is key to eventually land a status condition, or a faster Pokémon is required.
- **Repel Verification:** To confirm if a Repel is active without wasting steps, try to use another one; the game will notify you if one is already in effect.
