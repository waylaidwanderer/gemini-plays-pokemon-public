# Suicune Quest Strategy: 'The Western Land Bypass'
- Goal: Reach Suicune at (7, 4).
- Fact: The northern part of the island (north beach) is accessible by land via the far western beach (X=0 to X=2). The buoy maze is a red herring.

    2. Walk West to (12, 30), then South to (12, 49) to bypass the city's one-way ledges.
    3. Walk West to (2, 49).
    4. Walk North along the far west coast to (2, 14).
    5. Walk East and North to the landing spot: (2, 14) -> (8, 14) -> (8, 12) -> (14, 12) -> (14, 10).
    6. Approach Suicune at (7, 4).
- Preparation: Lead with XENON (Haunter) for Hypnosis. Be ready for Eusine.
