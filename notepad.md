# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Navigation Notes
- **Goal**: Reach Goldenrod City West Side (Main Road).
- **Strategy**: Flank via Route 34.
- **Status**: Route 34 (11_1) at (13, 37). On the Main Path.
- **Correction**: The Daycare is at x=13 (Row 15), so I am on the correct side for the Daycare and Goldenrod.
- **Observation**: The fence at x=11 and x=16 channels the path here, but it likely opens up North.
- **Plan**: 
    1. Head North to the Daycare (Row 15).
    2. Check for access to the West grassy area (x < 10) to loop back for the Item Ball.
    3. Enter Goldenrod City.

### Resource Alert
- **Pokeballs**: 0 (Only 1 Lure Ball). Need to buy balls at Goldenrod Dept Store.

### Key Locations
- **Sister's House**: (29, 5).
- **Flower Shop**: (19, 1). Needs Sudowoodo interaction.
- **Gym**: (24, 7).
- **Route 34 Exit**: South edge (Row 35).
- **Tracks**: West edge (Column 3-4).
- **Underground Entrances**: South at (11, 29), North presumably near Game Corner (9, 5).

### Quests
- **Sister's House**: (29, 5). The sister is missing (Route 36).
- **Route 35 Gatehouse**: East Side (x=31) is a dead end.
- **Plan**: Traverse Underground from South (11, 29) to North (9, 5). Exit and proceed to Route 35.
- **Reasoning**: Surface routes blocked. Underground is the only viable bypass.
- **Objective**: Reach North-West corner for Route 35.

### Status
- Badges: 3 (Zephyr, Hive, Plain).
- Party: Quilava (26), Sentret (2), Bellsprout (6), Togepi (5), Rattata (8).
- Route 34 Navigation: To reach the Daycare, travel North along the West path (main road) and enter the yard through the gap in the fence at (11, 15). Watch out for the Officer at (10, 16).
- Route 34 Item Ball at (7, 30) is blocked by a ledge at x=9 (One-way West->East?). Must approach from Goldenrod City/West side.
- Confirmed: Wall at x=35 blocks East access from Row 6-19.
- Tracks blocked at (3, 16) by Rude Tourist.
- Status: Returning to Underground (South Entrance).
- Plan: Go East to Main Road (x=18) -> South to Row 23 -> West to x=9 -> South to Row 29 -> Enter Underground (11, 29).
- Reasoning: Surface paths North (Main Road & Tracks) are blocked. Underground is the proven path to the North side.
- Note: Sandbox is down. Manual navigation active.
- **Transition**: Goldenrod (18, 35) connects to Route 34 (8, 0).
- **Plan**: Move West in Route 34 to finding the Tracks entrance (likely x=4 or lower).
- **Status**: Route 34 (11_1) at (9, 0). East side.
- **Hypothesis**: The large block of walls at Row 3-5 (Columns 4-7) is likely the Gatehouse structure. The Main Road is to the West (Columns 0-3).
- **Plan**: 
    1. Go South to Row 8 (where the barrier at x=7 ends).
    2. Move West into the Unseen area (Columns 0-3).
    3. Head North to enter Goldenrod from the Main Road.
- **Reasoning**: To access the West side of Goldenrod, I must be on the West side of the Gatehouse.
- **Timestamp**: Turn 8355.
- **Reasoning**: The city is divided by vertical walls. The only reliable crossover point seems to be the very bottom (Row 35).
- **Timestamp**: Turn 8337.
- **Status**: Goldenrod Dept Store 2F (11_12). Purchasing 10 Poké Balls.
- **Action**: Confirming purchase (¥2000).
- **Goal**: Buy Standard Poké Balls.
- **Correction**: No Premier Ball bonus in Gen 2. Just buying 10 Standard Balls.
- **Next**: Exit store and head North to Route 36.
