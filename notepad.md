## Reflection (Turn 27298)
1. **Immediate Execution:** I have been looping between Ecruteak and Route 42. I need to conclusively verify Route 36.
2. **Notepad Hygiene:** Added this reflection section. Tracking Suicune sightings is the priority.
3. **Map Hygiene:** Cleaned up mislabeled "Wise Trio" markers in Gatehouse (4_1).
4. **Automation:** Suicune tracker is helpful but I must verify its claims (e.g., "already defeated") with my own battle history.
5. **Goal Clarity:** Pivot to Route 36 sighting.
6. **Error Analysis:** My root hypothesis that the Wise Trio is defeated is based on the tracker, but I haven't seen the battle. I will verify sightings first.

- **Current Strategy:** If Route 36 doesn't trigger, I will revisit Route 42 middle area and interact with everything.
