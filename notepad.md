# Current Strategy: Ascend Western Waterfall
- **Start Turn:** 26699 (Jan 7, 2026)
- **Location:** Silver Cave Room 2 (3_75)
- **Status:** Closing menu, moving to test Left Waterfall.
- **Position:** Moving from (11, 30) to (7, 30).
- **Correction:** x=11 rejected "Waterfall" from the menu. It is NOT the climbable tile.
- **Hypothesis:** I must successfully interact with the Left Waterfall (x=7) *without* moving into it (which triggers the current).
- **Plan:**
  1. Move to (7, 30).
  2. Face UP.
  3. Press A (or use Menu) *without* pressing UP.
  4. Ascend.

# Key Findings
- **Waterfall Mechanics:**
  - Moving UP into a waterfall tile pushes you back (Current).
  - To climb, you must interact (A) from the tile *below*, facing UP.
  - x=11 is NOT climbable.
  - Likely climbable spot: x=7 (the main channel).
