# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement (acting as a ledge). Passable from SOUTH to NORTH. Verified: Row 48 and Row 50 act as primary barriers.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at Row 15 (X=3-17).
- ROCK: Smashable rocks act as WALLs.
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
## Strategy: The Great Southern Bypass
Reach (14, 10) by bypassing all internal obstacles via the far southern and western corridors.
1. Move West along Row 45 to (18, 45) and South to (18, 46) (Gap 1).
2. Move West along Row 47 to (12, 47) and South to (12, 48) (Gap 2).
3. Move West along Row 49 to (10, 49) and South to (10, 50) (Gap 3).
4. Move South to Row 51 and West to (2, 51) (Western Corridor Highway).
5. Move North along X=2 to (2, 12).
6. Move East along Row 12 to (14, 12) and North to (14, 10).

# Progress Notes
- Verified: Row 51 is a clear horizontal path from X=24 to X=4, bypassing all internal walls.
- Verified: X=2 corridor is a clear vertical path from Row 51 to Row 12.
- Verified: Row 12 is a clear horizontal path from X=2 to X=14.
- Blocked: Sea Route is restricted by complex buoy walls and landing point barriers.
- Blocked: Internal corridors are segmented by walls and south-blocking ledges.
