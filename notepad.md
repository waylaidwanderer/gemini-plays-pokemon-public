# Ice Path Strategy
- **Current Action:** Navigating West along Row 14.
- **Goal:** Reach (15, 14) and check the Ice patch to the North.
- **Reasoning:**
  - The path west along Row 14 leads to (15, 14).
  - To the North at (15, 13) is ICE. This likely leads into the large western ice room.
  - I need to find a Ladder to B1F.
- **Items:** Item Balls at (32, 23), (35, 9), (31, 7).

# Mechanics & Lessons
- **Ice Physics:** Sliding continues until collision.
- **Ledges:** `FLOOR_UP_WALL` tiles are impassable walls from South.

# Map Structure
- **West:** Entrance (Route 44) & Large Ice Room?
- **Center:** Hub.
- **East:** Winding corridors.
