# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026
- Current Location: National Park (Map 3_15)

### Immediate Goals
1. **Find Floria**: Explore the North-East corner of the National Park.
2. **Find Exit to Route 36**: Likely in the North-East.
3. **Get SquirtBottle**: Return to Flower Shop after finding Floria.

### Quest Log
- **Badges**: Zephyr, Hive, Plain.
- **Party**: All Healthy (Garnet Poisoned).
- **Mail Quest**: Active.
- **Contest**: Not entered (lack of Sport Balls/Bug Catching logic).

### Strategic Notes
- **Poison Alert**: Garnet is poisoned. No Antidote in bag. Prioritize reaching a Pokemon Center (Violet City East?) or finding Floria quickly.
- **SquirtBottle**: Requires Plain Badge (Have), inspecting tree (Done), and finding Floria.
- **Map Intel**: "North Gate" at (25,3) was invalid. Heading South-East to find the East Exit (Route 36).
### Reflection (Turn 11582)
- **Map Mechanics**: Row 8 connects East and West sides of Route 35. Row 5/6 have walls (TYPE_2889).
- **Correction**: TYPE_2889 is a Wall/Impassable. Do not use in pathfinding.
- **Plan**: Escape battle -> Walk West to X=3 on Row 8 -> Walk North to Gatehouse at (3,5).
- **Status**: Garnet Poisoned (52 HP). Urgency: High. Battle with Nidoran.
