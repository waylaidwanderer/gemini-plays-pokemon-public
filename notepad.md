# General Lessons
- Buoy layouts in water channels often create dead-end pockets (e.g., Row 10 in Cianwood). Always verify the northern/southern exits before committing.
- City layouts with many ledges (like Cianwood) are best navigated by finding a perimeter path or water approach.
- `FLOOR_UP_WALL` tiles typically block movement into the ledge from the south. Document verified directions in the Tile Mechanics section.
- Trust but verify: If multiple land paths fail, re-examine the map for isolated areas reachable only by water.
