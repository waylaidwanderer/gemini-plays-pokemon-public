# Suicune Capture Strategy
## Strategy: The Mean Look Pivot
- Train XENON (Gastly) to Lv 13 to learn Mean Look. (COMPLETE)
- Evolve to Haunter (Lv 25) and train to ~Lv 38-40 (Speed 73-110) to outspeed Suicune.
- Lead with Haunter: Mean Look (Turn 1) -> Hypnosis -> Ultra Balls.
- Track Suicune using Pokedex AREA map. Cycle between adjacent routes to force movement.
- Item Goal: Buy Ultra Balls at Goldenrod or Blackthorn Marts.

## Lessons Learned & Verified Mechanics
- Cursor Persistence: Battle move menu remembers selection. Always verify cursor position.
- Menu Navigation: Start, Party, and Battle menus wrap. Use relative navigation.
- Tool Usage: Refine custom tools immediately if they fail. Use manual inputs to progress in battle.
- Tile Collision: NPCs, certain trees, and ledges block paths. Use 'run_code' to verify navigability.
- Ghost-type: Immune to Normal/Fighting moves. Lick (Ghost) is ineffective against Normal-types.
- Hoppip: Immune to Ghost moves in this game version.
- Hypnosis: Fails if the target already has a status condition.
- Sweet Scent: Triggers immediate wild encounters on valid grass tiles.
- Floor Up Wall: One-way pathing (traversable North, impassable South).
