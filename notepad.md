# Suicune Strategy (Crystal Version)
- Mechanics Check: In Crystal, Suicune has fixed overworld sprite locations and is NOT a random grass encounter until the final stationary battle at Tin Tower.
- Encounter Sequence:
    1. Burned Tower: Trigger beasts to flee. (COMPLETED)
    2. Cianwood City: North end town. (COMPLETED)
    3. Route 42: Island in the middle (requires Surf and Cut). (IN PROGRESS - Stagnated)
    4. Kanto Route 14: Near the water. (FUTURE)
    5. Tin Tower: Stationary battle with Clear Bell. (FUTURE)
- Battle Plan: Lead XENON (Gastly, Lv21) with Mean Look. Strategy: Mean Look -> Hypnosis -> weaken.
- Stagnation Plan: If island sweep fails, check Tin Tower in Ecruteak. Backup: Return to Cianwood to ensure Eusine dialogue finished.
