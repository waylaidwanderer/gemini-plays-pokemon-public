# Tile Mechanics
- **COUNTER:** impassable (blocks movement).
- **TALL_GRASS:** traversable, chance of wild encounter.
- **HEADBUTT_TREE:** solid (collision), chance of encounter if Headbutt is used.
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN:** one-way traversable (down only).
- **WALL:** impassable.
- **FLOOR:** traversable.

# Lessons Learned
- **Fly Mechanics:** The Pokegear Map is view-only. Must use Party -> Fly to travel.
- **Fly Map Navigation:** 'Up' moves West (New Bark -> Cherrygrove). 'Down' moves East/North (Cherrygrove -> New Bark -> Blackthorn). Navigation seems to follow a specific path rather than direct D-pad movement.
- **Automation Limits:** Long macro tools crossing map boundaries are unreliable. Use short, verifiable sequences.
