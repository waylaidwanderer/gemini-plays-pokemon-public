- Pikachu (Lv81): Defeated by GNEISS.
- Espeon (Lv73): Defeated (Turn 43777).
- XENON (Haunter): Active. HP 111/111. Dream Eater PP: 0/15. Night Shade PP: 15/15.
- Snorlax (Lv75): Active. Asleep (Turn 43863 via Rest).

- GORP (Snorlax): Benched. HP 141/221.
- Inventory: 4 Full Restores, 8 Max Potions, 18 Revives, 12 Full Heals, 1 Elixer.
- Strategy: Use Elixer to restore Dream Eater PP. Night Shade has no effect on Snorlax (Normal-type). Haunter is immune to Snorlax's Normal attacks. Maintain Haunter to wall Snorlax safely.
- Observation: Snorlax woke up and immediately used Rest again at Turn 43863. It's back to full HP.
- Note: Snorlax is immune to Ghost-type moves (Night Shade). Psychic moves (Dream Eater) work. Snorlax has no moves to hit Haunter (Body Slam and Snore are Normal). Currently on Turn 1 of sleep (Turn 43867).
- Battle Progress: Snorlax is a complete wall to Haunter. This is a safe but slow victory. Night Shade was a mistake; must use Dream Eater. Restoring PP with Elixer is necessary.
