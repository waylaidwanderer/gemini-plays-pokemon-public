# Lessons Learned
- **Tool Insight:** `navigate_menu` `hold_ms` is tricky. `Right` from Mahogany failed consistently.
- **Automation vs. Interruptions:** Phone calls/events freeze the game, desyncing fixed-input sequences. Monitor and manually reset.
- **Efficiency:** "Checking with your face" (running into grass) is faster than checking the Pokedex for Roamers.
- **Fly Map Logic:**
  - `Violet -> Up` -> Ecruteak.
  - `Ecruteak -> Right` -> Mahogany.
  - `Mahogany -> Right` -> ??? (Failed).
- **Current Strategy:** Cursor is stuck on Mahogany. Flying there is better than walking from Ecruteak. Will Surf/Walk East to Blackthorn from Mahogany.
