## I. Core Protocols & Immediate Actions (v43053)
- **CRITICAL: Immediate Data Management:** I will use `manage_world_knowledge` and `define_map_marker` on the *same turn* a discovery is made. Deferring tasks is a critical failure.
- **CRITICAL: WKG Protocol (v29 - Manual & Corrected):** My previous protocol was based on hallucinated tools. The correct, manual process is: **Turn 1:** Add the source node using `manage_world_knowledge`. **Turn 2:** Add the destination node using `manage_world_knowledge`. **Turn 3:** Add the edge connecting them using `manage_world_knowledge`, manually constructing the JSON payload by querying the WKG for the node IDs. This is the highest priority action after a map transition.
- **CRITICAL: Map Marker Protocol (v12):** Mark defeated trainers, **used warps (entry and exit)**, picked up items, and confirmed dead ends *immediately*. **DO NOT MARK MAP-EDGE TRANSITIONS.**
- **CRITICAL: Agent & Tool Protocol (v8):** Agents are for **reasoning and high-level strategy**. Computational tasks (e.g., pathfinding, data parsing) MUST be handled by `run_code` or a custom tool defined with `define_tool`.

## II. Game Mechanics & Battle Intel
### A. Confirmed ROM Hack Changes
- **Type Matchups:** Psychic > Ghost/Poison, Ghost > Psychic, Bite (Normal) > Psychic, Normal !> Psychic, Electric > Rock/Water, CUT (Normal) > VICTREEBEL (Grass/Poison), Flying > Grass/Poison (super-effective), Electric !> Grass.
- **Type Immunities:** Psychic is immune to Electric. Flying-type is immune to Ground-type moves. MUK is immune to Poison-type moves.
- **Status Ailments:** Rock/Ground-types are NOT immune to being poisoned by Poison-type moves.
- **Evasion Mechanics:** PSYWAVE, a move that should never miss, can fail against a target with extreme evasion boosts (e.g., multiple MINIMIZE uses).
- **Battle Mechanics:** Multi-hit moves (e.g., FURY ATTACK) are a critical threat and can bypass the "sturdy" effect of surviving on 1 HP.
- **Ghost-Type Effectiveness:** Ghost-type moves (like Lick) are effective against Rock/Ground-types.

### B. General Field Mechanics
- **'No Will to Fight' Mechanic:** A fainted Pokémon cannot be switched into battle.
- **Silph Co. Blackout:** Losing in Silph Co. *does* cause a blackout and returns you to the last used Pokémon Center.
- **Saffron City Navigation:** The city's layout is segmented. Using FLY is the most efficient method for traveling between distant points.
- **HM & Field Move Mechanics:** Flash, Cut, and Fly MUST be taught to a Pokémon to be used in the field. PC Interaction must be activated from the tile directly below the PC (Y+1), facing up.
- **EXP Distribution:** Experience is shared between the Pokémon that started the battle and any Pokémon that participated by switching in.
- **Battle Initiation Mechanics:** To battle a trainer on an adjacent tile, you must face them and press 'A' to interact.
- **NPC Interaction Catch:** Some NPCs, upon interaction, can trigger a Pokémon 'catch' event, adding the Pokémon directly to the player's Pokédex and party/PC. (Observed with Rocker in Safari Zone East Rest House giving a CHANSEY).
- **Safari Game Time Limit:** The Safari Game has a time limit. When it expires, the player is automatically warped back to the Safari Zone Gate.
- **PC Box Full Mechanic:** When a Pokémon is caught and the active PC box is full, the caught Pokémon is still sent to the PC, but a warning is displayed. I must remember to manually change the active box at a Pokémon Center.
- **Eevee Evolution:** An NPC in the Safari Zone North Rest House mentioned that Eevee can evolve into Flareon or Vaporeon, suggesting multiple evolution paths likely influenced by evolution stones.

### C. Map Mechanics Discoveries
- **Map Segmentation:** Maps can be divided into isolated, non-contiguous segments. My `pathfinder` tool cannot navigate between these segments. Progress requires using intra-map warps to travel between them. (Confirmed for Safari Zone West & Center).
- **Invisible Walls:** Impassable walls that are not visually represented. Discovered in Silph Co. 9F at (12, 2), Safari Zone East at (17, 23), and Fuchsia Gym.
- **Hidden Passages:** Seemingly impassable tiles that are actually traversable. Discovered in Safari Zone East at (7, 25).
- **Impassable Roofs:** Building roofs, even if visually over traversable ground, can act as an impassable wall when approached from above. (Discovered on Route 19 at (6, 9)).
- **Summer Beach House Trap:** The house on Route 19 at (6, 10) is a one-way trap. The entrance warp is one-way, and Fly cannot be used to escape. The intended solution is to walk *through* Pikachu to reach the southern exit warp.
- **Elevation Traversal:** Movement between `ground` and `elevated_ground` tiles is only possible via `steps` tiles. Direct movement between them is blocked.

## III. System & Tool Development
### A. Tool Debugging & Refinement Protocol (v16 - IMMEDIATE ACTION)
- **CRITICAL:** If a custom tool is faulty, I MUST redefine and debug it on the IMMEDIATE next turn. **Abandoning a tool is a protocol violation.**
- **DEBUGGING STEP 1 (Advanced):** Use `run_code` with a modified pathfinding script. Print the `current` node inside the main loop to trace the BFS exploration path.
- **DEBUGGING STEP 2 (Advanced Analysis):** If no path is found, print the entire `came_from` dictionary to visualize the full explored area and identify the boundary where the pathfinding fails. This will confirm if the map is segmented.
- **DEBUGGING STEP 3 (Boundary Analysis):** If STEP 2 is insufficient, use a `run_code` script to parse the `came_from` dictionary and the `map_xml_string`. This script will identify all 'boundary tiles' (unexplored tiles adjacent to explored ones) and print their coordinates and tile types. This provides a definitive list of where the pathfinding algorithm is getting stuck.
- **DEBUGGING STEP 4:** Use `define_tool` to submit a corrected version of the script based on systematic analysis.

### B. Tool Development Ideas
- **Automated Explorer Agent:** An agent that can identify the nearest reachable unseen tile and automatically generate a path to an adjacent traversable tile. This would streamline my exploration process significantly.

## IV. Investigation & Hypothesis Log
- **Hypothesis:** The water areas in Safari Zone West, which I can now access with SURF and my updated `pathfinder`, contain the path forward or a key item.
- **Safari Zone Mechanics Testing (T41962):**
  - **Hypothesis:** Rock increases catch rate but also flee rate. Bait decreases flee rate but also catch rate.

## V. Defeated Bosses Log
- **Koga (Fuchsia Gym):** GOLBAT (Lv. 42), MUK (Lv. 42, knows MEGA DRAIN, ACID ARMOR), TENTACRUEL (Lv. 41, knows SURF, ICE BEAM), VENOMOTH (Lv. 43, knows PSYCHIC)
