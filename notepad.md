## Training Strategy
- Switch Training: Lead with strong PKMN, switch to trainee on Turn 1, then to finisher.

- Risk Assessment: Avoid switch-training against Bind/Wrap or high-defense (e.g. Onix) unless safe.

## Lessons Learned
- Ledge Mechanics: LEDGE_HOP_DOWN is one-way (South).
- Marker Hygiene: Use ☠️ for defeated trainers; delete 🚶/👤.
- UI Precision: Use select_battle_option for main menu; Up/Down only for moves.
- Switch Training Risk: High-defense or trapping move users (Bind, Wrap) are bad for low-level trainees.
- Battle Status: Verify status (Burn, Poison) carefully; don't assume from previous opponents.
