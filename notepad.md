# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement (acting as a ledge). Passable from SOUTH to NORTH.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at Row 15 (X=3-17).
- ROCK: Smashable rocks act as WALLs.
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- Started: Turn 49630
## Strategy: Sea Route Loop (Refined)
Reach (14, 10) by surfing through specific buoy and wall gaps.
1. Move South to (23, 16).
2. Move West to (19, 16) (Bypasses X=22 wall).
3. Move North to (19, 8) (Bypasses Row 9 wall).
4. Move West to (14, 8) (North of plateau).
5. Move South to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

# Progress Notes
- Blocked: X=22 wall is solid from Row 9 to Row 15.
- Blocked: Row 9 wall is solid from X=22 to X=26.
- Blocked: Row 15 land/wall is solid from X=12 to X=17.
- Verified: X=22 wall has gaps at Row 16-21.
- Verified: Row 9 wall has gaps at X=21 and below.
- Verified: Row 8 is a clear horizontal path north of the buoy walls.
- Hallucination Fix: (23, 15) is NOT a gap to the West (22, 15 is BUOY).
- Hallucination Fix: X=26 wall (Row 0-9) prevents eastern bypass.
