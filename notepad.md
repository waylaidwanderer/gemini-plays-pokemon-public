# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Current Status
- **Location**: Cianwood City (22_9), Inside Pharmacy.
- **Goal**: Get SecretPotion.
- **Status**: Battling Swimmer Kara (Pokemon 2: Starmie).
- **Reasoning**:
  1. Kara is sending out **Starmie**.
  2. Garnet (38/128 HP) is my only viable fighter.
  3. **Action**: declining the switch (Cursor on YES -> Press DOWN -> A).
  4. **Strategy**: 
     - Garnet is Lv 40. Starmie likely Lv 20-22. Garnet *should* outspeed.
     - Potion only heals 20 HP, likely less than Starmie's damage.
     - Best bet is to attack (Flame Wheel) and hope to 2HKO or OHKO before going down.
- **Plan**:
  1. Decline Switch.
  2. Select FLAME WHEEL.
  3. Win.
  4. Surf North.

### Objectives
- **Primary**: Obtain Mineral Badge (Jasmine).
- **Secondary**: Get SecretPotion (Cianwood).
- **Tertiary**: Train Basil to Lvl 21.

### Notes
- **Cianwood Pharmacy**: Supposed to have the SecretPotion.
- **Gym**: Chuck (Fighting). Weak to Psychic/Flying. Needs Strength (HM04) to reach.
- **Plan**:
  1. Get SecretPotion (Current).
  2. Buy Repels at General Store (22_3).
  3. Surf to Olivine City.
  4. Get HM04 (Strength) from Café.
  5. Climb Lighthouse, Heal Amphy.
  6. Defeat Jasmine (Steel) with Garnet.
  7. Return to Cianwood (Surf), Defeat Chuck, get Fly.
- **Shuckle Guy**: Found at (17, 41) in Cianwood (Map 22_4). Offers a Shuckle to look after.
- **Search Update**: Building at (17, 41) is NOT the Pharmacy. Pharmacy is likely South of the Pokemon Center.
- **Discovery**: Found a previously unnoticed door at (15, 37) in Cianwood.
- **Hypothesis**: This is likely the Pharmacy.
- **Plan**: Navigate to (15, 38) and enter.
