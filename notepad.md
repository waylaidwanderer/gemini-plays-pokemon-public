# Strategy: Trigger Suicune Sightings
- Goal: Complete sightings to trigger Tin Tower battle.
- Status: 16 Badges, Clear Bell.

## Suicune Chase Sequence (Crystal)
1. Burned Tower (Done)
2. Cianwood City (North Beach (14, 10)) <- CURRENT
3. Route 42
4. Kanto Route 14
5. Route 25
6. Tin Tower 1F

## Plan: Reach North Plateau (Started Turn 48972)
- Goal: Reach Suicune at (14, 10).
- Step 1: Reach (12, 28) and Surf. (Done)
- Step 2: Use Super Repel and Surf East to bypass Buoy Wall.
  - (12, 27) -> (12, 26) -> (20, 26) -> (20, 21) -> (23, 21). <- CURRENT TASK
- Step 3: Surf North through Buoy Gap at (23, 15).
- Step 4: Surf West and land on plateau at (16, 11).
- Step 5: Reach (14, 10) to trigger Suicune sighting.

# Area Notes
- Ledge (10, 15) blocks direct North path from town center.
- Buoy Wall at X=16-22 (Rows 15-20) blocks East path from town center.
- Buoy Gap at (23, 15) allows access to North Sea.
- North Plateau Landing: (16, 11) and (16, 12) are FLOOR tiles reachable from the North Sea.
- West Beach Path: (2, 35) to (2, 10) is also clear, but requires navigating a wall maze in town.

# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WATER: Requires Surf.
- BUOY: Impassable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
- ROCK: Smashable obstacle.

# Failed Hypotheses
- Attempting to walk North via (11, 15) gap: Leads to a 2-tile dead end at (10-11, 14) due to solid walls at Row 13.
- Attempting to walk to West Beach via Row 51: Blocked by unseen cliffs at Row 50.
- Positional Hallucination (Turn 49021): Corrected. Verified position at (19, 46) during detour attempt.
