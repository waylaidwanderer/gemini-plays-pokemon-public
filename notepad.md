## Strategy: Crossing Cianwood to Suicune
**Start Turn:** 48900 (Quest: Trigger Suicune Overworld Sighting)

The city walls (X=5 and X=7) have gaps that align at Row 48. This is the confirmed path to the West Beach.

### Step-by-Step Execution Plan
1. Return to Cianwood City via Route 41 warp at (0, 44).
2. Walk to the X=12 corridor and move Down to Row 48.
3. Walk West through the gaps at (7, 48) and (5, 48) to reach the West Beach.
4. Walk North along the beach to the plateau entrance.
5. Reach Suicune trigger point at (14, 10).

## Tile Mechanics: Cianwood City
- FLOOR: Standard traversable ground.
- WALL: Standard impassable barrier.
- WATER: Traversable only with Surf HM.
- BUOY: Impassable water barrier.
- DOOR: Warp point to building interior.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump South. Impassable from the North side.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable from the North. Behaves like a wall when moving Down into it (e.g., at (6, 46)).

## Failed Hypotheses & Lessons
- Great Sea Bypass: Route 40 is a dead end on the West. Surfing around the island via Route 41 is blocked by buoys at Row 50 and Row 0.
- Inner Channel North (X=13-17): Blocked at Row 15 by a solid wall of WALL tiles.
- City Corridor North: Blocked by recurring 'FLOOR_UP_WALL' barriers at Rows 46, 48, and 50.
- X=12 Corridor: Blocked at (12, 50) by 'FLOOR_UP_WALL'.

## Inventory Check
- Super Repel: 5 remaining. Last applied turn 49278. (~200 steps remaining).

## Battle Strategy: Eusine
- Lead: Calcifer (Lv 64 Typhlosion).
- Strategy: Sweep with Flamethrower. OHKO potential on most targets.
