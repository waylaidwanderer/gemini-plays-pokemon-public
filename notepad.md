## I. Game Mechanics & Systems

### Tile Traversal Rules
*   **WALL:** Impassable. Forms the boundaries of maps.
*   **FLOOR:** Standard traversable tile.
*   **LADDER:** A warp tile. Moves player between floors.
*   **WARP_PANEL:** A warp tile. Teleports the player to another location on the same floor.
*   **DOOR:** A warp tile. Leads to other buildings/areas.
*   **GRASS/TALL_GRASS:** Traversable. Can trigger wild Pokémon encounters.
*   **WATER/SEA:** Traversable only with the HM move SURF. Can trigger wild Pokémon encounters.
*   **BUOY:** Impassable obstacle in water.
*   **WHIRLPOOL:** Impassable obstacle in water. Likely requires a specific HM.
*   **TREE:** Small trees can be bypassed with the HM move CUT. Cut trees become impassable stumps.
*   **BOULDER:** Can be moved with the HM move STRENGTH.
*   **LEDGE:** One-way traversal. Can be jumped down but not climbed up.

### Key Items & HM Usage
*   **SQUIRTBOTTLE:** Used to wake up the Sudowoodo blocking Route 36.
*   **HM01 (CUT):** Cuts small trees. Learned by Feraligatr.
*   **HM02 (FLY):** Allows fast travel to previously visited cities. Needs Storm Badge to use.
*   **HM03 (SURF):** Allows travel over water. Needs Fog Badge to use. Learned by Feraligatr.
*   **HM04 (STRENGTH):** Moves large boulders. Needs Plain Badge to use. Learned by Feraligatr.
*   **HM05 (FLASH):** Illuminates dark caves. Needs Zephyr Badge to use.
*   **DIG:** Can be used to escape caves and some buildings, returning to the entrance.

### Other Mechanics
*   **Everstone:** A Pokémon holding this item will not evolve.
*   **Phone Calls:** NPCs can call to offer hints, battle rematches, or flavor text.
*   **Happiness:** Increased by haircuts and using items on Pokémon. Required for some evolutions (like Togepi).
*   **Day/Night Cycle:** Affects which Pokémon appear.
*   **Bug-Catching Contest:** Held on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays in the National Park.

## II. Puzzles & Solutions
*   **Sprout Tower:** Central pillar blocks direct ascent. Must go up the side ladders to the 3rd floor, then descend via the central ladder to reach the Elder.
*   **Azalea Gym:** A spiderweb platform puzzle. Switches reconfigure the platforms. The correct sequence is left switch, then right switch.
*   **Ilex Forest Farfetch'd:** Chase the Farfetch'd by stepping on twigs to make it turn. Corner it to return it to its owner.
*   **Goldenrod Gym:** A maze with trainers that appear and disappear. The path is a spiral shape resembling a Clefairy.
*   **Ecruteak Gym:** An invisible path puzzle. Many tiles are pitfalls that return you to the entrance. Requires careful trial and error to find the safe path to the Gym Leader.
*   **Cianwood Gym:** Defeated trainers become obstacles. A switch resets the puzzle. A boulder must be pushed with STRENGTH to clear the path.
*   **Team Rocket Hideout (B1F):** Features an invisible floor maze with traps that trigger battles. Security cameras also trigger battles if you walk in front of them. Arrow tiles can be disabled with a switch.

## III. Important NPCs & Quests
*   **Professor Elm:** Gave me my starter and the Pokémon Egg. Main quest giver.
*   **Rival (SILVA):** My recurring rival. Stole a Pokémon from Prof. Elm.
*   **Kurt (Azalea Town):** Makes special Poké Balls from Apricorns. Key to the Slowpoke Well quest.
*   **Day-Care Man (Route 34):** Gave me the ODD EGG.
*   **Sick Miltank (Route 39):** Needs 'lots of BERRIES' to get better.
*   **Sick Ampharos (Olivine Lighthouse):** Needs SECRETMEDICINE from Cianwood City. Curing it is required for Jasmine to return to her gym.
*   **Lance (Lake of Rage/Mahogany):** Helps to stop Team Rocket's radio signal plot.
*   **Team Rocket Passwords:** 'SLOWPOKETAIL' and 'RATICATE TAIL' are needed for the boss's door in the Mahogany hideout.
*   **Team Rocket Hideout (B1F):** An invisible floor maze with traps. Security cameras also trigger battles. The warp panel at (5, 15) connects the western and eastern sections of the floor.
