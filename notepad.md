### Current Status
- **Location**: Flower Shop (Goldenrod City).
- **Badge**: Plain Badge (Obtained).
- **Key Items**: Radio Card, Bicycle, Coin Case, Plain Badge.

### Objectives
1. Get SquirtBottle.
2. Go to Route 34 (Daycare).
3. Defeat Sudowoodo (Route 36).

### Tile Mechanics
- TYPE_3fe2: Floor (Walkable)
- TYPE_63e2: Wall/Planter (Blocked)
- TYPE_ffbb: Warp/Door (Walkable)
- TYPE_989e: Door Mat (Likely Blocked/Collision)
- Strategy: Interact with Sudowoodo on Route 36 to 'activate' the need for the SquirtBottle, then return to Goldenrod Flower Shop.
- Issue: Route 35 Gatehouse (Map 11_8) appears blocked by a guard and a solid door mat.
- Plan: Check West side of Goldenrod for alternative exits (near Radio Tower). If none, return to Gatehouse and troubleshoot (use tools).
