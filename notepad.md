# Correction: East Gap is Blocked (Turn 18214)
- **Observation:** Row 20 (Cols 27-29) is blocked by Buoys. The "East Gap" at (28, 23) cannot be reached from the North.
- **Conclusion:** Whirlpool usage is MANDATORY.
- **Path Selection:**
  - **West Whirlpool (15, 23):** Leads to West Channel. Lands at (14, 30) which connects to Shrine. **CHOSEN PATH.**
  - **East Whirlpool (24, 23):** Leads to uncertain connection at Row 30.
- **Plan:**
  1. Clear "Used Surf" text.
  2. Surf West to (15, 22).
  3. Use Whirlpool on (15, 23).
  4. Surf South to (13, 30).
  5. Land at (14, 30) and walk to Shrine.
