# Ilex Forest Strategy: Catching Farfetch'd

## Goal: Catch the runaway Farfetch'd to obtain HM01 (Cut).

## Farfetch'd Catch Mechanic (Hypothesis)
- **Catch Condition**: Interact with the bird from the tile directly behind it (opposite its facing direction).
- **Startle Condition**: Interacting from the front or side causes it to fly away.
- **Flight Path**: Flies ~4-5 tiles in the direction it is facing when startled.

## Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR**: Traversable.
- **WALL / DENSE_TREES**: Impassable.
- **HEADBUTT_TREE**: Impassable (Verified at 28, 24).
- **CUT_TREE**: Impassable. Requires HM01 Cut to clear.
- **LEDGE_HOP**: One-way traversal in the direction of the arrow.

## Key Locations
- **Apprentice**: (7, 28). Return here after catching bird.
- **Charcoal Kiln**: Azalea Town (21, 13). Boss gives Cut after quest.

## Party Status
- **Calcifer (QUILAVA) Lv22**: Lead.
- Team: ONIX, GEODUDE, PIDGEY, TOGEPI, EKANS.
