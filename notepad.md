- Goal: Complete the overworld sighting sequence to trigger the final battle at Tin Tower.
- Status: 16 Badges obtained. Clear Bell in possession.

## Suicune Chase Sequence (Crystal)
1. Burned Tower (Completed)
2. Cianwood City (North Beach plateau at (14, 10)) <- CURRENT TARGET
3. Route 42 (Mt. Mortar entrance)
4. Kanto Route 14 (Near Fuchsia City)
5. Route 25 (Cerulean Cape, near Bill's house)
6. Tin Tower 1F (Final Battle)

## Plan for Cianwood (Step 2)
- Hypothesis: Reach the West Beach (X=0-2) and walk North to Row 12, then East to Suicune.
- Hypothesis 2: Surf from Row 30 East, loop around the southern buoys in Route 41, then enter Cianwood's West side.
- Obstacle: (15, 37) and (9, 31) are DOORS. Avoid during pathfinding to prevent accidental warps.
- Action: Verify reachability of North Plateau via West Beach.
