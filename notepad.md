# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
## Strategy: Great Eastern Surf Loop
Reach the northern plateau (14, 10) by bypassing all land ledges via the Eastern Sea (X=28). Swim to Row 51, land, and use the Western Corridor (X=0-2) to reach Row 12. This avoids the central maze of one-way ledges.

## Execution Plan
1. Move to (27, 44) via (17, 42) and (18, 44) gap.
2. Move to (27, 43) and Surf into the Eastern Sea at (28, 43).
3. Move South to (28, 51) and land at (27, 51).
4. Walk West to (2, 51).
5. Walk North along Western Corridor (X=2) to Row 12.
6. Walk East to (14, 12) and North to (14, 10).
