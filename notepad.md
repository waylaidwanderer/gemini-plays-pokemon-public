## Tile Mechanics
### Route 32
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way North only. Blocks southward movement at y=6, 14, 24, 26, 34, 36, 72, 76, 86.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way South only. Found at (12, 27), (16, 15), (6, 81), (8, 81).
- LEDGE_HOP_RIGHT: One-way East only. Found at (17, 12), (17, 13), (17, 14), (9, 80).
- HEADBUTT_TREE: Impassable.

### Route 35
- FENCE/WALL: Impassable. Divides the route into west and east sections.
- WATER: Requires SURF to cross.

## Lessons Learned & Corrections
- **Type Matchups:** Ghost is immune to Normal/Fighting. Lick (Ghost) is ineffective against Normal. Hoppip is Grass/Flying and is NOT immune to Ghost moves (confused with Hoothoot).
- **Menu Navigation:** Start, Party, and Battle menus wrap. Always verify cursor position.
- **Tool Hygiene:** Refine custom tools immediately if they produce incorrect results.
