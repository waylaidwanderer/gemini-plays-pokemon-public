# Tile Mechanics (Global Reference)
- FLOOR: Walkable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Requires Surf.
- WATERFALL: Requires HM07 Waterfall. Facing Up/North at the base of the waterfall (e.g., (10, 30)) and pressing A triggers the climb. (Note: Menu usage may fail; interaction requires being directly adjacent and facing the waterfall tile). (Verified Turn #43564).
- TALL_GRASS: Wild encounters.
- DOOR/WARP: Map transitions.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks North/South movement. (Verified Turn #43532, #43576).
- LEDGE_HOP: One-way movement.
