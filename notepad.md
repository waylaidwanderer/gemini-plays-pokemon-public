# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Deposit a Pokemon to receive Dratini.

# Current Status (Turn 18371)
- **Location:** Dragon's Den 1F (5, 15).
- **Action:** Move to Ladder at (5, 13).
- **Reasoning:** 
    - The Warp Carpet at (5, 15) appears to be non-functional (likely an arrival point only).
    - I am likely on an isolated ledge.
    - The only way out is to go back down to B1F and use the Main Entrance Ladder at B1F (3, 3).
- **Goal:** Return to B1F, then navigate to Main Exit.

# Plan
1. Move to (5, 13) (Ladder).
2. Take Ladder to B1F (20, 3).
3. Surf West to Main Channel.
4. Navigate to Main Ladder at B1F (3, 3).
5. Exit to Blackthorn City.
