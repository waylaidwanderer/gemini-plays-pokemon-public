# Suicune Quest Strategy (Crystal Version)
- **Status:** Possession of Clear Bell confirmed. All 4 overworld sightings complete.
- **Current State:** Sage in Gatehouse (4_1) says "The TIN TOWER shook! A POKéMON must have returned to the top!"
- **Observation:** Wise Trio Room (4_2) is empty. Sages named Gaku, Masa, and Koji are present on Tin Tower 1F (3_4) but only provide lore.
- **Problem:** The center of Tin Tower 1F is blocked by statues/walls, and Suicune is not visible.
- **Objective:** Trigger the Suicune encounter on Tin Tower 1F.

## Strategy & Hypotheses
- **Hypothesis 1:** The Wise Trio battle on 1F (3_4) is triggered by talking to the Sages in a specific order or after a specific event.
- **Hypothesis 2:** There is an NPC in Ecruteak City or the Gatehouse that needs to be spoken to again to "activate" the 1F Sages for battle.
- **Plan:**
  1. Return to Tin Tower 1F (3_4).
  2. Talk to Gaku (11, 11), Masa (14, 6), and Koji (5, 9) in sequence.
  3. Attempt to walk into the center area (10, 8) after each interaction.
