# Suicune Quest (Crystal)
- Current Step: Route 36 sighting.
- Requirements: Sighting occurs at the junction of Route 36 and 37 (near the former Sudowoodo spot).
- Hypothesis 1: Approach from the West (Route 36) to trigger sighting (Failed twice).
- Hypothesis 2: Approach from the North (Route 37) to trigger sighting (Pending).
- Battle Plan (Tin Tower): Lead with XENON (Gastly). Turn 1: Hypnosis. Turn 2+: Night Shade.

# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL / HEADBUTT_TREE / FRUIT_TREE / COUNTER: Impassable.
- TALL_GRASS / LONG_GRASS: Traversable, triggers wild encounters.
- WATER: Impassable without Surf.
- LEDGE_HOP / LEDGE: One-way movement (usually South).
- WARP / DOOR / WARP_CARPET: Map transition.
- CUT_TREE: Impassable until Cut is used.

# PC Storage (Box 1)
- VORTEX (Poliwag 22), INTERCEPT (Yanma 12), ROCKY (Onix 6), EGG (Cleffa 5), XFDW (Meowth 16), FRITTATA (Togepi 5), SHUCKIE (Shuckle 15), Blarney (Sudowoodo 20).

# Key Observations
- Suicune Sighting Sequence: Burned Tower -> Cianwood -> Route 42 -> Route 36 -> Tin Tower.
- Route 37 "WEIRD_TREE" objects at (6, 12) and (7, 12) are the Twins Ann & Anne, not Suicune.
- Sage Permission Logic: Permission in 4_1 flags Route 42 completion.
- Navigation: Building 4_1 is a mandatory passage to Tin Tower backyard.

# Items Received
- Fire Stone: From Schoolboy Alan on Route 36. Collected at (31, 14).

# Lessons Learned
## Menu Navigation
- Use 1-2 button presses at a time and verify screen state in complex menus (FLY map, Pokedex).
- Verify "Currently selected" text before committing to navigation tools.

## Suicune Trigger Mechanics
- Pokedex 'Area' tracks the current active overworld sighting location.
