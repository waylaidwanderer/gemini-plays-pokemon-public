# I. Game Mechanics & Discoveries

## A. Verified Tile Mechanics
- **Ground:** Standard walkable tile.
- **Impassable:** Walls, objects, etc. Cannot be entered.
- **Grass:** Tall grass for wild Pokémon encounters.
- **Ledge:** Can be jumped down (one-way). Moving down into a ledge tile moves the player two tiles down.
- **Cuttable Tree:** Requires HM Cut to pass. Becomes `ground` after cutting, but respawns on map change.
- **Water:** Requires HM Surf to traverse. To use Surf from a land tile, you must be standing on a 'ground', 'water', or 'steps' tile adjacent to water, face the water, and use the HM from the party menu.
- **Boulder:** Requires HM Strength to move.
- **Hole:** Warps player to a lower floor.
- **Ladder (Up/Down):** Warps player between floors.
- **Warp:** An instant transition point between maps or areas within a map.
- **Steps:** Allows vertical and horizontal movement between 'steps' and adjacent 'ground' or 'elevated_ground' tiles.
- **Spinner (up, down, left, right):** Forces movement in a specific direction.
- **Spinner Stop:** A tile that halts movement from a spinner.
- **Elevated Ground:** Walkable ground at a different elevation. Movement between `elevated_ground` and `ground` is only possible via `steps`.
- **Gate (`gate_offscreen`, `closed_gate`, `open_gate`):** Barriers that may open or close based on game events. `gate_offscreen` is treated as open for pathfinding.

## B. General Heuristics & Rules
- **PC Interaction:** To use a PC, stand on the tile directly below it, face up, and press 'A'.
- **HM Usage:** HMs are used from the party menu outside of battle. Fainted Pokémon can use field moves.
- **"No Will to Fight" Message (Correction):** This message appears only when the cursor in the party menu is on an already fainted Pokémon. It is a UI error, not a gameplay mechanic.

# III. Tool Development & Usage

## A. Custom Tools & Agents
- My agents (`battle_strategist_agent`, etc.) are for high-level reasoning.
- My tools (`pathfinder`, etc.) are for complex computational tasks.
- **Tool Development:** My `pathfinder` tool has been updated to correctly handle impassable targets. It still cannot account for scripted barriers like the strong current, so manual exploration is sometimes needed.
- **Agent Usage Reminder:** I must use my `menu_navigator_agent` for all complex menu tasks to avoid manual errors.

# IV. Tool Development & Usage

## A. Custom Tools & Agents
- My agents (`battle_strategist_agent`, etc.) are for high-level reasoning.
- My tools (`pathfinder`, etc.) are for complex computational tasks.
- **Tool Maintenance is Priority #1:** If a core tool like `pathfinder` is broken, I MUST stop all other actions and fix it immediately using `define_tool`. Deferring fixes is a critical failure.
- **Agent Refinement:** If an agent provides a suboptimal response, it must be refined immediately.

## B. Agent & Tool Log
- `pathfinder`: Fixed a bug preventing it from finding paths to adjacent tiles of impassable targets. Fixed a `TypeError` in the `has_hm` function.
- `menu_navigator_agent`: Refined the system prompt to handle ambiguous menu text layouts correctly.

# V. Reflection & Meta-Strategy
- **Lesson from Pathfinder Failure:** Tool maintenance is my absolute highest priority. If a core tool like `pathfinder` is broken, I MUST stop all other actions and fix it immediately using `define_tool`. Deferring fixes is a critical failure.
- **Lesson from Menu Navigator Failure:** Agent refinement is just as critical as tool maintenance. An agent providing incorrect advice must be fixed immediately before proceeding. I must always test a fix by re-running the agent with the same inputs.
