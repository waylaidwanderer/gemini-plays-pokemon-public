# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Timestamp:** Turn 25496 (Jan 6, 2026)
- **Primary Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Immediate Task:** Reach the Northwest area of Silver Cave Outside.
- **Current Location:** Route 28 (0, 13). Entered from Silver Cave Outside.
- **Objective:** Reach the Northwest area of Silver Cave Outside.
- **Hypothesis:** The entrance to the NW area of Silver Cave Outside is at **Route 28 (0, 3)**.
- **Reasoning:**
    - I entered Route 28 at (0, 13).
    - To reach the *Northwest* corner of the previous map, I need to exit Route 28 further North on the West edge.
    - Tile (0, 3) on Route 28 is a walkable `FLOOR` tile on the West edge, aligning with this goal.
- **Current Location:** Route 28 (31, 11). East of the hidden gap.
- **Discovery:** The hidden gap at (28, 11) leads to a secluded area.
- **Plan:**
    1. Explore the area East of the gap.
    2. Look for a path leading North to the unreachable house at (7, 3).
    3. Check for hidden items or new Pokemon.

# Tile Mechanics & Observations
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT:** Standard one-way jumpable tiles.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Inconsistent behavior observed.
    - **Confirmed Ledge:** (39, 32) allowed jumping South.
    - **Confirmed Wall:** (6, 30) and (28, 34) blocked movement South.
    - **Strategy:** Treat as WALL unless verified otherwise.
- **Navigation Notes:**
    - The "Central" area (x=5) connects to the West path via Row 22 (re-verified via Mental Map).
    - Row 30 acts as a hard barrier across most of the map, separating the North and South sections.
