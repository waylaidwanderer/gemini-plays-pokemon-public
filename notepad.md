- WALL: Impassable ground/object.
- WATER: Surf required. Traversable.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.

# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The Inner Channel Master Path (Verified)
- Plan:
  1. Walk to (13, 16) via Row 33 and Column 12. [IN PROGRESS]
  2. Surf at (13, 16) to enter water at (14, 16).
  3. Navigate East to (23, 16), then North to (23, 14).
  4. Navigate West to (15, 14) and land at (14, 14).
  5. Walk North to (14, 10).
- Status: At (6, 33), heading to the Surf point.
- Reasoning: Direct land access to the plateau is blocked by rocks and ledges. The inner water channel provides a clear path around the city obstacles.
