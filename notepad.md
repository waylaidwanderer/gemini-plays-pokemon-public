# Long Term Notes
## Lessons Learned
- **Tool Insight:** `navigate_menu` is unreliable for small adjustments (overshoots). Use `press_buttons` for precision.
- **Menu Safety:** Always verify cursor position before confirming.
- **Efficiency:** Super Repels > Max Repels.
- **Interruptions:** Check screen text after phone calls.
- **Tool Safety:** Verify start coordinates before blind movement.

## Self-Reflection (Turn 31670)
1. **Execution:** Deferring tool fixes caused menu loops. Switching to manual `press_buttons` NOW.
2. **Notepad:** Good. Keeping "Transaction State" for immediate tracking.
3. **Map:** Markers are accurate.
4. **Automation:** `navigate_menu` is failing. Abandoning it for this menu.
5. **Goals:** Clear.
6. **Errors:** Overshooting due to tool lag/repetition. Fix: Single-step or raw button presses.
