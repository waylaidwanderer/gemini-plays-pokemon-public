# Reflection (Turn 11588)
- **Execution:** No deferred tasks. Addressed PC confusion immediately.
- **Hygiene:** Notepad is up to date. Map markers are good.
- **Automation:** Tools are functioning, though `navigate_to_coords` had a pathfinding issue earlier (likely distance/door related).
- **Goals:** Clear.
- **Errors:** Menu navigation failed (ended in Pack). Lesson: Assume menu cursor memory or verify state before long sequences.
- **Quest Info:** No Rocket Uniform needed. Just force/battle through.
- **Locked Door:** Underground (18, 6) needs a key. Remember this for later.
