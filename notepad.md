# Current Strategy: Return to Red
- **Timestamp:** Turn 26380 (Jan 7, 2026) [Silver Cave Room 2]
- **Status:** Surfing at (7, 26).
- **Immediate Goal:** Re-verify West Landing (5, 21).
- **Plan:**
  1. Surf to (5, 22).
  2. Step onto land at (5, 21).
  3. Bump walls at (5, 20), (4, 20), (6, 20) to check for hidden paths.
  4. If nothing, proceed to Central Island (11, 25).

# Investigation List
- **West Landing (5, 21):** Previously marked empty. Checking for hidden items/caves.

- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** South-facing Ledge. Blocks North movement.
