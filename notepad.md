## Active Quest: Find Granddaughter [Started Turn 37715]
- Clues: Granddaughter is missing; sailor (ID 2) on B1F is looking for his buddy; buddy is "goofing off".
- Progress: Met sailor (ID 2) on B1F. He blocks the path north and asks for his buddy.
- Strategy: Search all cabins on 1F and the kitchen (B1F) to find the buddy.
- Hypothesis: Finding the buddy triggers the B1F sailor to move. The granddaughter is likely with the Captain.
- Quest started: Turn 37715 (Timestamp: Friday, Jan 9, 2026, 6:00 PM).

## Kanto Strategy
- Goal: Collect 8 Kanto badges.
- Target 1: Lt. Surge (Vermilion City).
- MVP: GNEISS (Graveler) Lv 51. Ground-type immunity to Electric.

## Lessons Learned
- S.S. Aqua sailors block corridors; they "shadow" movements if not triggered to move.
- Super Nerd (26, 9) blocks the x=26 corridor on B1F.
- Map transitions reset NPC positions.
- Path to western 1F is likely via B1F (East 1F -> East B1F -> West B1F -> West 1F).
