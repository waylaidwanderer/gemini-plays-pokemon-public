# Suicune Quest
- Objective: Trigger sighting in Cianwood City at northern shore.
- Strategy: The Sea Loop (Surfing Route)
    1. Surf at (19, 30).
    2. Go North to Row 16.
    3. Go East to X=27.
    4. Go North to Row 4 (past the buoy walls at X=26 and Row 9).
    5. Go West along Row 4 to (7, 4) area.
- Note: This avoids the long land route and the wall at (19, 40).
- Suicune sighting count = 1.

# Tile Mechanics (Cianwood)
- FLOOR: Standard walkable ground.
- WATER: Traversable only while Surfing.
- WALL / FLOOR_UP_WALL / LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: All act as IMPASSABLE obstacles from the north.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- Interaction: Surf from FLOOR adjacent to WATER by pressing A.

# Confirmed Corridors
- X=19: Clear from Row 30 to Row 51.
- Row 51: Clear from X=4 to X=23.
- X=4: Clear from Row 44 to Row 51.
- Row 44: Clear from X=2 to X=23.
- X=2: Clear from Row 4 to Row 49.

# Lessons Learned
- Cianwood ledges are impassable from the north. Do not attempt to jump them.
- Internal walls divide the city into vertical strips; use Row 51 to move between them.
- Always reveal tiles manually before planning long-distance routes.
