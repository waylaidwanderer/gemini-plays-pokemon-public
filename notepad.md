# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- **Quest Start:** Turn 48900
- **Status:** Executing Western Corridor path via Row 50 gap at X=11.

## Execution Plan (Western Corridor)
1. Walk to (13, 16) and Surf south to (14, 30) landing. <- CURRENT TASK
2. Walk to (12, 49), then West to (11, 49).
3. Walk South through gap at (11, 50) to (11, 51).
4. Walk West to (2, 51), then North to (2, 10).
5. Walk East to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

## Strategy: Southern Bypass
The city center is blocked by one-way ledges (Row 34, 46, 48, 50) and walls. To reach the western corridor (X=2), I must Surf around the south end of the map (Row 51). This avoids all city barriers.

## Failed Hypotheses & Lessons
- Island Hop (13, 16) via (11, 15): Dead end alcove at (11, 14).
- Inner Channel (X=12): Blocked at Row 15 by buoy wall.
- Terrestrial Path (South): Blocked by multiple ledge lines.
- Terrestrial Path (West): Blocked by wall lines at X=11, 9, 5, 3.

## Progress Summary
- All 16 Badges obtained.
- Elite Four/Red defeated.
- Current Focus: Suicune tracking.
