# I. Core Directives & Lessons Learned
- **IMMEDIATE DATA & TOOL MAINTENANCE (CRITICAL):** As an LLM, my thinking is not continuous. All maintenance tasks (tool creation/fixing, agent definition, notepad updates) are the absolute highest priority and **MUST** be performed successfully in the current turn. Deferring tasks is an invalid strategy.
- **TRUST YOUR TOOLS & AGENTS (CRITICAL):** I must trust my tool and agent outputs as the default assumption. Before debugging, I must first verify my own position and assumptions against the game state.
- **VERIFY POSITION (CRITICAL):** I have a history of position hallucinations. I **MUST** check my position in the Game State Information at the start of every turn before forming a plan.
- **MAP MARKER DISCIPLINE (CRITICAL):** I must mark every warp tile (both entry and exit) with '🚪' and every defeated trainer with '☠️' immediately.
- **HYPOTHESIS VETTING (CRITICAL):** Before attempting to test a hypothesis, I must first confirm it is mechanically possible within the game's established rules.
- **Agent Escalation Protocol (MUST FOLLOW):** If manual puzzle attempts fail repeatedly or direct navigation is impossible in a complex area, I MUST escalate to my specialized agents (`sequence_puzzle_solver`, `multi_stage_navigator`) before continuing with manual attempts.

# II. Game Mechanics & Tile Types (Observed)
- **Post-Battle Position Shift:** Player may be moved after a wild battle.
- **Ghost-type Damage:** Ghost-type moves deal SPECIAL damage.
- **Purified Zone:** A healing area in Pokémon Tower (5F).
- **Inventory Access Bug (Confirmed):** With 21+ unique item stacks, 'ITEM' from the Start Menu opens the HM pocket.
- **Celadon City Fly Anomaly:** Using HM Fly from anywhere within Celadon City teleports the player to the Celadon Department Store entrance.
- **Fee Trigger Tile:** A tile that prompts for an entrance fee, even if already inside. Paying a second time broke a scripted loop.
- **Fossil Trap:** Interacting with the fossil exhibits in the Pewter Museum of Science can trigger a trap that temporarily places the player on an impassable tile. This trap can be escaped by pressing the 'B' button.
- **Hidden Paths (Confirmed):** Some tiles that appear as impassable walls (e.g., `elevated_ground` at Mt. Moon B2F, 22, 17) can be walked through, creating hidden passages.

### Tile Traversal Rules (Comprehensive)
- `ground` / `grass`: Standard walkable tiles.
- `impassable`: Walls, objects, NPCs, etc. Cannot be entered.
- `ledge`: One-way traversal. Can be jumped down from above (Y-1).
- `cuttable`: Tree that can be cut with HM Cut. Respawns on map change.
- `water`: Crossable using HM Surf.
- `spinner_*`: Forces movement. The `automated_path_navigator` can model paths that utilize these tiles.
- `spinner_stop`: A tile that halts movement from a spinner.
- `teleport` / `hole` / `ladder_*`: Instant warp tiles.
- `2x1/1x2 Warp Tiles`: Requires a two-step activation (stand on tile, press into boundary).
- `Two-Step Elevator`: Special warp (interact with panel, step onto adjacent warp).
- `steps`: Allows movement between `ground` and `elevated_ground`.
- `boulder_barrier` / `boulder_switch`: Switch that clears a barrier when a boulder is pushed onto it.
- `gate_*`: Gates that can block paths.

# IV. Key NPCs & Blockers
- **Mt. Moon Rocket Grunt (B2F, 30, 12):** Confirmed he requires an unrevived fossil to pass. Dialogue: "If you find a fossil, give it to me and scram!"
- **Mt. Moon Hiker (1F, 6, 7):** Blocks path with dialogue "Kids like you shouldn't be here!". **Hypothesis:** His state may change after further progress. **Next Step:** Re-check after current exploration paths are exhausted.

# V. Agent & Tool Development Ideas
- **Lost Item Investigator Agent:** An agent that takes an objective (e.g., 'Find TM28') and a list of clues, then proposes a ranked sequence of locations to search and actions to perform.
- **Path Failure Analyst Agent:** Analyzes failed `automated_path_navigator` output and suggests manual probe coordinates based on known hidden path mechanics.
- **Wall Prober Tool:** A tool to automate systematic probing of walls for hidden passages.

# VI. Current Investigation: Unrevived Fossil
- **Objective:** Obtain an unrevived fossil to give to the Rocket Grunt on Mt. Moon B2F.
- **Current Location:** Mt. Moon B2F.
- **Strategy:** My `multi_stage_navigator` agent has proven unreliable for this maze. I will now proceed with manual, systematic exploration, using my `automated_path_navigator` tool for intra-floor movement. My immediate goal is to return to B2F and find a path to the other reachable warp at (6, 8).

# VII. Self-Assessment & Overwatch Critique Takeaways (Turn 231171 & 231325)
- **CRITICAL - Tool Maintenance:** My highest priority is immediate tool maintenance. I failed by deferring a fix for the `automated_path_navigator` and by not consolidating battle tools. Faulty or inefficient tools **MUST** be fixed/improved in the same turn they are identified. (Consolidated `select_battle_action` in T231310).
- **Notepad Organization:** Long, archived sections should be condensed to improve readability. (Condensed Pewter Museum puzzle and other archived investigations in T231325).

# VIII. Archived Investigations
### Mt. Moon Fossil Search (Manual Exploration Phase)
- **Summary:** Initial manual exploration of Mt. Moon 1F and parts of B1F/B2F yielded no fossils. Key findings included the Cinnabar Lab info from a Super Nerd and a path blocked by a Hiker. This inefficient phase prompted a switch to a systematic, data-gathering strategy.
### TM28 (DIG) - Cerulean Backyard
- **Summary:** Used ITEMFINDER and visual inspection at (30, 10) and (31, 10) in the Cerulean Backyard after defeating a Rocket Grunt. No item was found. Investigation concluded.
### Old Amber Retrieval (Pewter Museum)
- **Summary:** Solved via a complex, multi-step sequence involving NPC and exhibit interactions across both floors of the Pewter Museum.
- **Key Lesson:** Puzzles in this hack can require non-obvious sequences of interactions that are not hinted at directly. The solution involved speaking to an Old Man with a specific Pokémon (Geodude), interacting with an unrelated exhibit (space shuttle), and then interacting with a fossil exhibit. This highlights the need for creative, systematic hypothesis testing, and confirms the value of the `sequence_puzzle_solver` agent for future complex puzzles.
### Overwatch Critique Takeaways (Turn 231500)
- **Agent Escalation:** I failed to follow my own protocol and use the `multi_stage_navigator` in a complex maze, wasting over 100 turns on inefficient manual exploration. I MUST trust my protocols and escalate to agents sooner.
- **Marker Accuracy:** My marker labels have been repeatedly inaccurate, forcing me to waste turns on corrections. I MUST be more diligent and double-check warp destinations immediately after using them to ensure labels are correct from the start.

# IX. Mt. Moon Map Data (Archived)
- Raw map data has been moved out of the notepad for readability, as per Overwatch critique.
- Use the `map_data_analyzer` tool for future analysis of this data.
