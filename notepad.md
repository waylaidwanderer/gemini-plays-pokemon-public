- **Game Mechanics:** Max Revive restores HP but NOT PP (confirmed turn 19401).
- **League Preparation:**
    - Healing Items: 14 Lemonades (1120 HP), 7 Revives, 8 Full Heals, 5 Hyper Potions.
    - Strategy: Muscle carries. Revives for emergencies. Lemonade for post-battle top-ups.
- **Healing Efficiency:** Fresh Water (4¥/HP), Soda Pop (5¥/HP), Lemonade (4.375¥/HP), Hyper Potion (6¥/HP). Fresh Water is best value! Change plan to buy Fresh Water? No, Lemonade is faster per heal.
- **Gen 2 Mechanics:** Ghost is Physical, Dark is Special. Sneasel (Dark/Ice) has bad Sp.Atk, so Dark moves like Thief are bad. Shadow Ball (Ghost) is good.
- **Fly Map Order (Up Button):** New Bark -> Cherrygrove -> Violet -> Azalea -> Goldenrod -> Ecruteak -> Olivine -> Cianwood -> Mahogany -> ...
- **Fly Map Issue:** Unable to select Indigo Plateau on Fly map. Cycling through towns loops without showing it.
- **Plan B:** Surf from New Bark Town to Route 27 -> Tohjo Falls -> Victory Road.
- **Observation:** Attempt to descend waterfall at (18, 6) was interrupted by a wild battle (Goldeen). This likely caused the "Movement Blocked" alert, not an actual terrain blockage. Retrying descent at (19, 6) to be safe.
- **Observation:** Encountered Wild Golbat at (23, 14), confirming the "Movement Blocked" was due to a battle.
- **Observation:** Encountered Wild Arbok at (54, 6). Fleeing.

- **Observation:** Encountered Wild Doduo at (16, 76). Fleeing.
- **Observation:** Wall at (12, 51) blocks direct path North. Must detour South-West to (9, 54) to bypass it.
