# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH. Allows NORTH. Verified: Down at (24, 45) failed (Turn 49602).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH. Found at Row 15 (X=3-17).
- ROCK: Smashable rocks act as WALLs.
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
## Strategy: Western Bypass (Row 33/36)
Reach (14, 10) by bypassing ledges via the western corridor (X=2).
1. Move North through gap at (18, 46) to Row 44.
2. Move West along Row 44 to (12, 44).
3. Move North along X=12 to (12, 33).
4. Move West along Row 33 to (7, 33).
5. Move South to (7, 36) and West to (2, 36).
6. Walk North along X=2 to Row 12 (bypasses Row 15 ledge).
7. Walk East to (14, 12) and North to (14, 10).
- Current Step: Moving South to (7, 36) to bypass the X=5 wall.

# Progress Notes
- X=12 Corridor: Clear from Row 44 to Row 33.
- Row 33 Gap: (9, 33) allows passage West across X=9 wall.
- Row 36 Bypass: (6-5, 36) allows passage West across X=5 wall.
- X=2 Corridor: Clear from Row 36 to Row 12.
- Ledge (Row 15): Does not block X=2.
