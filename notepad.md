# Suicune Quest Strategy: 'The Row 0 Bypass'
- Fact: The northern plateau is walled off from the south. The gap at (11, 15) leads to a dead end pocket (11, 14). The buoy walls seem to end at Row 0.
- Route:
    1. Use SUPER REPEL. (Done)
    2. From (25, 10), sail to (27, 10) -> (27, 1).
    3. Scout Row 1-5 for gaps in X=26 wall.
    4. If no gaps, sail to (27, 0) -> (25, 0) and sail West along Row 0.
    5. Land at (14, 10) and walk to (7, 4).
- Preparation: Lead with XENON (Haunter) for Hypnosis.
