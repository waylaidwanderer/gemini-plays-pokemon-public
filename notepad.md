# Suicune Quest
- Objective: Trigger sighting in Cianwood City at northern shore.
- Verified Path: (12, 30) -> (12, 34) -> (10, 34) -> (10, 33) -> (8, 33) -> (8, 35) -> (2, 35) -> (2, 4) -> (7, 4).
- Note: All ledges in Cianwood are impassable from the north. Row 30, 33, 34, 35 are key crossing points.
- Suicune sighting count = 1.

# Tile Mechanics (Cianwood)
- FLOOR: Standard walkable ground.
- WATER: Traversable only while Surfing.
- WALL / FLOOR_UP_WALL / LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: All act as IMPASSABLE obstacles from the north.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- Interaction: Surf from FLOOR adjacent to WATER by pressing A.

# Confirmed Corridors
- Row 30: Clear from X=12 to X=20.
- Row 33: Clear from X=8 to X=17.
- Row 34: Clear from X=10 to X=19.
- Row 35: Clear from X=2 to X=8.
- X=2: Clear north-south thoroughfare on the far west coast.

# Lessons Learned
- Cianwood ledges are traps; do not attempt to jump them from the north.
- Always reveal tiles manually before planning long-distance routes.
- Internal walls divide the city into vertical strips; use verified horizontal "gaps" to move between them.
