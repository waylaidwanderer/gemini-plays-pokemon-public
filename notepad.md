# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Location:** Silver Cave Outside.
- **Status:** Searching for West Entrance.
- **Action:** Navigate South-East to (38, 34) (Gap in Wall).
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Tree at (31, 24) is cut.
  2. Proceed South through the opening to (31, 25).
  3. Navigate East/South via Col 32 (jumping ledges) to reach Row 32.
  4. Traverse East to Col 38.
  5. Go South through the gap at (38, 34) to access the Bottom Corridor (Row 35).
  6. From Row 35, traverse West to find the hidden entrance.
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Exited cave at (18, 11) (Main Entrance). 
  2. The internal West Corridor (Column 0) was inaccessible from the main area due to ledges. It likely connects to a hidden external entrance.
  3. Row 24 contains water. I will Surf West to search for land and a second cave entrance.
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.

# Tile Mechanics
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN:** One-way South.

- **CUT_TREE:** Obstacle unless Cut is used.
