# Ice Path Strategy
- **Current State:** At Ice Path B1F (7, 9).
- **Goal:** Clear the Boulder blockade at (x=7-9, y=8-10) to access the South Room.
- **Status:** STRENGTH Active. Text box open.
- **Puzzle Logic (Updated):**
  - **B3 Status:** Pushed to Pit (5, 12). (DONE)
  - **B2 Status:** At (5, 6).
  - **B1 Status:** At (11, 8). Appears stuck (Walls South/Left). Need to inspect.
  - **Plan (B2 & B1):**
    1. **Navigate:** Loop South (Row 11) -> East (Col 12) -> North to (12, 8).
    2. **Inspect B1:** Verify if (11, 9) or (10, 8) are actually walls.
    3. **Solve B2:** Continue North to Row 1 -> West to Col 6 -> South to (6, 6). Push B2 Left -> Down to Pit (4, 7).
    4. **Solve B1/B4:** Handle after B2.
- **Next Step:** Navigate to (12, 8) via South loop.
