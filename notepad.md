# Gem's Pokémon Crystal Adventure!

## Current Mission
- **Primary Objective:** Defeat the Violet City Gym Leader.

## Game Mechanics & Quirks
- **Headbutt Trees:** Some trees are 'HEADBUTT_TREE' type and are impassable.
- **Dialogue Triggers:** Some dialogues might loop until another specific NPC in the room is spoken to (e.g., Elm's Lab).
- **Wild Encounters:** Can be triggered on 'FLOOR' tiles if they are adjacent to 'TALL_GRASS' tiles. (Observed on Route 30).
- **One-Way Paths:** The gatehouse between Route 29 and Route 46 appears to be a one-way path.
- **Ledge Mechanics:** I can move sideways (left/right) along 'HOP_DOWN' tiles on Route 29.
- **Shifting Mazes:** Route 29 can have its layout change, but a stable path seems to have opened at Y=16.

## Agent Performance & Lessons
- **Trust Agents:** I must trust my agents' calculations over my own intuition.
- **Systematic Updates:** When a new game mechanic is discovered, ALL relevant agents must be updated immediately.
- **World Knowledge Graph:** I need to check the graph before adding new edges to avoid errors.

## World Knowledge & NPCs
- **New Bark Town:** A Fisher at (12, 9) mentioned Prof. Elm discovered new Pokémon. A Scientist in Elm's Lab gave me Poké Balls after the Pokémon theft was reported.
- **Professor Elm:** Tasked me with challenging the Pokémon Gyms, starting with Violet City.
- **Rival Silver:** Stole a Pokémon from Professor Elm's lab.
- **Route 29:** A Cooltrainer at (52, 9) offers a Pokémon catching tutorial. He explains that weakening a Pokémon makes it easier to catch.

## Unverified Assumptions & Hypotheses
- **Mom's Healing:** Can Mom heal my Pokémon?
- **Cherrygrove Mart:** Is the Poké Mart still inaccessible?
- **Cooltrainer Battle:** Does the Cooltrainer battle you after the tutorial?

## Completed Objectives & Past Events
- Delivered the MYSTERY EGG to Professor Elm.
- Named my rival 'Silver'.
- Navigated the shifting maze of Route 29.
- Spoke to Mom and arranged for her to save my money.

## Reflection Notes (Turn 1831)
- My documentation needs to be kept up-to-date. I'll make sure to move completed tasks to the correct section of my notepad.
- I will continue to use map markers proactively for important NPCs and locations.
