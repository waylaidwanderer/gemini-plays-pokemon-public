# Pokémon Crystal Journey

## Current Situation
- **Objective:** Begin the Pokémon Gym Challenge. The first gym is in Violet City.
- **Next Step:** Travel to Violet City.
- **Status:** On Route 30, heading north to battle trainers and continue towards Violet City.

## Party
- Hestia (Cyndaquil)
- Vermin (Rattata)
- Hedwig (Hoothoot)

## Long-term Goal
- Become the Pokémon League Champion.

## The Rival
- A red-haired boy named KAINE stole a Totodile from Professor Elm's lab.

## Key Items
- **POKéGEAR:** Received from Mom. Has a Phone feature. Mom is saving money for me.
- **POKéDEX:** Received from Professor Oak.
- **POKé BALLS:** Received from Elm's assistant. Used one to catch a Rattata.

## Mechanics & Discoveries
### System Mechanics
- **Stuck on Warp/Event Tile:** If movement is locked after a warp or event, opening the main menu ('Start') and then closing it ('EXIT' or 'B') can resolve the issue.

### Environmental Mechanics
- **Route 29 Ledges:** The western section of Route 29 has one-way ledges preventing eastward travel from that area.
- **Route 46:** This route is a dead-end when approached from the south due to one-way ledges.
- **CUT_TREE:** These small trees are impassable and require the HM 'Cut' to be removed.

### Battle Mechanics
- **Held Items (Berries):** Pokémon can use held Berries to heal themselves in battle.
- **Catching:** Weakening a Pokémon makes it easier to catch.

## Agent Ideas
- **battle_strategist_agent:** An agent that can analyze the current battle state (my Pokémon, opponent Pokémon, known moves, type matchups) and suggest the optimal move or action. This would be especially helpful for difficult battles like Gym Leaders.

## Pokémon Encounters
### Route 30
- **Ledyba (Lv. 3):** Bug/Flying type. Observed move: TACKLE.
- **Caterpie (Lv. 3):** Bug type. Observed move: TACKLE.
