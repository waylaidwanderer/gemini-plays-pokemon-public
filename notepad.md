# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Cross the whirlpool to reach the Dragon Shrine.

# Key Mechanics & Lessons
- **Field Moves:** If 'A' interaction fails (even when facing correctly), ALWAYS fallback to Menu -> Pokemon -> [Mon] -> [Move].
- **Whirlpool:** Requires facing the whirlpool tile directly. 'A' button might be unreliable; Menu is safer.

- Status: Opening Menu to use Whirlpool (Fallback Method).
- Reason: Direct 'A' interaction with the whirlpool at (15, 23) failed (no text response). This usually forces the Menu interaction method.
- Step 1: Press 'Start' to open Main Menu.
- Step 2: Navigate to POKEMON -> LAPIS -> WHIRLPOOL.
