# Location Notes
## Goldenrod City
- **Pokemon Center:** Found at (15, 27).
- **Flower Shop:** (29, 5). Needs Plain Badge for SquirtBottle (Have Badge!).
- **Gym:** Cleared. Plain Badge obtained.
- **Underground Entrance:** North side (9, 5).

# Key Items

# Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR:** Standard traversable terrain. No special effects.
- **WALL:** Impassable obstacle. Blocks movement.
- **WARP_CARPET_DOWN:** Traversable. Moving onto this tile triggers a warp to the connected map.
- **TOWN_MAP / WINDOW:** Acts as a wall.
- **Gym Layout:** The gym requires a counter-clockwise path (Bottom -> Right -> Top -> Left). The top corridor leads to a downward path on the far left (Column 0-2), guarded by a Beauty.
- **NPC Blocking:** Trainers often block paths after battling. Leaving and re-entering the map resets their position.
- **Mechanic (NPC Blocking):** Trainers defeated in battle often block the path until the map is reloaded (exit and re-enter).
- **Mechanic (Battle):** In Gen 2, Fire-type moves (Ember) are Special. Attack-lowering moves like Charm do not reduce their damage.
