## Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Traversable (requires SURF).
- WATERFALL: Impassable (requires WATERFALL).
- LEDGE (FLOOR_UP_WALL): One-way jump.
- COUNTER: Impassable; interactable from front.
- LADDER: Warp to another floor/map.
- WARP_CARPET_DOWN: Exit/warp to another map.
- PC: Impassable; interactable from front (up).
- ICE: Causes sliding in the direction of movement until an obstacle or non-ice tile is reached.

## Lessons Learned
- Rising Badge: Allows use of HM07 Waterfall outside battle.
- Tohjo Falls Ledges: Row 16 ledges are impassable from North.
- Navigation: If a movement fails twice, the tile is impassable from that direction.
- Item Discovery: Moon Stone found in Tohjo Falls at (2, 6).
- Time Tracking: Searched for HM07 in Tohjo Falls for ~90 turns before verifying location.
- Wild Encounters: Trigger battles and block movement on the turn they occur. (Turn 36162)

## Route 44 Navigation Notes
- Ledge Gap: A traversable gap in the east-west ledges exists at x=49 (row 8 to 14 is clear at this x-coordinate).
- NPC Obstacles:
  - Cooltrainer Cybil: (31, 14)
  - Cooltrainer Allen: (37, 15)
  - Bird Keeper Vance: (51, 6)
  - Youngster: (51, 5)
- Ice Path Entrance: (56, 7). Reachable from the north section of Route 44.
- North/South Section Divide: Route 44 is divided by a line of ledges in row 9 (x=51-57) and row 13 (x=50-53). Use the gap at x=49 to move between them.
