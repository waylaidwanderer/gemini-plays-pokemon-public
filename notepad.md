# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Current Objectives
1. **Find Floria**: Search for her on Route 36 near the Sudowoodo.
2. **Get SquirtBottle**: Return to Flower Shop (19, 1) after finding Floria.
3. **Clear Sudowoodo**: Use SquirtBottle on Route 36.

### Navigation Strategy: Goldenrod City
- **Route 35 Exit**: Accessed via the back door of the Flower Shop (19, 1). Warps to Map 10_2 (Alley/Route 35).
- **Map 10_2**: The area behind the buildings. Follow the path North to reach Route 36.
- **Connections**:
  - South: Warps back to Flower Shop (9, 33).
  - North: Leads to Route 36 (Floria's location).

### Validated Locations
- **Flower Shop**: (19, 1).
- **Underground Entrance**: (9, 5).
- **Radio Tower**: (5, 15).
- **Gym**: (24, 7).
- **Sticker Girl**: Route 36 (15, 24). Not Floria.

### Quest Log
- **Badges**: Zephyr, Hive, Plain.
- **Party**: Quilava (27), Bellsprout (6), Togepi (5), Rattata (8), Igglybuff (5).
- **West Narrow Path**: Explored (x=3, y=15). Dead end to the North.
- **Correction**: The East side and Center are dead ends. The Underground path leads South (wrong way).
- **Hypothesis**: The Train Tracks at the far West (x=0-1) might offer a path North.
- **West Side Access**: The path at x=8 is blocked at y=24 by a fence. A continuous vertical barrier (wall/ledge/fence) exists at x=9, separating East and West sides.
- **West Side Access**: The path at x=8 is blocked. The South area (Gatehouse) does not connect to the West side.
- **Correction**: The Northern path at y=2 is a dead end (blocked by trees at x=9).
- **Plan**: Head West from (27, 12) across the tall grass to reach the center of Route 36.
- **Tracks**: Possible path North along the tracks?
### Navigation Strategy: Route 36
- **Current Location**: Route 36 (North of Route 35).
- **Objective**: Reach the T-intersection.
  - **West**: National Park.
  - **East**: Violet City.
  - **Center**: Sudowoodo (Blocked).
- **Search Area**: Look for Floria near the Sudowoodo.
### Tile Mechanics
- **Walkable**: `TYPE_3fe2` (Grass), `TYPE_3f8d` (Tall Grass), `TYPE_fed7` (Path)
- **Obstacle**: `TYPE_2889` (Tree/Fence)

### Quest Progress
- **Find Floria**: Started ~Turn 10589.
- **Route 36 Layout**: Gatehouse is at South end (y=48). Main road appears to be North (y=20-30). I likely overshot South.
- **Plan**: Talk to Alan, then head North to find the East-West road and the Sudowoodo.
