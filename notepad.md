# Mechanics
- **Battle Cursor:** Remembers last move used.
- **Fly Map:** Visual Map (Cursor based). Use D-pad to select city. **Cursor persists:** Verify destination text.
- **Pokegear Map:** Visual. (Does NOT track Roamers in Crystal - Use Pokedex).
- **Menu Memory:** Start Menu and Pokegear cursors remember their last position. Always verify state.
- **Repel Safety:** Always re-apply Repel IMMEDIATELY upon expiration.
- **Tile Mechanics:**
    - **Route 38 Gatehouse (35,8) & (35,9):** "Sticky" warps. Moving into them requires a second input to trigger the warp.
    - **Traversal:** "Double Tap" direction (Right x2 to enter, Left x2 to exit) ensures successful transition.
