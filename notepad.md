# Reflection (Turn 28509)
- **Execution:** Caught Lugia with Master Ball after realizing Whirlwind risk. This averted a potential failure.
- **Hygiene:** Notepad is concise. Map markers for Lugia and warps were used and cleaned up correctly.
- **Lessons:** Always check movesets for high-level wild Pokemon to prevent fleeing/phasing (Whirlwind/Roar).
- **Automation:** `navigate_menu` is working but cursor position on Fly map needs careful verification.
- **Goals:** Pivoted from Catching to Healing/Roaming Beasts. Strategy remains solid.
