# Suicune Quest (Crystal) - FIXED SIGHTINGS
- Milestone 1: Burned Tower (Seen).
- Milestone 2: Cianwood City (Seen). Defeated Eusine.
- Milestone 3: Route 42 (In Progress). Pokedex shows Suicune here.
- Milestone 4: Route 36 (Next).
- Milestone 5: Tin Tower (Final). Requirement: Clear Bell (OBTAINED) + all sightings.

## Strategy for Route 42 Sighting:
- Priority 1: Explore the northern corridor (Row 3-4) and western pocket (Row 1-2). These are reachable via the eastern route path or Mt. Mortar.
- Priority 2: Re-check the middle island floor (X=24-30, Y=14-17) ONLY if Priority 1 fails.
- Approach: Surf East from (33, 10) to (40, 10) to access the eastern path.

# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Traversable with HM03 SURF.
- TALL_GRASS / LONG_GRASS: Traversable; triggers encounters.
- LEDGE: One-way traversable (usually South).
- WARP / DOOR / WARP_CARPET / CAVE: Map transition.
- FRUIT_TREE: Impassable; interact for fruit/apricorn.
- HEADBUTT_TREE: Impassable; interact with HM02 HEADBUTT to trigger encounters.
- CUT_TREE: Impassable until cleared with HM01 CUT.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way wall; jumpable from North to South.

# Failed Hypotheses
- Suicune Sighting (Route 42): Island center sweep (X=24-30, Y=14-17) failed to trigger sighting multiple times (Turns 17968, 17985, 18002).
- Hypothesis: Suicune is at the Apricorn trees (28, 16). Status: DENIED (Turn 17968).

# Discoveries
- Suicune is NOT at the Apricorn trees (28, 16) as of Turn 17968.
- Northern Corridor: Reachable from the eastern side of the route near Mt. Mortar entrance (46, 7).
- Western Pocket: Reachable from the western Mt. Mortar entrance (10, 5).
- Headbutt Trees: Located at (22, 13), (23, 13), (25, 13), (26, 13), (27, 13), (28, 13), (29, 13), (22, 14), (23, 14), (28, 14), (29, 14), (30, 14), (31, 14), (29, 12).

# PC Storage (Box 1)
- VORTEX (Poliwag 22), INTERCEPT (Yanma 12), ROCKY (Onix 6), EGG (CleFFA 5), XFDW (Meowth 16), FRITTATA (Togepi 5), SHUCKIE (Shuckle 15), Blarney (Sudowoodo 20).
