## Status & Progress

- **Lead:** GNEISS (Graveler) Lv44.
- **Moves:** Earthquake, Rollout.
- **Opponents:** Sages Gaku, Masa, and Koji on Tin Tower 1F.

## Navigation Plan
1. Travel to Route 42 (East of Ecruteak) and check the middle area for Suicune.
2. Travel to Route 36 (South of Ecruteak) and check for Suicune.
3. Once sightings are confirmed, return to Tin Tower 1F (3_4) to battle the Wise Trio.
4. Catch Suicune in the center of Tin Tower 1F.
- **Task Start:** Verify Route 42/36 sightings. Started Turn 27247, 4:23 PM.
- **Lesson Learned:** Sages providing lore does NOT mean they are defeated. Always trust the `suicune_tracker_v2` agent's 'missing_flags' output over personal assumptions.
## Tile Mechanics - Global
- **FLOOR**: Standard walkable tile.
- **WALL**: Impassable terrain.
- **COUNTER**: Impassable. Interact with NPCs behind them by facing the counter.
- **WARP_CARPET_LEFT/RIGHT**: Triggers map transition when walked onto.
