# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable standard ground.
- WALL / WINDOW / BUOY / ROCK: Impassable barriers.
- COUNTER: Impassable; interact with NPC behind it from adjacent tile.
- WATER: Traversable only while surfing. Requires Surf and Fog Badge.
- WHIRLPOOL: Impassable water hazard. Requires HM06 (Whirlpool).

# Lessons Learned
- Menu Precision: Slow down during move learning and item usage to avoid accidental deletions (e.g., Quick Attack on Turn 6098) or wrong item selection. Double-check before confirming.
- Route 41 Navigation: Buoy lines and islands create a maze; Row 29 is a reliable corridor west.
- Ecruteak Gym Path: (3,9)->(3,7)->(6,7)->(6,5)->(7,5)->Martha; (6,5)->(5,5)->(5,1)->Morty.
- Moomoo Farm: Sick Miltank needs 7 standard BERRY items.
