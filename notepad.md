## Active Quest: Find Granddaughter [Started Turn 37715]
- Clues: Granddaughter is missing.
- Strategy: Explore western B1F (via ladder at 5, 11) to find the Captain's cabin/bridge. The granddaughter should be there.
- Progress: Found the "lazy bum" buddy (Sailor Stanly) in a cabin on 1F; defeated him, which triggered the B1F sailors to return to duty.

## Kanto Strategy
- Target 1: Lt. Surge (Vermilion City).
- MVP: GNEISS (Graveler) Lv 51. Ground-type immunity to Electric.

## Lessons Learned
- S.S. Aqua sailors block corridors; they "shadow" movements if not triggered to move.
- Super Nerd (26, 9) blocks the x=26 corridor on B1F.
- Map transitions reset NPC positions.
- Path to western 1F is likely via B1F (East 1F -> East B1F -> West B1F -> West 1F).
- Finding a "goofing off" sailor usually requires catching them in a cabin or kitchen.
