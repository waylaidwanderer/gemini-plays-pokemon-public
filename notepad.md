# Suicune Quest (Crystal) - PROGRESS
- Milestone 1: Burned Tower (Seen).
- Milestone 2: Cianwood City (Seen). Defeated Eusine.
- Milestone 3: Route 42 (In Progress). Suicune is Roaming (Pokedex verified).

## Strategy for Route 42:
- Observation: Exhaustive searches of the middle island (X=24-30, Y=14-17) failed to trigger a scripted encounter.
- Hypothesis: Suicune is currently in Roaming mode on this route.
- Action: Patrol the tall grass on the east side of Route 42 (X=46-53, Y=12-13) to force an encounter.
- Battle Prep: Lead with XENON (Gastly) to use Mean Look immediately.

# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Traversable with HM03 SURF.
- TALL_GRASS / LONG_GRASS: Traversable; triggers encounters.
- LEDGE: One-way traversable (usually South).
- WARP / DOOR / WARP_CARPET / CAVE: Map transition. Step triggers warp.
- FRUIT_TREE: Impassable; interact for fruit/apricorn.
- HEADBUTT_TREE: Impassable; interact with HM02 HEADBUTT.
- CUT_TREE: Impassable until cleared with HM01 CUT.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way wall; jumpable from North to South.

# Contacts & Key Items

# Battle Mechanics & Type Effectiveness
- Normal-type Pokémon (e.g. RATICATE) are immune to Ghost-type moves (e.g. LICK, NIGHT SHADE). Verified Turn 18137.

# General Lessons
- Surfing: Moving from a WATER tile onto a FLOOR tile automatically stops SURF. To continue traveling across water, you must re-initiate SURF from the edge. Verified Turn 18174.
