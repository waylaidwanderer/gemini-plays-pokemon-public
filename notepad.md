# Dept Store Basement Notes

## Key Information
- **Goal:** Reach East side (Items/Ladder/Uniform?).
- **Current State:**
    - Top Gates (10, 8-9): OPEN (Floor).
    - Bottom Gates (10, 12-13): CLOSED (Wall/Box).
    - North East Item/Ladder: Blocked by Wall at Row 4.

## Puzzle Status: FAILED Hypotheses
1. **NPC Facing Direction:** Making NPCs face Up/Left/Right did NOT open gates.
2. **NPC Position:** NPC 5's patrol loop (9, 9 to 9, 11) does NOT trigger gates.
3. **"Behind the Scenes":** Entering the East Room (out of sight) did NOT change gate state.
4. **Map Reload:** Exiting/Re-entering via Elevator did NOT reset gate state.
5. **Physical Interaction:**
    - **Pushing:** Machoke (7, 7) and Boxes at (10, 12) and (6, 8) are **solid WALLs**. Strength failed.
    - **Hidden Items:** Itemfinder at (6, 7) and (11, 11) found NOTHING.

## Tile Mechanics
- **BOXES:** Behave as static **WALL** tiles. Not pushable with Strength. Not interactable.
- **GATES:** The tiles at (10, 12-13) are WALLs (Closed). Tiles at (10, 8-9) are FLOOR (Open).

## Conclusion & Pivot
- **Assessment:** The "Junk" hint and NPC behaviors suggest a puzzle, but all physical and logical interactions have failed.
- **Likelihood:** I am likely missing a key item (e.g., Basement Key) or a story trigger (Director event).
- **Action:** Abandoning B1F for now.
- **Next Destination:** Radio Tower (Goldenrod North). Need to verify exactly what is blocking the path there (Guard? Door?).

## Important Locations (Goldenrod)
- **Radio Tower:** North.
- **Underground:** Key item (Coin Case) was found here. Potential other items?
- **Director:** Potentially held captive?
