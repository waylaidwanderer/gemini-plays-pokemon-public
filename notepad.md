# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Investigate Team Rocket Hideout.
- **Secondary Goal:** Access B3F Boss Room (NW Corner).
- **Status:**
    - Passwords "SLOWPOKETAIL" and "RATICATE TAIL" obtained.
    - B2F Locked Doors (14,12 & 15,12) require Executive/Murkrow (Transmitter Room).
    - B3F Boss Room is walled off from the East/South.
    - B2F West is split by a wall at Row 12. Northern part (with Item Ball) is unreachable from South.
- **Hypothesis:** A hidden path (stairs/hole/trap) exists in the B1F North-West corner (x=1-5, y=1-5) leading to B2F North-West.

## Team Rocket Hideout Status
- **B3F:** Boss Room unlocked. Executive defeated. Murkrow has the password.
- **B2F:** Lance met. West Ladder (3,14) connects to B1F. Locked doors need password.
- **B1F:** Security disabled. Trap Warp at (5,15).

## Tile Mechanics
- **Trap Tiles:** B1F corridors (Geodude/Voltorb/Koffing).
- **Security Cameras:** Trigger alarms/battles.
- **Locked Doors:** Require specific triggers (Passwords or Key Items).

## Action Log & Reflection
- **Status:** Exiting Team Rocket Hideout.
- **Trap Analysis:** Traps confirmed on cols 3, 4, and 5. Safest path appears to be hugging the wall at x=1 or x=2.
- **Current Task:** Retrieve Item Ball at (27, 6) before leaving.
- **Plan:**
    1. Navigate North using Col 1 (avoiding traps and Grunt at 2,4).
    2. Cross to Row 3, then use Gap at (9, 4) to access Row 5.
    3. Navigate around barrier at (24, 5) to reach Item at (27, 6).
    4. Backtrack through Gap to reach Exit Ladder at (27, 2).
    5. Heal and challenge Gym.
- **Inventory Note:** HM06 (Whirlpool) obtained. Need Badge to use it.
