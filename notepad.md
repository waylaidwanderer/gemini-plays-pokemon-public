# Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR:** Standard walkable tile.

- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN:** One-way jumpable ledge (South).
- **TALL_GRASS:** Wild Pokemon encounters.
- **WATER:** Requires Surf.
- **LADDER:** Walkable (bridge).
- **CUT_TREE:** Requires Cut.
- Found the path to Route 9! It was a gap in the wall at (36, 22), bypassing the cuttable tree.
- Heading East to enter Route 9 and find the Power Plant.
- **Route 9 Navigation:**
  - **Structure:** Split into Upper (Grass, Trainers) and Lower (One-way West) paths by ledges.
  - **Issue:** Entered via Lower path (gap at 7_17 (36,22)). Stuck below ledges.
  - **Solution:** Return to Cerulean City and find a Northern entrance to access the Upper path.
  - **Status:** The "Cut Tree" at (33, 24) is UNCUTTABLE (confirmed). Must loop back West and North.
  - **Timestamp:** Turn 21458 - Backtracking to find Northern path (target approx 33, 12).
- Navigation Correction: Lower Route 9 path is a dead end. Cut tree at (33, 24) is uncuttable.
- New Path: Loop West to X=6, go North through the gap at (6, 19), then East along Row 17/10 to reach (33, 12) from the North.
- Target: Reach (6, 24) first.
- Navigation Success: Bypassed the stunned Super Nerd. Currently at the Northern Route 9 entrance (27, 12).
- Detour: Investigating an unmarked house at (28, 17) before heading East to Route 9.
- Note: Access to (28, 17) requires looping around the block via (24, 18).
- Police Station Investigation: The "Fishing Guru" (Chief?) mentioned they were held up by robbers. Possible connection to the Power Plant commotion?
- Plan: Resume travel to Route 9 via the Northern entrance at (27, 12).
