## Strategy: Northern Island Bypass to Suicune
**Start Turn:** 48900 (Quest: Trigger Suicune Overworld Sighting)

Cianwood is a maze of 'FLOOR_UP_WALL' barriers in the south. I will use the northern water channel and a central landing point at Row 18 to reach the West Beach.

### Step-by-Step Execution Plan
1. Surf North in the eastern channel to (29, 8). <- CURRENT TASK
2. Surf West through the buoy gap at (22, 8) to (21, 8).
3. Surf South to (21, 18).
4. Surf West and land on the island at (17, 18).
5. Walk West to (15, 18), then Surf across the 1-tile pond at (14, 18) to land at (13, 18).
6. Walk West to (4, 18), then North to the beach gap at (4, 14).
7. Walk West to (2, 14), then North to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

## Tile Mechanics: Cianwood City
- FLOOR: Standard traversable ground.
- WALL: Standard impassable barrier.
- WATER: Traversable only with Surf HM.
- BUOY: Impassable water barrier.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable from the North. Behaves like a wall when moving Down into it.

## Failed Hypotheses & Lessons
- Great Sea Bypass (Route 40): Dead end on the West.
- Southern Crossing (Row 48/51): Blocked by multiple 'FLOOR_UP_WALL' lines at Rows 46 and 50.
- Inner Channel North (X=13-17): Blocked at Row 15 by a solid wall of WALL tiles.

## Inventory Check
- Super Repel: 5 remaining. Last applied turn 49278. (~195 steps remaining).

## Battle Strategy: Eusine
- Lead: Calcifer (Lv 64 Typhlosion).
- Strategy: Sweep with Flamethrower. OHKO potential on most targets.
