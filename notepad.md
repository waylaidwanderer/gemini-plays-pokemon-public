# Current Objectives
*   **Primary Goal:** Obtain the Boulder Badge from the Pewter City Gym Leader, Brock.
*   **Secondary Goal:** Gain EXP for FLAREE. Earn funds for Potions/Pok√© Balls (target: Route 2 / Pewter City).
*   **Tertiary Goal:** Reach Pewter City.

# Game Mechanics & Strategy
*   **Ledge Mechanics:** One-way (downwards only). Cannot move UP onto a ledge from a lower Y.
*   **Movement Mechanic:** 1st press TURNS if not facing, 2nd press MOVES. **Pikachu Movement:** Pikachu does not block movement. If not facing Pikachu and attempting to move onto Pikachu's tile, the first directional input *towards* Pikachu causes the player to turn and face Pikachu. A *second* directional input towards Pikachu is then required to step onto Pikachu's tile. This applies only when moving *into* Pikachu's current tile; normal movement applies otherwise. If already facing Pikachu, one press moves onto the tile.
*   **Level Cap:** 0 badges = Lv12. EXP gain stops at cap. Wild battles give no money.
*   **Data Trust:** Game State Information is absolute truth.
*   **Pathing:** Validate agent paths with `move_validator_agent` or use short, verifiable segments.
*   **Map Marker Usage:** üö´ (dead ends/impassable), üìç (nav points), üö™ (used warps), ‚ò†Ô∏è (defeated trainers), ‚ùó/üíÅ (event NPCs/blockers), üöß (ledges).
*   **Battle Strategy:** Use `select_battle_option` tool for main battle menu. Remember to switch Pok√©mon for EXP distribution (e.g., lead with lower level Pok√©mon like FLAREE).

# Party Updates (Viridian Forest - Turn 4818)
*   FLAREE (VULPIX): Lv8 (6/26 HP, EXP: 704) | Moves: EMBER (12 PP), TAIL WHIP (30 PP), QUICK ATTACK (30 PP) - Critically low HP. Training is too risky. Must be kept benched and safe until healed. Prioritize earning money for healing.
*   SPBARKY (PIKACHU): Lv12 (38/39 HP, EXP: 1728) | Moves: THUNDERSHOCK (29 PP), TAIL WHIP (30 PP), QUICK ATTACK (30 PP), THUNDER WAVE (20 PP) (Level Cap Reached)
*   SPROUT (ODDISH): Lv12 (33/37 HP, EXP: 973) | Moves: TACKLE (30 PP), POISONPOWDER (35 PP), LEECH SEED (10 PP) (Level Cap Reached)

# Post-Viridian Forest Plan Notes
*   Party reordered to lead with FLAREE (Complete).
*   Solidify plan for acquiring funds on Route 2/Pewter City: identify specific trainers to battle or item sale strategy.

# Key Journey Events & Map Discoveries
*   **Viridian Forest Training (Current):** SPROUT reached Lv12 cap. FLAREE gaining EXP from wild battles. Navigating towards northern exit.
*   **Pewter City Navigation:** Repeatedly blocked by Youngster escort event and dynamic tile changes. Learned to use `map_analyzer_agent` and validate paths. Pewter PC non-functional.
*   **Route 2:** Caught FLAREE (Vulpix). Navigated ledges.
*   **Viridian Forest (Previous):** Trained SPROUT to Lv12. Defeated Bug Catchers & Youngsters. Encountered several non-battling NPC blockers. Noted impassable tiles: (9,27), (11,27), (13,31), (19,21), (25,17), (27,18 sign), (28,45), (29,21), (15,47), (17,33 sign), (16,32), (20,36), Youngster (ID1) at (17,44) is a blocker.
*   **Viridian City Pokecenter Navigation:** Multiple attempts to reach Pokecenter due to ledges and impassable walls. Eventually succeeded.

# Agent & Pathing Notes
*   **`map_analyzer_agent` Issues:** Provided flawed paths multiple times (e.g., Turn 4706 to Viridian Pokecenter, Turn 4707 in Viridian Forest to (20,36), Turn 4707 path to (2,1)). Paths need strict validation (use `move_validator_agent`) or execution in smaller, verifiable segments. Prompt needs update (navigability, warps).
*   **`exploration_planner_agent` Limitation:** Failed to path to known exit when no unseen tiles (Turn 4698). Prompt needs update for direct pathing scenarios.
*   **Youngster Gym Escort Event (Pewter City):** Youngster NPC (ID 5), found near eastern side of city (e.g. (36,17)), triggers an escort to the Gym entrance at (12,19). Dialogue after escort: "If you have the right stuff, go take on BROCK!". This NPC does not battle for funds. The trigger zone was previously noted near (38,19) but also occurred from interaction at (35,17). (Confirmed Turn 5144).

# Agent Management (Pewter Pokecenter - Turn 4933)
*   **High Priority Agents Defined/Updated:**
    *   `scripted_event_tracker_agent`: Defined.
    *   `route_progress_analyzer_agent`: Defined.
    *   `battle_log_analyzer_agent`: Defined.
    *   `map_analyzer_agent`: Prompt updated (enforced `navigable="true"`, warp handling, check markers/NPCs).
    *   `exploration_planner_agent`: Prompt updated (direct pathing if no unseen tiles & target provided).
*   **Agents Deleted to Make Space:**
    *   `item_finder_agent`
    *   `pokedex_completer_agent`
*   **Remaining Agent Ideas/TODOs:**
    *   `notepad_query_agent`: Define (New Idea: Searches notepad for specific info). (Need to delete another agent first)
    *   Review prompts for `team_builder_agent` and `leveling_training_advisor_agent` for Hard Mode relevance or delete them if space is needed.

# Inventory & Finances
*   POK√© BALL x1
*   Money: ¬•156 (Critically Low)

# Pokedex Status
*   Caught: 3/151 (PIKACHU, ODDISH, VULPIX)

*   **Viridian Forest (Current):** Blocked at (19,21) (impassable) when trying to move South from (19,20). Tile (20,20) also confirmed impassable from previous observation.

*   **Viridian Forest (Current):** Blocked at (11,20) (impassable) when trying to move Left from (12,20).

*   **Viridian Forest (Current):** Blocked at (6,2) (impassable) when trying to move Left from (7,2). Current position (7,2) facing Left. Pikachu at (8,2). Revising path to exit at (2,1) by first heading south.

*   **Immediate Post-Healing Priority (Complete - Turn 4934):** Defined/updated high-priority agents (scripted_event_tracker, route_progress_analyzer, map_analyzer, exploration_planner) before leaving Pokecenter.

# Pewter Pokecenter Navigation Notes
*   The tile (4,4) where Pikachu often stands is navigable. The correct Nurse interaction spot is (4,5). A previous note incorrectly stated (4,4) was `navigable="false"`. The persistent collision error previously reported when moving from (3,4) to (4,4) (citing an object at (5,4)) needs further investigation if it recurs, but alternative pathing can bypass it.

# Hindsight & Lessons Learned (Consolidated)
*   **Data Integrity:** Prioritize XML map data over screen annotations for tile properties (navigability, type).
*   **NPCs & Interaction:**
    *   Verify NPC locations using `Map Sprites` data *each turn* before pathing or interacting.
    *   Use `npc_interaction_planner_agent` proactively in complex/unfamiliar areas or when encountering interaction issues.
*   **Pathing & Navigation:**
    *   For long/complex paths (e.g., Viridian Forest), use `move_validator_agent` or break into smaller, verifiable segments (5-10 steps).
    *   Prioritize exploring closer alternatives before extensive backtracking.
*   **Agent Strategy:**
    *   Act on planned agent definitions/updates promptly (e.g., at PC visits).
    *   Proactively use query agents like `map_analyzer_agent` to confirm tile properties before committing to movement, especially if screen annotations conflict with XML.
    *   Trust agent pathing logic more; refine prompts if outputs are consistently problematic rather than frequently overriding manually.
*   **Risk Management:** Avoid multiple risky battles with critically low HP Pok√©mon unless reward outweighs risk of blackout. Prioritize healing vulnerable key party members.
*   **Notepad Edits:** Ensure `old_text` for "replace" actions is exact and matches the *most recent* notepad version.
*   **Agents Defined/Deleted:**
    *   `notepad_query_agent` (Defined Turn 5004)
    *   `leveling_training_advisor_agent` (Deleted Turn 5003)
    *   `exploration_planner` (old version) (Deleted Turn 5002)

# Party & Gameplay Notes (Post-Turn 4994)
*   Current Party Order: SPARKY (lead), FLAREE, SPROUT.
*   Turn Number Correction: Turn 4951 was actually 4952.
*   Menu Navigation: Investigate issues with Pok√©mon switching menu sequence. The game seems to process only one button press at a time if it changes the menu state, leading to errors if multiple are queued. Be more methodical with single button presses in complex menus.

# Route 2 Exploration (Turn 5047)
*   Explored northern section of Route 2 (south of Pewter City connection). No trainers found in this area. Funds remain at ¬•156.
*   Explored southern section of Route 2 (north of Viridian City connection, up to VF North Gate). No trainers found in this area either.

# Current Plan of Action (Turn 5157)
1.  **Immediate Goal:** Explore the eastern map connection from Pewter City to find trainers or other resources for funds.
2.  **Rationale:** All known trainers in Pewter City are non-battling. Funds are critically low (¬•156), and FLAREE (6HP) needs healing.
3.  **Party Management:** Keep FLAREE benched. SPARKY or SPROUT (both Lv12 cap) will lead to maximize escape chance from wild encounters if not training.
4.  **Contingency:** If the eastern route yields no funds, re-evaluate options. This might include selling items (Pok√© Ball is the only one, not ideal), or exploring other accessible routes if any exist and were missed.
5.  **Long-term:** After securing funds and healing FLAREE, reassess readiness for challenging Brock.

# Pewter City Navigation Notes (Continued)
*   Column X=22 has several impassable segments: (22,22), (22,25), (22,26), (22,27). This blocks east-west travel through rows 22, 25, 26, 27 at this column.

- Cool Trainer M (ID 2) at (18,26) in Pewter City is non-battling. (Confirmed Turn 5093).

- Super Nerd (ID 4, PEWTERCITY_SUPER_NERD2) is located at (25,26) in Pewter City, currently facing Right. He blocks movement onto his tile. (Observed Turn 5098)

# Pewter City Trainers
*   JR.TRAINER‚ôÇ (Cool Trainer M) in Gym (Diglett Lv9, Sandshrew Lv9): Defeated (Turn 4004), ¬•180.
*   Gym Leader Brock (Geodude Lv10, Onix Lv14): Lost (Turn 4016).
*   Cool Trainer M (ID 2) at (18,26): Non-battling. Dialogue: "PEWTER GYM's BROCK is totally into it!" (Confirmed Turn 5093). No funds gained.
*   Super Nerd (ID 4, PEWTERCITY_SUPER_NERD2) at (24,26) facing Right: Non-battling. Dialogue: "That's right! It's hard work!" (Confirmed Turn 5107). No funds gained.
*   Super Nerd (ID 3, PEWTERCITY_SUPER_NERD1) at (28,18) facing Up: Non-battling. Dialogue: "Weren't those fossils from MT. MOON amazing?" (Confirmed Turn 5134). No funds gained.

*   Tile (35,22) changed from ground to impassable during movement on Turn 5115. This occurred while pathing towards Super Nerd (ID 3) but was not on the direct path.

*   Tile (35,21) changed from ground to impassable during movement on Turn 5117. This occurred while pathing towards Super Nerd (ID 3) but was not on the direct path.

*   Tile (34,20) changed from ground to impassable during movement on Turn 5120.
*   Tile (35,20) changed from impassable to ground during movement on Turn 5120.

*   Tile (35,16) changed from ground to impassable during movement on Turn 5123.

*   Tile (35,15) changed from ground to impassable during movement on Turn 5126.

*   Tiles (27,15), (27,16), (27,17), and (27,18) changed from impassable to ground during movement on Turn 5129.

# Pewter City Navigation Notes (Continued)
*   Police Notice Sign at (34,20) is an impassable obstacle on a ground tile.

# Pewter City Dynamic Tile Changes (Consolidated)
*   Column 35: (35,23) ground -> impassable (Turn 5112). (35,22) ground -> impassable (Turn 5115). (35,21) ground -> impassable (Turn 5117). (35,16) ground -> impassable (Turn 5123). (35,15) ground -> impassable (Turn 5126).
*   Column 34/35 Row 20: (34,20) ground -> impassable, (35,20) impassable -> ground (Turn 5120).
*   Column 27: (27,15), (27,16), (27,17), (27,18) all impassable -> ground (Turn 5129).

# Hindsight & Lessons Learned
*   NPC Interaction: Consistently verify NPC locations using `Map Sprites` data *before* planning paths. Use `npc_interaction_planner_agent` proactively, especially in unfamiliar or complex areas like Pewter City, to avoid repeated blockages and wasted turns from misjudging interaction tiles or NPC positions.
*   Agent Usage: Be more proactive in using query agents like `map_analyzer_agent` to confirm tile properties (e.g., navigability, presence of blocking objects) before committing to movement, especially if screen annotations seem to conflict with expectations or XML data.

# Agent Brainstorming & Review (Post-Turn 5149)
*   **New Agent Ideas:**
    *   `battle_strategy_advisor_agent`: (PRIORITY - Define Next) Suggests moves in battle based on type matchups, PP, HP, etc.
    *   `rom_hack_mechanics_discoverer_agent`: Hypothesizes game mechanics from observed anomalies.
    *   `potion_purchase_optimizer_agent`: Optimizes healing item purchases based on funds and needs.
*   **Existing Agent Review:**
    *   `team_builder_agent`: Prompt needs more emphasis on Hard Mode rules (no items, set mode, level caps).
