## Active Quest: Find Granddaughter [Started Turn 37715]
- Clues: Granddaughter is missing; sailor (ID 2) on B1F is looking for his buddy; buddy is "goofing off".
- Strategy: Defeat Sailor Stanly (the 'lazy bum' buddy found in cabin 15_4). After the battle, he should return to duty, clearing the path on B1F.
- Hypothesis: Defeating Sailor Stanly triggers him and the B1F sailor to move.
- Quest started: Turn 37715 (Timestamp: Friday, Jan 9, 2026, 6:00 PM).
- Battle Log: Turn 38024 - Calcifer (Lv 57) vs Stanly's Machop (Lv 31) (Defeated).
- Battle Log: Turn 38026 - Calcifer (Lv 57) vs Stanly's Machoke (Lv 33) (Defeated).
- Battle Log: Turn 38028 - Calcifer (Lv 58) vs Stanly's Psyduck (Lv 26) (Defeated).
- Progress: Defeated Sailor Stanly in cabin 15_4. He admitted his fault and left.
- Strategy: Return to B1F to see if the sailor blocking the path north has moved.

## Kanto Strategy
- Goal: Collect 8 Kanto badges.
- Target 1: Lt. Surge (Vermilion City).
- MVP: GNEISS (Graveler) Lv 51. Ground-type immunity to Electric.

## Lessons Learned
- S.S. Aqua sailors block corridors; they "shadow" movements if not triggered to move.
- Super Nerd (26, 9) blocks the x=26 corridor on B1F.
- Map transitions reset NPC positions.
- Path to western 1F is likely via B1F (East 1F -> East B1F -> West B1F -> West 1F).
