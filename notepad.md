- **Reasoning**:
  1. Main Battle Menu is visible. Cursor is on **FIGHT**.
  2. **Action**: Pressing 'A' to open the Move Selection Menu.
  3. **Hypothesis**: Cursor *should* be on **FLAME WHEEL** (Slot 4) since I used it last turn.

     - If on Slot 1 (Dig) -> Press Down x3.

### Notes
- **Cianwood Pharmacy**: Supposed to have the SecretPotion.

- **Shuckle Guy**: Found at (17, 41) in Cianwood (Map 22_4). Offers a Shuckle to look after.
