# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Strategy: The Great Southern Loop (Row 51)
The northern plateau (14, 10) is accessible via the western coastal highway (X=2). All internal shortcuts are blocked by elevation traps. We must loop around the eastern side to reach the southern clearway at Row 51.

### Execution Plan
1. Reach Eastern Shore: Navigate to (23, 33). (In Progress)
2. Ocean Transit: Surf south along X=24 to Row 51.
3. Southern Crossing: Land at (23, 51) and walk west along Row 51 to (2, 51).
4. Coastal Ascent: Walk north along X=2 to Row 12.
5. Final Approach: Walk east to (14, 12) and north to Suicune at (14, 10).

## Verified Mechanics
- Row 51: Completely clear land bridge across the bottom (X=2 to X=24).
- X=2 Highway: Clear north-south path from Row 51 to Row 12.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way. Blocks DOWN movement. (e.g., Row 50, (4, 30), (4, 20)).

## Battle Plan: Eusine
- Expected Team: Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25).
- Lead: Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion). Strategy: Flamethrower sweep.
