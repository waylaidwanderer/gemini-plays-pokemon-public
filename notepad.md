# I. Core Principles
- **Immediate Action is Non-Negotiable:** All documentation, agent creation, and tool refinement must be performed in the current turn.
- **Systematic Hypothesis Testing:** Form single, testable hypotheses and document each test, its outcome, and my conclusion to avoid repeated failures.
- **Leverage Automation:** Use custom agents for complex reasoning and tools for repetitive calculations to improve efficiency.

# III. Puzzle & Progression Log (Solved)
- **Pokémon Mansion:** To open the main path on 1F, both basement switches (at (21, 4) and (19, 26)) must be activated.
- **Cinnabar Gym:** The puzzle is sequential. Defeat trainers or solve quizzes to open gates to the next section.
- **Viridian Gym:** The spinner maze is solved. The path to Giovanni is known and recorded in past logs.

# IV. Tile Mechanics & Movement Rules
- **`ground`**: Standard walkable tile.
- **`grass`**: Walkable tile where wild Pokémon can be encountered.
- **`water`**: Traversable only with the Surf field move.
- **`impassable`**: Walls, objects, and other solid barriers.
- **`cuttable`**: A tree that can be removed with the Cut field move.
- **`ledge`**: Can be jumped down, but not climbed up.
- **`spinner`**: Forces movement in a specific direction.
- **`warp`**: A tile that teleports the player to another location (e.g., doors, stairs).
- **`steps`**: Allows vertical movement between different ground elevations.

# V. Active Plans & Hypotheses
## A. Route 13 Exploration
- **Objective:** Navigate the Route 13 maze and reach the western exit to Route 14.
- **Hypothesis 1:** The marker at (1, 7) 'To Route 14 (Dead End)' is incorrect. The game state indicates it's a valid connection.
  - **Test:** Navigate to the western exit of Route 13 and attempt to transition to Route 14.
  - **Plan:** 
    1. Navigate the eastern section of the maze, defeating any remaining trainers.
    2. Find the path that leads to the western section.
    3. Systematically explore the western section until the exit at (1, 9) or (1, 7) is reached.
    4. Attempt to walk west into the map connection.
- **Conclusion:** (To be filled in after test)

## B. Untested Assumptions (Route 14)
- **Hypothesis 2:** The cuttable tree at (4, 43) is the only way to access the western portion of Route 14.
  - **Test:** Use Cut on the tree. Observe if a new path opens.
  - **Conclusion:** (To be filled in)
- **Hypothesis 3:** All Biker trainers on this route are hostile and will initiate a battle.
  - **Test:** Approach each Biker that is not marked as defeated.
  - **Conclusion:** (To be filled in)
