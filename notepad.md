## Current Strategy & Obstacles
- **Location:** Radio Tower 4F.
- **Goal:** Reach Director on 5F.
- **Status:** Exploring West side of 4F.
- **Layout:** Room divided West/East. East side appears inaccessible from here (blocked by walls).
- **Hypothesis:** Stairs to 5F (Director's location) are likely hidden on the West side, possibly behind the Scientist at (4, 2) or in the unexplored top-left corner.
- **Plan:** Navigate to (4, 3) to engage Scientist and explore the area.
