## Strategy: West Beach Highway Route to Suicune
Use the 'West Beach Highway' (X=0-2) to reach the northern plateau, bypassing the central city blockades.

### Step-by-Step Execution Plan
1. Land at (12, 28) and walk to (12, 44). <- CURRENT TASK
2. (12, 44) -> (9, 44): Pass through the X=9 wall gap.
3. (9, 44) -> (8, 44) -> (8, 35): Walk north through the city corridor.
4. (8, 35) -> (5, 35): Pass through the X=5 wall gap to the beach.
5. (5, 35) -> (2, 35): Reach the West Beach Highway.
6. (2, 35) -> (2, 14): Walk north along the beach highway.
7. (2, 14) -> (8, 14): Cross east to the plateau entrance.
8. (8, 14) -> (8, 10): Walk north to the plateau summit.
9. (8, 10) -> (14, 10): Reach Suicune trigger point.
