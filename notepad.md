# Suicune Quest (Crystal) - PROGRESS
- Milestone 1: Burned Tower (Seen).
- Milestone 2: Cianwood City (Seen).
- Milestone 3: Route 42 (Seen).
- Milestone 4: Route 36 (Seen).
- Milestone 5: Tin Tower (Battled).
- Status: Roaming. Goal: Catch Suicune.
- Note: Pokedex AREA map shows Suicune on Route 42. This confirms Roaming mode.

## Strategy for Catching Suicune
1. Navigate to tall grass at (46, 12) on Route 42.
2. Patrol grass until Suicune appears.
3. Lead with XENON (Gastly) and use MEAN LOOK immediately.
4. Use HYPNOSIS to sleep, then lower HP.

# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Traversable with HM03 SURF.
- TALL_GRASS: Traversable; triggers encounters.
- LEDGE: One-way traversable.
- WARP / DOOR: Map transition.
- HEADBUTT_TREE: Impassable; interact with HM02.
- CUT_TREE: Impassable until cleared with HM01.

# PC Storage (Box 1)
- RICOTTA (Raticate 16), CINNABAR (Goldeen 21), VORTEX (Poliwag 22), INTERCEPT (Yanma 12), ROCKY (Onix 6), EGG (CleFFA 5), XFDW (Meowth 16), FRITTATA (Togepi 5), SHUCKIE (Shuckle 15), Blarney (Sudowoodo 20).

# Lessons Learned
- Roaming Logic: Pokedex AREA map showing a route means Suicune is roaming. Transitions change its location.
- Verification: Always check inventory (Clear Bell) and badges (7/8) to verify quest status.
- Navigation: Surfing ends when stepping on FLOOR. Must re-initiate from water edge.
