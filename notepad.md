# Suicune Quest (Crystal) - FIXED SIGHTINGS
- Milestone 1: Burned Tower (Seen).
- Milestone 2: Cianwood City (Seen). Defeated Eusine.
- Milestone 3: Route 42 (In Progress). Pokedex confirms location.
- Milestone 4: Route 36 (Next).
- Milestone 5: Tin Tower (Final). Requirement: Clear Bell (OBTAINED) + all sightings.

## Strategy for Route 42 Sighting:
- Location: Middle island (X=24-32, Y=14-16) or northern corridor (Row 4).
- Approach: Surf to landing points. Island center requires CUT at (24, 13).
- Goal: Approach Suicune sprite to trigger flight cutscene.

## Failed Hypotheses (Route 42)
- Sweep of island floor (Rows 14-15) [Turns 17819-17863].
- Apricorn tree interactions [Turns 17804-17818].
- Western mainland sweep (X=1-12) [Turns 17836-17871].
- Mt. Mortar B1F Exploration [Turns 17881-17935].

# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way traversable (usually North). Acts as a wall from the North.
- WATER_ROCKS: Impassable.
- CUT_TREE: Impassable until HM01 CUT.
- WATER: Traversable with HM03 SURF.
- TALL_GRASS / LONG_GRASS: Traversable; triggers encounters.
- LEDGE: One-way traversable (usually South).
- WARP / DOOR / WARP_CARPET / CAVE: Map transition.
- FRUIT_TREE: Impassable; interact for fruit/apricorn.

# PC Storage (Box 1)
- VORTEX (Poliwag 22), INTERCEPT (Yanma 12), ROCKY (Onix 6), EGG (CleFFA 5), XFDW (Meowth 16), FRITTATA (Togepi 5), SHUCKIE (Shuckle 15), Blarney (Sudowoodo 20).

# Contacts & Key Items
- Fire Stone: Route 36 (Alan).
- Rock Smash (Info): Route 36 (Fisher).
- Fisher Tully: Route 42. Gives items.
- Bug Catcher Arnie: Route 35. Reports Yanma swarms.
- Clear Bell: Obtained.

# Task Timestamps & Log
- Suicune Hunt (Route 42): Started Turn 17642.
- Discovery: Pokedex 'AREA' shows 'SUICUNE'S NEST' with dots across Johto.
- Discovery: Pokedex 'SUICUNE'S NEST' dots confirm sightings at Ecruteak (Burned Tower), Cianwood, Route 42, Route 36, and Tin Tower.
- Plan: Cut tree at (24, 13) and perform 100% sweep of island center (Rows 14-15). [Turn 17947]
- Observation: Island center (Rows 14-16) is fully visible and empty. No Suicune sprite found.
- Hypothesis 38: Suicune is located in the northern corridor (Row 4) reachable by surfing North from the eastern side of the route. [Turn 17950]
