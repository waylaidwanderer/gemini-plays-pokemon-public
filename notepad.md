# Suicune Capture Strategy (Crystal Version)
## Primary Goal: Capture Suicune
- **Step 1: Obtain Clear Bell.** (COMPLETE)
- **Step 2: Access Tin Tower.** Defeat the Wise Trio in Ecruteak City. (COMPLETE)
- **Step 3: Encounter Suicune at Tin Tower.** (COMPLETE - It fled).
- **Step 4: Track Suicune.** Use the Pokédex to locate it on the map.
- **Step 5: Prepare Catcher.** Obtain a Pokémon with Sleep/Paralysis and a move like False Swipe. Parasect (Route 24/25, Ilex Forest) is ideal (Spore + False Swipe).
- **Step 6: Execute Capture.** Corner Suicune -> Use Mean Look or Spider Web (to prevent escape) -> False Swipe to 1 HP -> Status (Sleep preferred) -> Ultra/Level Balls.

## Global Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR:** Standard traversal in all directions.
- **WALL / FENCE:** Impassable.
- **TALL_GRASS:** Standard traversal; triggers wild Pokémon encounters.
- **WATER:** Requires HM03 SURF to traverse.

- **WARP (Door, Stairs, Carpet):** Transports player to a different map or location.
- **HEADBUTT_TREE:** Impassable. Can be interacted with using Headbutt.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** One-way movement (North only). Blocks southward movement.

## Type Effectiveness Chart (Observed)
- **Ghost:** Immune to Normal and Fighting moves.
- **Normal:** Immune to Ghost moves.
- **Grass vs. Bug/Flying:** Not very effective (Observed: KIMCHI's Absorb vs. Yanma).
- **Bug vs. Poison/Grass:** Not very effective (Observed: Yanma's Leech Life vs. Gloom).

## Exploration & Navigation
- **Route 32 Goal:** Reveal 100%. Use SURF at y=40-50 to reach the western corridor.
- **Lessons:** Menu navigation (Start, Party, Battle) wraps. Always verify cursor position.

## NPCs & Locations
- **Fisher Tully:** (15, 13) Route 32. Contact for fishing info (Route 42).
- **Arnie (Bug Catcher):** Route 35. Reports swarms (e.g., Yanma) and rare sightings.

## Event: Yanma Swarm
- **Location:** Route 35.
- **Strategy:** Use KIMCHI (Gloom) for Sleep Powder status.
- **Battle Plan:** Sleep Powder -> Great Balls. Yanma is fragile; avoid damaging further.

## Wild Encounters (Route 35)
- DITTO (Lv 10)
- PIDGEY (Lv 12, 14)
- NIDORAN♀/♂ (Lv 12)
- YANMA (Lv 12) - Swarm active.
