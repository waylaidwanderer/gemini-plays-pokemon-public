# Cianwood City Progression
## Strategy: Trigger Suicune Sighting at (14, 10)
- **Start Turn:** 50283 (Thursday, Jan 15, 2026, 10:30 PM PST)
- **Status:** In Progress. Verified that Rock Smash is required for the land bypass.
- **Route:** Wall Gap (5, 34) -> Terrace Ascent (4, 30), (4, 20) -> Northern Loop (14, 10).

## Strategy: Finding TM08 Rock Smash
- **Start Turn:** 50283
- **Status:** Searching for the TM. Verified that Pokefan M in Cianwood is a dead end (G/S only). TM08 is on Route 36 in Crystal.
- **Plan:**
  1. Investigate Lugia Speech House (15, 37). (Completed)
  2. Navigate to Suicune (14, 10) via the Eastern Water Route (Surf).
  3. Obtain TM08 Rock Smash from Route 36 NPC after clearing the Suicune event.

## Global Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable.
- WATER: Requires Surf.
- DOOR / WARP_CARPET: Warp point.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way South jump.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way North climb.
- SMASHABLE_ROCK (Object): Impassable. Requires Rock Smash.

## General Lessons
- **NPC Interaction:** Intercepting moving NPCs is more reliable than chasing them. Position in their walking path and wait.

## Failed Hypotheses
- Pokefan M (Main map): Hint only (Turn 50278, 50281). Possibly requires specific front-facing interaction or trigger.
- Mania (2, 4): Dead end (asks for Shuckle).
- Lass (14, 44): Dead end (talks about Chuck).

## Strategy: The Eastern Water Route (Surf)
- **Goal:** Reach Suicune at (14, 10) without Rock Smash.
- **Steps:**
  1. Navigate to the Surf spot at (12, 28).
  2. Surf North to (14, 16).
  3. Land West on the plateau at (13, 16).
  4. Walk North to (14, 10).
