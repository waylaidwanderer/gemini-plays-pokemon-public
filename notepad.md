# Strategic Notes
## Objectives
- **Primary:** Complete Pokedex.
- **Secondary:** Hunt Roaming Beasts (Raikou/Entei).
- **Navigation:** Return to Ecruteak City.

## Roamer Hunt
- **Target:** Raikou & Entei.
- **Method:** Route 37 Loop.
- **Note:** No trapper in party. Goal is to encounter for Dex tracking.

## Observations & Tips
- **Menu Navigation:** `navigate_menu` can register double inputs. Use `press_buttons` for precision if needed.

- **Exploration:** Unmarked warps at (16,3) & (17,3) (Celadon Mansion back?).

# Current Strategy
## Roamer Hunt (Raikou/Entei)
- **Goal:** Encounter Raikou and Entei.
- **Location:** Route 37 (Current).
- **Setup:** Apply Super Repel.
- **Hunting Loop:**
  1. Start at Route 37 Gate (8,0).
  2. Walk South into Grass (approx 8,3).
  3. If no encounter, Walk North to Ecruteak.
  4. Re-enter Route 37.
  5. Repeat.
- **Mechanics:** Changing maps moves Roamers. Repel filters normal wilds (Lvl < 36). Roamers are Lvl 40.
- **Supplies:** 10 Super Repels.

## Map Notes
- **Route 37:** Grass patches at (6,2)-(9,5).
- **Ecruteak City:** Connection North.
