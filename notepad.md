# Strategy: The Suicune Pursuit
- **Objective:** Trigger Suicune sighting at (14, 10) in northern Cianwood City.
- **Eusine Battle Prep:** Be prepared for a battle immediately after Suicune bolts.
  - **Eusine's Roster:** Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25).
  - **Strategy:** Lead with Lv64 Calcifer (Typhlosion). Sweep with Flamethrower or Thunderpunch for a clean sweep.
- **Navigation Plan (Surf Route):**
  1. Walk to (19, 30).
  2. Surf East to (20, 30) and continue to X=23.
  3. Surf North to Row 10.
  4. Surf West to (19, 10) and land at (16, 10).
  5. Approach (14, 10) to trigger the event.

# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard traversable terrain.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable terrain.
- WATER: Traversable only with Surf.
- DOOR / WARP_CARPET: Map transition points.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Allows jumping down (South) but blocks movement from the opposite direction (North).
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Terrace edges. (6, 46) allows climbing West onto the terrace.
- ROCK (Object): Blocks movement; can be cleared with Rock Smash. Respawns upon map transition.

# Lessons Learned
- **Cianwood Pathing:** (11, 15) leads to a dead-end pocket at (11, 14). Do not use for northern access.
- **Respawn Logic:** Overworld rocks (like the one at 5, 29) respawn when leaving and re-entering the map.
- **Poke Seer's House:** (5, 17) is a regular interior, not a shortcut to the north.
