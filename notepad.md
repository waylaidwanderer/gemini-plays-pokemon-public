# Global Mechanics
## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement. Allows NORTH movement. Found at Rows 34, 46, 48, 50.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at (10, 15).
- WALL: Impassable.
- ROCK: Smashable rock (acts as WALL).

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- Quest Start: Turn 48900

## Strategy: Great Southern Surf Loop
The northern plateau (14, 10) is reached via the Western Corridor (X=0-2). Access to this corridor is only guaranteed at Row 51. To reach Row 51 without being blocked by ledges, Gem must Surf in the Outer Sea (X=24) and land at (23, 51).

## Execution Plan (Land Route: Great Southern Loop)
1. Move to (12, 34) and pass through the ledge gap. <- CURRENT TASK
2. Move to (18, 45) and pass through the Row 46 gap at (18, 46).
3. Move to (12, 47) and pass through the Row 48 gap at (12, 48).
4. Move to (10, 49) and pass through the Row 50 gap at (10, 50).
5. Walk West to (2, 51) and North along Western Corridor (X=2) to Row 12.
6. Walk East to (14, 12) and North to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

## Lessons Learned
- Land paths (X=4, X=6, X=8, X=12) are all blocked by ledges or walls before reaching the plateau.
- Row 15 ledge blocks all central/eastern access to the plateau.
- Row 51 is the only confirmed "bottom" thoroughfare.
- Ledge Gaps: (12, 34) is a rare gap allowing South movement past Row 34.

## Progress Summary
- Turn 49550: Closing Surf menu at (23, 32). Moving to (12, 34).
