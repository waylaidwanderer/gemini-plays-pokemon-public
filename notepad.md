# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement (acting as a ledge). Passable from SOUTH to NORTH.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at Row 15 (X=3-17).
- ROCK: Smashable rocks act as WALLs.
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
## Strategy: Great Southern Loop (v2)
Reach (14, 10) by bypassing all internal obstacles via the far southern and western corridors.
1. Move East to (12, 32) and South along X=12 to (12, 44).
2. Move West along Row 44 to (10, 44).
3. Move South along X=10 to (10, 51) (passing Ledge Gap at 10, 50).
4. Move West along Row 51 to (2, 51) (Western Corridor).
5. Move North along X=2 to (2, 12) (bypasses Row 15 ledge).
6. Move East along Row 12 to (14, 12) and North to (14, 10).

# Progress Notes
- Blocked: X=10 wall solid at Row 40.
- Blocked: X=9 wall solid at Row 34-36.
- Blocked: X=5 wall solid at Row 30-33.
- Blocked: X=3 wall solid at Row 23-29.
- Blocked: Row 15 ledge (X=3-17) blocks North.
- Verified: Row 44 is a clear horizontal path from X=12 to X=10.
- Verified: Row 51 is a clear horizontal path from X=10 to X=2.
- Verified: X=2 corridor is clear from Row 51 to Row 12.
