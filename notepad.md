# Gem's Log: Pok√©mon Yellow Legacy - Hard Mode

## I. Current Status & Active Plans

### A. Pok√©mon Party (Turn 2261)
1. SPARKY (PIKACHU): Lv12 (38/38 HP, EXP: 1728) | Moves: THUNDERSHOCK (30 PP), TAIL WHIP (30 PP), QUICK ATTACK (30 PP), THUNDER WAVE (20 PP) - AT LEVEL CAP (0 Badges)
2. SPROUT (ODDISH): Lv8 (27/27 HP, EXP: 374) | Moves: TACKLE (35 PP), POISONPOWDER (35 PP), LEECH SEED (10 PP)
3. PIP (PIDGEY): Lv8 (25/25 HP, EXP: 372) | Moves: GUST (32 PP), SAND-ATTACK (15 PP)

### B. Financial Status
- Money: ¬•296

### C. Current Location & Immediate Objective (Turn 2261)
- Location: Route 22 (ID: 33), at (32,12) in battle.
- Immediate Objective: Defeat wild SPEAROW, then continue training SPROUT (priority) and PIP on Route 22 and explore unseen tiles.

### D. Training Priorities
- SPROUT (ODDISH): Lv8 -> Needs significant training for Brock (Rock/Ground). Grass moves super effective. **PRIORITY**
- PIP (PIDGEY): Lv8 -> Needs training.
- SPARKY (PIKACHU): At cap, less effective vs Brock.

### E. Active Goals (for planning reference)
- **Primary Goal:** Defeat Brock and earn the Boulder Badge.
- **Secondary Goal:** Train SPROUT and PIP on Route 22 to prepare for Brock, and earn money.
- **Tertiary Goal:** Explore all 13 reachable unseen tiles on Route 22.

## II. Game Mechanics & Rules

### A. Hard Mode Rules
- Battle Style: Set.
- No items allowed in battle.
- Level caps: Pok√©mon cannot exceed cap for current badge count. (0 badges=12, 1=21, 2=24, 3=35, 4=43, 5=50, 6=53, 7=55, 8=65). EXP gain messages for capped Pok√©mon are visual only; no actual EXP is gained.

### B. General Game Changes (Pok√©mon Yellow Legacy)
- HMs: Forgettable, menu-use, not PC-storable. CUT is Bug-type.
- All 151 Pok√©mon obtainable. Trade evos by level.
- Smarter AI, tougher bosses, unlimited enemy PP.
- EXP. All obtainable without special requirements (seems active).

### C. Behavioral Guideline Summary (Internalized from Turn 2261 Critique)
- **Scientific Mindset:** Hypothesize, test, document failures (with attempt counts), avoid repeating failed strategies. Pivot goals if stalled.
- **Risk-Taking:** Be calculated, prioritize progression. Sacrifices okay in battle.
- **Wild Battles:** Run if capped/low HP/PP, unless catching/training. Speed dictates escape.
- **Nicknaming:** Always do it; enjoy the process.
- **Verification:** Trust direct observation over prior knowledge for ROM hack changes. Verify with multiple cases.

### D. Discovered Mechanics
- Poison: 1 HP lost per 4 steps outside battle.
- STAT Experience: Significant stat boosts from battling/leveling.
- PC Log Off: Saves game.
- Evolution: By training.
- Status Conditions: SLP (AWAKENING), BRN (BURN HEAL), PSN (ANTIDOTE), FRZ (ICE HEAL), PAR (PARLYZ HEAL).
- Wild Battle Escapes: Speed-dependent. If lead Pok√©mon's Speed >= wild's, escape is guaranteed. Otherwise, chance increases with attempts.
- Pok√©mon Nicknaming: Always do it when prompted.
- DV Checking: Hold START, then press A on STATS in Pok√©mon menu. (Learned from VIRIDIANCITY_YOUNGSTER2, Turn 1972)

## III. World Knowledge & Exploration

### A. Discovered Tile Types & Movement Rules
- **ground**: Walkable.
- **impassable**: Walls, objects, etc. Not traversable.
- **warp**: Map transition. Activation varies (instant 1x1, or 2-step for larger like exit mats/gatehouses).
- **water**: Requires Surf.
- **grass**: Wild encounters.
- **ledge**: Jump down only. One-way traversal.
- **cuttable**: Tree, requires CUT.
- **Pikachu Movement**: If Pikachu is adjacent in movement direction & player not facing him, 2 presses needed (1st turns, 2nd moves). Normal otherwise.
- **PC Interaction**: Stand below, face up, press A.
- **Item Interaction**: Some items require 'A' interaction.

## IV. Agent Management

### A. Defined Agents (Turn 2226+)
1.  `level_cap_compliance_checker`
2.  `item_finder_agent`
3.  `wkg_transition_recorder_agent` (Prompt updated Turn 2226 & 2261)
4.  `capability_checker_agent`
5.  `battle_strategist_agent`
6.  `pathfinding_agent` (Defined Turn 2226, Prompt updated Turn 2261 for ledges)
7.  `exploration_helper_agent` (Defined Turn 2226)

### B. Agent Performance Notes & Improvement Plans
- **`pathfinding_agent`:** Prompt updated (Turn 2261) to handle ledges correctly. Monitor performance.
- **`wkg_transition_recorder_agent`:** Prompt updated (Turn 2261) for better node handling/naming. Monitor performance, especially for existing nodes and `map_edge`.
- **`exploration_helper_agent`:** Untested. *PRIORITY TO USE* for Route 22 unseen tiles.
- **`capability_checker_agent`:** Untested. Seek opportunity to test.
- **`item_finder_agent`:** Untested. Prompt could be refined for building types.
- **`battle_strategist_agent`:** Untested.
- **General:** Ensure prompts for code-enabled agents clarify use of `run_code` for `map_xml_string` / `world_knowledge_graph_json_string`.

### C. Agent Development Ideas
- **Training Spot Suggester Agent:** Input: target Pok√©mon, current location, desired level. Output: suggested map/grass/trainers, considering types & enemy levels.
- **Shop Inventory Agent:** Input: city/mart name. Output: items sold & prices. (Requires discovery).

## V. Lessons Learned & Strategic Refinements

### A. Key Learnings from Mistakes
- **NPC Interaction Threshold:** If an NPC interaction fails after 2-3 distinct, well-reasoned attempts, assume they are non-battling, already defeated, or require a different game state, then MOVE ON. Do not get stuck in dialogue/interaction loops (e.g., Youngster1 Viridian, ~20 attempts).
- **Pathing Precision:** Meticulously review Map Memory before committing to movement. Verify current map_id/position from Game State frequently. Cross-reference agent paths with map data, especially for ledges.
- **Agent Reliability:** If an agent is unreliable (e.g., pathfinding over ledges), default to manual planning or `run_code` scripts. Review/fix failing agent prompts ASAP.
- **Flexibility:** Be willing to change secondary/tertiary goals if current approach is stalled. Don't fixate.
- **Map Segmentation by Ledges:** Understand that ledges create one-way paths and can isolate map sections. Different entry points to a route might be necessary to access all areas (e.g., Route 22 eastern vs. western sections).

### B. Failed Hypotheses Log (Selected)
- VIRIDIANCITY_YOUNGSTER1 (ID 1) at various Viridian locations: Attempted battle ~20+ times (Turns ~1920-1943) using A, B, Stun, Unstun, Menu, Movement. Result: Stuck dialogue loop. Conclusion: Interaction bugged or requires unknown condition. Marked üö´.
- Pathfinding on Route 22: `pathfinding_agent` (before prompt update) suggested going from (34,14) to (33,14) (Turn 2243, 2246), which is going *up* a ledge. Failed hypothesis: agent correctly handles ledges. Number of failed attempts with this agent path: 2.
