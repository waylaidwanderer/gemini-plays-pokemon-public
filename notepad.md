## Persistence Knowledge
### Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Traversable. Standard ground.
- WALL: Impassable.
- LADDER: Traversable. Vertical transition.
- WARP_CARPET: Map transition at edges.
- COUNTER: Interaction point; face it and press A.
- WATER: Requires SURF to traverse.
- LEDGE: One-way traversal (jump down).
- GRASS: Wild Pokémon encounter zone.
- WHIRLPOOL: Requires WHIRLPOOL to clear.
- WATERFALL: Requires WATERFALL to climb.
- ICE: Causes sliding movement until an obstacle is hit.
- HOLE: Pit that causes falling to a lower floor.

### Lessons Learned
- Gengar (Ghost): Immune to Normal moves (Return).
- Dragonite/Charizard (Ghost interaction): XENON is immune to Normal moves (Hyper Beam/Slash).
- Safeguard: Prevents status conditions for 5 turns. (Explains why Hypnosis failed on Dragonite).
- Outrage: User is locked for 2-3 turns, then becomes confused.
- Party Sub-menu (Battle): [SWITCH, STATS, CANCEL].
- Party Sub-menu (Overworld): [STATS, SWITCH, ITEM, CANCEL].
- HM Sub-menu logic: HM moves appear at top. SWITCH position varies.
- Status Management: Paralysis reduces speed by 75%.

## Battle Strategy
- Current Objective: Defeat Dragonite #3. Calcifer is the last one standing with 89 HP. Strategy: Use Thunderpunch (1 PP) or Return to secure the knockout while Dragonite is potentially confused from Outrage. Use battle_analyst to confirm highest damage output.
