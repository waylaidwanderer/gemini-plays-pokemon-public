# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Standard ground. Traversable.
- WATER: Surf required. Traversable.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- WALL: Impassable.
- DOOR: Warp point.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable cliff face. Blocks movement into the face (e.g., at 6, 34 blocks South).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
- BREAKABLE ROCK: Requires Rock Smash. Impassable.
- NPC: Impassable. Interact from adjacent tile.

# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The West Beach Land Route (Verified Row 28 Bridge)
- Plan:
  1. Select NO to Surf prompt at (12, 28). [IN PROGRESS]
  2. Walk West along Row 28 to (2, 28).
  3. Walk North along X=2 to Row 12.
  4. Walk East to (14, 12), then North to (14, 10).
- Status: At (12, 28), cancelling Surf.
- Reasoning: Row 28 is a confirmed FLOOR corridor from X=12 to X=2, bypassing all walls and buoys. This is the safest and most direct route.
