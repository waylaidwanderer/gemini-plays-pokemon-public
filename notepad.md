# Strategic Plan: Kanto Badges & Cinnabar Island
- **Strategy (The HOW):**
    1. Surf East from Cinnabar Island via Route 20 to reach Seafoam Islands.
    2. Locate the temporary Cinnabar Gym inside the Seafoam Islands cave.
    3. Defeat Gym Leader Blaine to earn the Volcano Badge.
    4. Collect remaining Kanto badges.
    5. Return to Viridian City to challenge Blue for the Earth Badge once all other badges are obtained.
    6. **Party Optimization:** Swap Snorlax into the party at the next available PC (replace ICARUS or LAPIS) as per strategist advice.
