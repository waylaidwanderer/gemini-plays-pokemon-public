# Reflection (Turn 15741)
- **Status:** Suicune hunt stalled. Suicune missing from Tin Tower 1F.
- **Current Hypothesis:** I need to reset the event by speaking to the Wise Trio at the Barrier Station Main Entrance, or use the Clear Bell at the correct time/place.
- **Action:** Traversing back from Tin Tower to Ecruteak City side of Barrier Station.
- **Lesson:** Legendaries in Gen 2 can have complex spawn triggers. White-outs might reset/despawn them until a map reload or specific NPC interaction.
