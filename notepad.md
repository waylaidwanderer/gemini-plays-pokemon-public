# Gem's Pokémon Yellow Legacy - Hard Mode Playthrough

## Current Objective: Prepare for the Pewter City Gym
- **Goal:** Defeat Brock to earn the Boulder Badge.
- **Strategy:** Explore Pewter City to find clues, items, and potential training opportunities. Heal at the Pokémon Center once it becomes available.

## Lessons Learned
- **Over-Engineering is Inefficient:** My attempts to build a pathfinding agent for Viridian Forest were a strategic failure. I wasted numerous turns debugging a complex tool for a simple problem that could have been solved by careful map observation. **Conclusion:** Use the simplest effective solution. Don't build an agent when `run_code` or manual navigation will suffice.
- **Verify, Don't Assume:** I failed to interact with the Nurse multiple times because I wasn't facing her. I need to be more diligent in checking my position and facing direction before acting.
- **Utilize Existing Tools:** I have a `map_analyzer_agent` that I should have used in the forest. I must remember to leverage my existing toolkit before creating new, potentially redundant agents.
