# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Navigation Notes
- **Strategy**: Underground Re-Do.
- **Status**: Inside Flower Shop (10_14). Listening to Lady's story.
- **Plan**: Press A to advance text.
- **Reasoning**: Text is not finished. She is talking about Prof Oak.
- **Timestamp**: Turn 8278.

### Key Locations
- **Sister's House**: (29, 5).
- **Flower Shop**: (19, 1). Needs Sudowoodo interaction.
- **Gym**: (24, 7).
- **Route 34 Exit**: South edge (Row 35).
- **Tracks**: West edge (Column 3-4).
- **Underground Entrances**: South at (11, 29), North presumably near Game Corner (9, 5).

### Quests
- **Sister's House**: (29, 5). The sister is missing (Route 36).
- **Route 35 Gatehouse**: East Side (x=31) is a dead end.
- **Plan**: Traverse Underground from South (11, 29) to North (9, 5). Exit and proceed to Route 35.
- **Reasoning**: Surface routes blocked. Underground is the only viable bypass.
- **Objective**: Reach North-West corner for Route 35.

### Status
- Badges: 3 (Zephyr, Hive, Plain).
- Party: Quilava (26), Sentret (2), Bellsprout (6), Togepi (5), Rattata (8).
- Route 34 Navigation: To reach the Daycare, travel North along the West path (main road) and enter the yard through the gap in the fence at (11, 15). Watch out for the Officer at (10, 16).
- Route 34 Item Ball at (7, 30) is blocked by a ledge at x=9 (One-way West->East?). Must approach from Goldenrod City/West side.
- Confirmed: Wall at x=35 blocks East access from Row 6-19.
- Tracks blocked at (3, 16) by Rude Tourist.
- Status: Returning to Underground (South Entrance).
- Plan: Go East to Main Road (x=18) -> South to Row 23 -> West to x=9 -> South to Row 29 -> Enter Underground (11, 29).
- Reasoning: Surface paths North (Main Road & Tracks) are blocked. Underground is the proven path to the North side.
- Note: Sandbox is down. Manual navigation active.
- **Transition**: Goldenrod (18, 35) connects to Route 34 (8, 0).
- **Plan**: Move West in Route 34 to finding the Tracks entrance (likely x=4 or lower).
