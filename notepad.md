    - Rocket Grunt (Route 24): Confessed to hiding the part.
    - **Location:** "Inside water put it I did. Look for in water center of GYM at."
  - **Plan:**
    1. Currently at (5, 6) facing Up.
    2. Check (5, 5) (Press A).
    3. If not found, check (4, 6) and (5, 6).
    4. Recover Machine Part.
    5. Return to Power Plant.
- Detour: Investigating an unmarked house at (28, 17) before heading East to Route 9.
- Note: Access to (28, 17) requires looping around the block via (24, 18).
- Police Station Investigation: The Pokefan F mentioned they were held up by robbers. Possible connection to the Power Plant commotion? Need to speak to the Chief (Fishing Guru sprite) for details.
- Plan: Resume travel to Route 9 via the Northern entrance at (27, 12).
- Police Chief (Fishing Guru sprite) says: "I heard that some shady character is skulking about. I won't stand for it if he turns out to be a thief."
- Hypothesis: This might trigger the Rocket Grunt's appearance in the Cerulean Gym.
- Plan: Check Cerulean Gym (30, 23) for the Grunt. If not there, proceed to Route 9.
- Police Chief confirmed a "shady character" is skulking about. This is likely the Rocket Grunt.
- Heading to Cerulean Gym (30, 23) to intercept him.
- Searched Cerulean Gym back walkway. No Rocket Grunt found.
- Conclusion: The Police Chief's hint is not enough. Must trigger the event at the Power Plant first.
- Plan: Exit Gym, head to Route 9 (via 27, 12), and proceed to the Power Plant.
    - Officer at (6, 12): "I just got word from CERULEAN." (Confirming the lead).
- Checked (5, 5) from (5, 6): No item.
- Plan: Move to Floor at (5, 7) to search (5, 6) and (4, 6) from the south.
- Moving Down to (5, 7), then facing Up to check (5, 6).
- Checked (5, 6) from (5, 7): No item.
- Checked (4, 6) from (4, 7): No item (Surf prompt).
- Plan:
  1. Check (4, 8) from (4, 7) facing Down.
  2. If empty, move to (5, 7) -> (5, 8).
  3. Check (4, 8) (Right side) and (6, 8) from (5, 8).
  4. Move to (5, 9), check (4, 9) and (6, 9).
  5. Loop to top bridge (Row 4) via (7, 7) -> (7, 4) path to check (4, 5).
- Checked (4, 8): Empty.
- Moving to North Bridge (Row 4) via East path (Column 7).
- Plan: Go to (4, 4) and (5, 4), face Down, check (4, 5) and (5, 5).
- Re-evaluating checks due to coordinate confusion.
- Currently at (5, 4) (North Bridge).
- Checking (5, 5) (Water) from the North.
- Next: Check (4, 5) from (4, 4).
- Checked (6, 5): No item (Surf prompt).
- Moving to (6, 7) to check (6, 6).
