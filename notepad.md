## II. Game Systems & Mechanics

### Tile Traversal Protocol
- **Testing Mandate:** When a new, reachable tile type is seen, I MUST test it immediately.
- **Movement Test:** Attempt to move *into* and *out of* the tile from all 4 cardinal directions to verify passability.
- **Ledge Test:** For any ledge-like tile, I must attempt to move up/against the apparent direction of the ledge to confirm if it is a one-way path.

### Verified Tile Types

## III. Key Items, HMs & TMs
*   **Key Items:** COIN CASE, SQUIRTBOTTLE (Used), GOOD ROD
*   **HMs:** HM01 (CUT), HM03 (SURF), HM04 (STRENGTH)
*   **TMs:** 
    * TM08 (ROCK SMASH)

## IV. Badges
*   **ZEPHYR BADGE**
*   **HIVE BADGE**
*   **PLAIN BADGE**
*   **FOG BADGE** (Allows use of SURF outside battle, makes Pokémon up to L50 obey)

## V. Blockades & Puzzles
*   **Olivine Lighthouse:** The stairs on 1F are non-functional. A sailor's dialogue implies the lighthouse beacon must be lit before I can proceed.
*   **Olivine City Sea Route:** I am currently unable to leave Olivine City by sea. Using SURF near the pier results in the animation playing, but the 'walking' state persists, preventing sea travel. This is likely related to the unlit lighthouse.

## VI. Current Travel Plan
*   **Objective:** Travel to Goldenrod City to solve the box puzzle in the underground using STRENGTH.
*   **Route:** Olivine City -> Route 39 -> Route 38 -> Ecruteak City -> Route 37 -> Route 36 -> National Park -> Route 35 -> Goldenrod City.
