# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
## Strategy: Western Corridor Land Route
Reach the northern plateau (14, 10) by weaving through wall gaps to the Western Corridor (X=0-2), which is the only land path past the Row 15 ledge.

## Execution Plan
1. Move West to (6, 33) via gap at (9, 33).
2. Move South to (6, 35) and West to (4, 35) via gap at (5, 35).
3. Move North to (4, 30) and West to (2, 30) via gap at (3, 30) - wait, (3, 30) is FLOOR.
4. Move North along Western Corridor (X=2) to Row 12.
5. Move East along Row 12 to (14, 12).
6. Move North to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.
