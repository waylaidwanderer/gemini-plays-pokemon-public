# Current Strategy: Return to Red
- **Timestamp:** Turn 26356 (Jan 7, 2026) [Silver Cave Outside]
- **Primary Goal:** Defeat Red.
- **Status:** At Waterfall base (11, 30).
- **Immediate Goal:** Ascend Waterfall at (11, 29).
- **Path:**
  1. Face Up and use Waterfall.
  2. Ascend to top.
  3. Surf NORTH to (11, 5).
- **Hypothesis:** Warp (11, 5) leads to Room 3 (Red).

# Failed Routes
- **Room 2 Right Landing (13, 21):** Leads to "Item Rooms Balcony" (Dead End).
- **Room 2 West Landing (5, 21):** Appeared empty (Double check?).

# Map Notes
- **Item Rooms:** Has a "Main" section with a North Hallway (Row 0) that is NOT accessible from the Balcony. Must find the entrance to this Main section.
- Waterfall Technique: To climb, one must be at the base facing UP. Simply pressing 'Up' into the waterfall causes a bump/slide-back that resets facing to DOWN.
- Solution: Move Down to (11, 31), then move Up to (11, 30). This lands the player at the base facing UP. Then press 'A'.
- Action: Executing Down-Up maneuver.
