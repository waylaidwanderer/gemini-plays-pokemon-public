3. Find the Director (5F/Basement).
4. Pass the quiz on 1F for the Radio Card.

- **Lesson (Input)**: Do NOT mix directional and action buttons in the same sequence.
- **Lesson (Sync)**: Always double-check turn numbers to avoid hallucination alerts.
- **Lesson (Strategy)**: If a floor is partitioned, look for an alternate staircase or warp on the floor below.
