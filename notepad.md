# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Stop Team Rocket.
- **Secondary Goal:** Investigate Radio Tower (Team Rocket takeover).
- **Navigation:** Go to Radio Tower (Northwest Goldenrod).
- **Status:** Navigating to West Goldenrod via South detour (y=28).
- **Plan:**
    1. Go East to x=18, then South to y=28 (crossing the city).
    2. Go West along y=28 to the West side (x=6).
    3. Go North along the West side to find the Radio Tower (Northwest).
    4. This avoids the walls blocking the middle of the city.
    5. Check the Radio Tower entrance for requirements.

## Key Information
- **Turn 12001:** Rocket Grunt at (31, 10) is a non-battling blocker.
- **Underground:** "No Entry" door at (18, 6) requires a key or switch.
- **Radio Tower:** Rumored to be taken over.

## Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR:** Standard walkable tile.
- **WALL:** Impassable.
- **COUNTER:** Impassable, interactable from adjacent.

## Reflections (Turn 12001)
- **Execution:** Good immediate responses.
- **Hygiene:** Notepad cleaned up. Grunt behavior noted.
- **Goals:** Clear outcome-focused goals.
- **Hypothesis:** Uniform is needed. If not on a Grunt, maybe it's in the locked room or with a specific NPC I missed.
