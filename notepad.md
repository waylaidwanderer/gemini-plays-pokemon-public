### Strategic Reflection (Turn 8719)
- **Status**: Stuck in Goldenrod for ~100 turns.
- **Issue**: Oscillating between East/West without clearing the "fog of war".
- **Insight**: The North-East (Flower Shop) is a cul-de-sac. The Central North Wall seems solid. The only remaining option is the North-West quadrant, which is largely "unseen".
- **Action Plan**: 
    1. Return to Main Street (y=10).
    2. Move West to x=6.
    3.Systematically explore North from there, hugging the West edge.

### Navigation Notes
- **Location**: Goldenrod City (Radio Tower Area).
- **Goal**: Reach Far West Edge (x=0).
- **Status**: Bypassing NPC at (4, 16) via Row 18.
- **Path**: (5, 16) -> South to (5, 18) -> West to (3, 18) -> North to (3, 16).
- **Hypothesis**: The column at x=3 or a path further West (x=0) leads North to Route 35.

### Quest Chain: SquirtBottle
1. **Defeat Whitney**: Done (Plain Badge obtained).
2. **Find Floria**: Currently seeking at Route 36.
3. **Get Bottle**: Return to Flower Shop after meeting Floria.

### Key Locations
- **NPC Block**: (4, 16).
- **Bypass Path**: (3, 18).
- **Potential Exit**: x=0-3 corridor.
