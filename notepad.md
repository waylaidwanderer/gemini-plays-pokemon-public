# Game Mechanics & Lessons

## Agent Development & Tactics
- **Hypothesis:** The `master_pathfinder_agent` needs debugging to handle complex cave layouts. I will test it again in a controlled environment before relying on it for critical navigation.
- Battle tactics need to be more proactive. I will not wait until a Pok√©mon's HP is critical before using priority moves like Quick Attack.

## Battle Notes
- If running from a wild battle fails more than twice, it is more efficient to defeat the opponent (e.g., failed to run from Geodude 3 times in Mt. Moon).
