# Strategy: Trigger Suicune Sighting (Started: Turn 51131)
- City Logic: Vertical walls divide the city into corridors. The Western Corridor (X=2) is the primary land route to the north, bypassing major obstacles. Row 12 is a horizontal corridor that connects the Western Corridor to the sighting spot at (14, 10).
- Execution Plan:
  1. Navigate to (2, 34) via the gap south of the Photo Studio.
  2. Walk North to (2, 12).
  3. Walk East to (14, 12) and North to (14, 10).
- Battle Prep: Lead Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion).

# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard traversable tile.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable collision.
- WATER: Traversable only while using SURF.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way passage (South only).
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way passage (North only). Also known as terraces.
- ROCK (Object): Impassable until cleared with ROCK SMASH.
