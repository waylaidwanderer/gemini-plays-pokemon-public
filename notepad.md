# Global Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard traversable tile.
- WALL / TREE / MOUNTAIN / HEADBUTT_TREE: Impassable collision.
- WATER: Requires Surf (HM03) to traverse. Interact with water edge or use from menu.
- CUT_TREE: Requires Cut (HM01) to clear. Impassable otherwise. Regrows whenever the map is reloaded (e.g., entering/exiting Mount Mortar).
- LEDGE: One-way jump (usually South). Cannot be jumped from below.
- TALL_GRASS: Traversable, but triggers wild Pokemon encounters.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Special collision at (50, 14), impassable when moving North.

# Suicune Capture Strategy (Pokemon Crystal)
## Primary Goal: Trigger Suicune Sightings
- Suicune follows a scripted sequence of overworld sightings in Crystal.
- Sighting 1: North of Cianwood City (Completed).
- Sighting 2: Route 42 Middle Island (Current Target). Triggered by approaching the sprite on the island floor.
- Sighting 3: Route 36 (Next Target). Triggered by approaching the sprite near the Sudowoodo spot.
- Final Encounter: Tin Tower. Stationary battle.

## Route 42 Middle Island Sweep Plan
- I have walked on most tiles in the northern and central parts of the island clearing.
- I need to walk on the tiles south of the fruit trees: (26, 17), (27, 17), (28, 17), (29, 17), (30, 17).
- Also check (26, 16) and (30, 16).

## Party Strategy
- XENON (Gastly, Lv18): Mean Look and Hypnosis. 
- KIMCHI (Gloom): Cut.
- Ravioli (Krabby): Surf.

## Items
- Super Repel: Active. Use to avoid wild encounters while exploring.
