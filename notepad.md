### Objectives
1. **Primary**: Go to Route 34 (South).
2. **Secondary**: Get SquirtBottle.
3. **Tertiary**: Find Route 35 Gatehouse (North).

### Navigation Notes (Goldenrod)
- **North Exit Puzzle**: The path to Route 35 is blocked by complex walls.
  - **Center (Flower Shop)**: Blocked at Row 1.
  - **West (Radio Tower)**: Dead end.
  - **East (Gym)**: Blocked at Row 6-19.
  - **Far East**: Need to find a crossover point. Row 5 looks promising but access is tricky.
- **Strategy**: Exiting South to Route 34 first.

### Key Locations
- **Flower Shop**: (19, 1). Needs Sudowoodo interaction.
- **Route 34 Exit**: South edge of map (Row 35).

### Quests
- **Route 35 Gatehouse**: Deliver Mail (Randy).
- **Sudowoodo**: Route 36 (North).

### Status
- Badges: 3 (Zephyr, Hive, Plain).
- Party: Quilava (26), Sentret (2), Bellsprout (6), Togepi (5), Rattata (8).
- Fence Analysis: The fence/ledge separates me (West) from the Daycare (East). The Daycare is at Y=15, but I am at Y=25. I must head South to Y=32 to find a gap/path to loop back North.
- Route 34 Navigation: The East side (Tall Grass) is the correct path North to the Daycare. The West side is blocked by ledges and leads to a dead end.
