# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The Buoy Maze Master Path (Step-by-Step)
- Plan:
  1. Surf at (19, 30) -> (20, 30). [DONE]
  2. Navigate North to (27, 10) via the main channel (X=27).
  3. West through Gap 1 (26, 10) to (23, 10).
  4. South to (23, 14), then West through Gap 4 (19, 14).
  5. North to (19, 11), then West to (16, 11) and land.
  6. Walk to (14, 10).
- Status: At (19, 30) surfing, clearing message.
- Reasoning: Row 15 is a continuous wall of cliffs and buoys from X=6 to X=22. The only gap is at (23, 15). Once past it, Row 14 and Row 11 provide a path to the northern plateau landing spot.
