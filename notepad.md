# Strategy: Rising Badge (Gym Leader Clair)
- Level Target: Xenon and Kimchi to Lv40.
- Tactical Plan: Lead with Xenon (Ghost; immune to Selfdestruct). Night Shade for fixed damage. Gneiss/Calcifer as finishers.
- Preparation: Stock up on Full Heals. Prepare status/counters for Kingdra.

# Strategy: Exp. Share Acquisition (Current)
- Goal: Trade Red Scale for Exp. Share at Mr. Pokemon's House (17, 5).
- Route: (2, 39) -> (2, 41) -> (13, 41) -> (13, 30) -> (15, 30) -> (15, 20) -> (17, 20) -> (17, 18) -> (18, 18) -> (18, 14) -> (17, 14) -> (17, 6) -> (17, 5).
- Note: Avoid ledges at (2, 37) by detouring through the right side of the map.

# Strategy: Johto League Training
- Method: Switch-training. Lead with Xenon (Safety), then switch to finisher (Gneiss/Calcifer).
- Spot: Route 45 grass (4, 12).
- Resource Management: Fly to Blackthorn PC to heal.

# Ground-Type Safety Protocol
- Problem: Xenon is weak to Ground (Magnitude/Earthquake).
- Solution: NEVER switch Xenon into suspected Ground-type users. Use Icarus/Gneiss instead.

# Progress Tracker
- Kimchi (Gloom): Lv28 (17615 EXP).
- Xenon (Haunter): Lv29 (20309 EXP).

# Key Locations & Gifts
- Mr. Pokemon: Route 30 (17, 5).
- Dana (Lass): Route 38. Has a gift.
- Chad (Schoolboy): Route 38. Wants to battle.
- Dark Cave Entrance: Route 45 (2, 5).

# Area Mechanics: Route 30
- TALL_GRASS: Traversable, triggers wild encounters.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump South. Blocked from moving North.
- Navigating North: Must detour around ledges using gaps in rocks/trees (e.g., heading right through grass at (13, 41)).

# Lessons Learned
- HP/PP Verification: Always use Game State Information to confirm current party health and status. Do not rely on memory or duration of training.
- Quest Tracking: Exp. Share quest started Turn #31846.
