# Strategic Notes
## Objectives
- **Primary:** Reach Indigo Plateau (Money Farming Loop).
- **Secondary:** Defeat Elite Four.
- **Tertiary:** Hunt Roamers (Raikou/Entei) - *Paused*.

## Current Task: Defeat Elite Four
- **Location:** Indigo Plateau - Will's Room (16_3) -> Koga's Room.
- **Goal:** Defeat Koga (Poison Type).
- **Status:** Will Defeated.
- **Strategy for Koga:**
  - **Lead:** Muscle (Lv86).
  - **Ariados/Venomoth:** `Thunderpunch` or `Strength` (Neutral).
  - **Forretress:** `Thunderpunch` (Neutral). Avoid Physical contact if possible? No, Thunderpunch is contact. Fire is best but I lack strong Fire. Muscle's high level should power through.
  - **Muk:** `Strength` (Neutral) or `Earthquake` if taught. (Currently: Strength).
  - **Crobat:** `Ice Punch` or `Thunderpunch` (Super Effective).
  - **Plan:** Muscle sweeps. Heal if Poisoned/Confused.
- **Next Steps:**
  1. Move to Koga's Room.
  2. Switch Muscle to Lead (Slot 1).
  3. Save?
