# Suicune Capture Strategy (Crystal Version)
## Primary Goal: Capture Suicune
- Step 1: Obtain Clear Bell. (COMPLETE)
- Step 2: Access Tin Tower. Defeat the Wise Trio. (COMPLETE)
- Step 3: Encounter Suicune at Tin Tower. (COMPLETE - It fled).
- Step 4: Track Suicune. Use Pokédex. (Started Turn 14853).
- Step 5: Prepare Catcher. XENON (Gastly) is the primary trainee for trapping (Mean Look + Hypnosis). Parasect is a secondary goal for False Swipe.

## Capture Contingency & Roamer Mechanics
- Roamers (Suicune, Raikou, Entei) move between adjacent maps whenever the player crosses a map boundary.
- Interception Strategy: Identify the roamer's current map via Pokédex. Stay on that map and pace in grass/water. Do not cross map boundaries while hunting.
- Map Connections (Route 42): Ecruteak City (1_1), Mahogany Town (2_1), Mt. Mortar (3_1).
- Battle Contingency: If Gastly (XENON) faints, use ICARUS or Calcifer. Mean Look is required to prevent immediate fleeing. If Suicune flees, check Pokedex immediately.
