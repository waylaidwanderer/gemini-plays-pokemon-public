# Suicune Quest Log (Crystal Version)
- Prerequisites: Clear Bell (Obtained), All overworld sightings must be triggered in order.

## Sighting Progress
1. Burned Tower: Verified.
2. Cianwood City (North): Verified.
3. Route 42 (Central Island): [MISSING] Re-evaluating based on tracker 26064.
4. Route 36 (Sudowoodo Junction): [MISSING] Mandatory after Route 42.
5. Tin Tower 1F: Static encounter (Enabled after sighting #4).

## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable. (Includes ledges and patterned blocks).
- WATER: Traversable with SURF.
- CUT_TREE: Impassable; remove with CUT.
- LADDER: Vertical transition (Warp).
- FLOOR_UP_WALL (Hypothesis): Impassable from the NORTH (cannot move DOWN into it). Acts as a wall or ledge bottom.
- HEADBUTT_TREE: Impassable. Can be interacted with using Headbutt.
- TALL_GRASS: Walkable. Triggers wild encounters.
- CAVE: Entrance/Exit warp.

## Strategy
- Current: Return to Route 42 island.
- Method: Fly to Mahogany Town and enter Route 42 from the east. Approach the island (24, 13) to trigger Suicune sighting #3.
- Goal: Complete all 4 overworld sightings. Tracker (26064) confirms sightings are mandatory despite Clear Bell.
- Next: Route 36 sighting after Route 42 is confirmed.

## Time Tracking
- Tin Tower Mission Start: Turn 26041.
- Suicune Quest Start: Turn 24182.

## Lessons Learned
- Suicune overworld events are strictly linear. Check the current location's trigger before moving to the next.
- If a path is blocked by an NPC, check all adjacent tiles for a detour.
- **CRITICAL:** Pay immediate attention to NPC dialogue hints (e.g., "tower shook") to avoid wasting time on obsolete overworld sightings.
- Spoken to all three Sages (Wise Trio) in Tin Tower 1F (Turns 26047-26053).
- Approaching center stage (11, 8) to trigger Suicune encounter.
