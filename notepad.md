# Suicune Capture Strategy (The "How")
- Goal: Capture Suicune (Lv 40, Water).
- Status: Suicune (Lv 40) HP in RED (~5-10%), Accuracy -6.
- Strategy: Tank with GNEISS (Water weakness offset by Suicune's -6 accuracy) and throw Great Balls.
- Hypothesis: Current capture rate with Great Balls at low HP and no status is low but feasible. Persistence is the primary method as status-capable Pokemon are fainted.
- Failed Attempts: ~125 turns of throwing balls at low HP.
