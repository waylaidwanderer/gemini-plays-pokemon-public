# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
- **Start Turn:** 49885
- **Current Status:** Heading to the eastern shore (23, 33) to start the Ocean Loop.

## Active Strategy: The Ocean Loop
The northern plateau (14, 10) is accessible via the western coastal highway (X=2). To reach X=2, we bypass the island's elevation traps by surfing south through the eastern ocean to the southern clearway (Row 51).

### Execution Plan
1. Eastern Shore: Walk to (23, 33). (In Progress)
2. Ocean Entry: Face Right and use SURF (GORP).
3. Sea Transit: Surf South to (24, 51).
4. Southern Traverse: Walk West along Row 51 to (2, 51).
5. Coastal Highway: Walk North along X=2 to Row 12.
6. Final Approach: Walk East to (14, 12) and North to Suicune at (14, 10).

## Verified Mechanics
- Row 33: Clear land path from X=12 to X=23 (bypass Pokefan M at X=16).
- Row 51: Completely clear land bridge from X=2 to X=24.
- X=2 Highway: Clear land corridor from Row 51 to Row 12.

## Battle Plan: Eusine
- Expected Team: Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25).
- Lead: Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion).
- Strategy: Flamethrower sweep.

## Failed Hypotheses
- Hypothesis 1: Land access via central gaps (blocked by one-way traps).
- Hypothesis 2: Direct Surf to beach (dead end).
- Hypothesis 3: Cut tree at (11, 13) (fake tree).
