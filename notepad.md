# Suicune Capture Strategy
## Strategy: The Mean Look Pivot
1. Catch a Gastly in Sprout Tower (Night only, Lv 3-6).
2. Train Gastly to Lv 13 to learn Mean Look.
3. Evolve to Haunter (Lv 25) to ensure Base 95 Speed (Suicune is Base 85).
4. Track Suicune using Pokedex AREA map.
5. Lead with Haunter: Mean Look (Turn 1) -> Hypnosis -> Great Balls.

## Global Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard traversable tile.
- TALL_GRASS: Standard encounter tile.
- WALL/HEADBUTT_TREE: Impassable.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT: Jumpable one-way movement.
- WARP_CARPET_RIGHT/DOWN: Map transition.
- WATER: Traversable with HM SURF.
- ICE: Sliding movement.
- COUNTER: Interaction point for NPCs; impassable.
- LADDER: Vertical map transition; traversable.
- NPC: Map objects that block movement.

## Sprout Tower Analysis
- Layout: Middle section (x=5 to x=14) is isolated. Access outer ring via 2F ladders.
- Encounters: FLOOR tiles at (14, 6), (10, 11), and (14, 10) are safe zones. (6, 5) on 2F is a valid encounter tile.
- Sweet Scent: Triggers immediate encounters on valid tiles. "Nothing here" means safe tile.

## Training Plan: XENON
- Retrieve XENON from Bill's PC.
- Deposit Blarney (Sudowoodo) to make room.
- Heal party at Violet Pokecenter.
- Train XENON to Lv 13 (Mean Look) and then to Lv 25 (Haunter).
- Grind Start: Turn #13980.

## Route 32 Observations
- Ledge at (14, 6): Jumpable south.
