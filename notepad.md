- Sequence: 1. Burned Tower (Done) -> 2. Cianwood (Done) -> 3. Route 42 Island (Current) -> 4. Route 36 -> 5. Route 14 -> 7. Tin Tower 1F.

- Sighting 3 Strategy: Approach (26, 14) on Route 42 island from the south after cutting the tree at (24, 13).
- Battle Strategy (Tin Tower): Lead XENON (GASTLY). Use MEAN LOOK, HYPNOSIS, NIGHT SHADE.
- Insight: Pokedex AREA map dots are Raikou/Entei roamers. Suicune is STATIONARY until after the scripted sequence ends.
