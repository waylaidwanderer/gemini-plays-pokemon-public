# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Verified Strategy: The Terrace Climb
The northern plateau (14, 10) is accessible via a series of one-way "upward" transitions that bypass the ledge system. This is a pure land route.

### Execution Plan
1. Central Passage: Walk West from (23, 33) to (6, 35). (In Progress)
2. First Climb: Move North through (6, 34) [UP_WALL] to reach Row 33.
3. Second Climb: Walk to (4, 31) and move North through (4, 30) [UP_WALL] to reach Row 29.
4. Third Climb: Walk to (4, 21) and move North through (4, 20) [UP_WALL] to reach Row 19.
5. Plateau Entry: Walk to (4, 14), then East to (8, 14), then North to (8, 12).
6. Final Approach: Walk East along Row 12 to (14, 12) and North to Suicune at (14, 10).

## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Land (Traversable).
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way North. Blocks DOWN movement (e.g., (6, 34), (4, 30), (4, 20)).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way South. Blocks NORTH movement (e.g., (10, 15)).

## Battle Plan: Eusine
- Expected Team: Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25).
- Lead: Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion). Strategy: Flamethrower sweep.

## Hallucination Correction
- Previous claim that the plateau is "inaccessible from land" was incorrect. The UP_WALL tiles are traversable from the South, providing a valid path.
