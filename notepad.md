# Strategy Lessons
- Buoy Maze: The buoy spiral is a trap designed to block access from the east. The landing spot (14, 10) is only reachable via the western channel or a very specific path through the inner buoys.
- Land Route Efficiency: When water navigation is complex, look for land-based corridors (like X=2) that bypass the obstacles.
- Menu Discipline: Slow down during menu navigation to avoid entering Options or Pokemon stats accidentally. Verify the cursor position before pressing A.

# Suicune Quest Strategy: 'The Buoy Spiral to North Plateau'
- Observation: The north plateau at (7, 4) is isolated by walls and ledges. The only access is by water from the north-east, navigating a spiral of buoy walls.
- Route:
    1. Surf at (27, 44) onto (28, 44).
    2. Sail North to (28, 10), then Left past X=26 (Gap 1 at Y=10+).
    3. Sail South to (26, 16), then Left past X=22 (Gap 2 at Y=16).
    4. Sail Left to (21, 16), then North to (21, 14).
    5. Sail Left past X=19 (Gap 3 at Y=14).
    6. Sail North to (19, 11), then Left past X=17 (Wall 7 ends at Y=12).
    7. Land at (14, 10) or (16, 11).
    8. Walk to Suicune at (7, 4).
- Preparation: Lead with XENON (Haunter) for Hypnosis. Use SUPER REPEL.
