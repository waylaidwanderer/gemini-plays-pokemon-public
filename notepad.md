## Strategy: Terrestrial Zig-Zag to Suicune
**Start Turn:** 48900 (Quest: Trigger Suicune Overworld Sighting)

3. Walk West to (8, 44), bypassing the X=9 wall.
4. Walk South to (8, 48).
5. Walk West to (6, 48), bypassing the X=7 wall.
6. Walk North to (6, 35), bypassing the FLOOR_UP_WALL at (6, 46) (UP is OK).
7. Walk West to (2, 35), bypassing the X=5 wall.
8. Walk North along the West Beach Highway (X=2) to (2, 14).
9. Walk East to (8, 14), then North to (8, 12).
