# I. Active Quests & Investigation Logs

## Main Quest: The Enigmatic Old Amber
- **Objective:** Retrieve the Old Amber.
- **Location:** Pewter Museum of Science.
- **Obstacle:** A Scientist at (13, 5) on 1F blocks the path to an item.
- **Status:** Stalled. All hypotheses tested in Pewter City have failed. The solution may lie outside of Pewter City.

### Confirmed Puzzle Steps (Internal Museum Sequence)
1. Lead with a Geodude or a revived fossil Pokémon (Omanyte, Aerodactyl) and speak to the Old Man at (2, 5) on 1F.
2. Speak to the Scientist at (8, 6) on 2F, who mentions the space exhibit.
3. Interact with the Kabutops Fossil at (3, 7) on 1F.

### Consolidated Failed Hypotheses
- **Internal Museum Actions:**
    - Solving the full puzzle sequence with Geodude, Omanyte, or Aerodactyl in the lead does not move the blocking scientist.
    - Triggering the Aerodactyl fossil trap and then immediately interacting with the Pikachu at (4, 5) does not move the blocking scientist.
    - Interacting with the Aerodactyl Fossil at (3, 4) and then immediately speaking to the Old Man at (2, 5) changes his dialogue but does not move the blocking scientist.
    - Interacting with the Aerodactyl & Kabutops Fossils in immediate succession does not move the blocking scientist; both simply trigger traps.
    - Leading with a Pikachu and interacting with the NPC Pikachu at (1, 6) does not trigger a special event; it is another trap.
    - Triggering both the Aerodactyl Fossil trap (3, 4) and the Kabutops Fossil trap (3, 7) and then speaking to the Gambler (2, 5) yields no new dialogue.
    - After resetting the museum state, triggering *only* the Kabutops Fossil trap at (3, 7) and then speaking to the Gambler at (2, 5) yields no new dialogue.
    - Using the Coin Case while facing the Gambler at (2, 5) yielded no new dialogue or event.
- **External Pewter City Actions:**
    - Re-checking dialogue with the Old Man at (2, 5) after completing all puzzle steps yields no new dialogue.
    - After completing the internal museum puzzle sequence, speaking to the Super Nerd at (28, 18) in Pewter City yielded no new dialogue or progress.
    - Interviewing all NPCs in Pewter City provided no new clues for the museum puzzle.
    - Interacting with the NPC Pikachu at (27, 26) in Pewter City did not move the blocking scientist inside the museum. (Agent Hypothesis #1 FAILED)
    - Leading with a revived Aerodactyl and speaking to the Super Nerd at (28, 18) in Pewter City changed his dialogue but did not move the blocking scientist. (Agent Hypothesis #2 FAILED)
    - Speaking to the second Super Nerd (PEWTERCITY_SUPER_NERD2) at (30, 26) yielded the same generic dialogue. (Agent Hypothesis #3 FAILED)
    - Reading the museum sign at (16, 10) and then immediately speaking to the Super Nerd at (28, 18) yielded no new dialogue. (Agent Hypothesis #4 FAILED)
    - Having the player's Pikachu interact with the NPC Pikachu at (27, 17) yielded no new dialogue or event. (Agent Hypothesis #5 FAILED)

## Main Quest: The Ghost of Lavender Town
- **Objective:** Investigate the strange occurrences in POKéMON TOWER.
- **Status:** In Progress. Investigation of the tower is complete. Next step is to speak with Mr. Fuji.
- **Key Finding:** The SILPH SCOPE is required to unmask the GHOSTs. I possess this item.
- **Clue:** A Little Girl in the Pokémon Center mentioned that CUBONE's mother was killed by TEAM ROCKET.

# II. Key Discoveries & Lessons Learned
- **Critical Directive Failure - Deferral of Tasks (CRITICAL):** I have repeatedly deferred critical maintenance tasks. **Lesson Reinforced:** All maintenance and data management tasks are the absolute highest priority and MUST be performed successfully in the current turn.
- **Game Corner Entry Failure (CRITICAL):** Became stuck in a loop attempting to enter the Celadon Game Corner. **Lesson:** If a specific path is repeatedly blocked, do not persist. Re-evaluate, check for alternate routes, or pivot to a different high-priority goal.
- **Puzzle State Persistence:** Leaving and re-entering the Pewter Museum does **not** reset the internal puzzle state.
- **Confirmation Bias:** I exhibited confirmation bias with the 'Meowth' hypothesis and the belief that the museum puzzle solution was inside the museum. **Lesson:** I must be more willing to abandon a hypothesis quickly when it yields no results and actively try to disprove my own assumptions.

# III. Game Mechanics (Observed)
- **Post-Battle Position Shift:** Sometimes, after a wild battle concludes, the player's character may be moved to a different, nearby tile.
- **Ghost-type Damage:** Ghost-type moves deal SPECIAL damage, not physical.
- **Purified Zone:** A specific tile area in the Pokémon Tower (5F) that fully heals the party upon entry.

# IV. Pokemon Locations (Observed)
- **Route 8:** Growlithe, Abra, Pidgey, Rattata, Jigglypuff, Vulpix
- **Route 7:** Pidgey, Vulpix, Koffing, Jigglypuff

# V. Tool & Agent Improvement Log
- **select_battle_move (FIXED):** The tool has been updated. In-game testing confirmed the battle menu is a single vertical list, not a 2x2 grid.
- **pokemon_hunter (FIXED):** The tool has been refactored to accept a rectangular boundary to ensure all generated movements stay within a specified hunting area.
- **exploration_planner (NEW):** Created an agent to generate optimal routes for speaking to all unvisited NPCs in a city.

# VI. New Directives & Resolutions
- **Map Marker Discipline (WARPS):** I must mark every warp tile (both entry and exit) with '🚪' immediately after using it to improve my navigational memory and avoid getting lost in complex areas.

# VII. Archived Discoveries & Confirmations
