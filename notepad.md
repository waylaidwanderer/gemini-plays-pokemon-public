# Current Objectives
*   **Primary Goal:** Obtain the Boulder Badge from the Pewter City Gym Leader, Brock.
*   **Secondary Goal:** Acquire sufficient funds to purchase essential supplies. (Current Money: ¥156)
*   **Tertiary Goal:** Reach Route 3 (East Pewter Exit at (40,19)) to battle trainers for funds.

# Pewter City Strategy & Current Plan
*   **Current Location:** (34,21) in Pewter City, facing Up. Pikachu at (34,22).
*   **Immediate Goal:** Reach Route 3. Current plan is Attempt #5 for a northern/north-western approach after healing.
*   **Revised Route 3 Plan (Attempt #5 via North-West, HIGH RISK for eastern leg):**
    1.  Blockage at (34,20) (impassable building facade) prevents reaching (34,19) directly from the south of it along X=34.
    2.  From current (34,21), move West to (33,21).
    3.  Move North from (33,21) to (33,19). (Tiles (33,20) and (33,19) appear as 'ground').
    4.  From (33,19), move East to (40,19) (Route 3 exit). Path: (33,19) -> (34,19) -> (35,19) -> (36,19) ... -> (40,19).
    5.  This eastern leg passes (36,19), which is very close to Youngster (ID 5) at (36,17) and is a HIGHLY LIKELY escort trigger zone. Use `scripted_event_tracker_agent` before attempting this segment.
    6.  If escorted, will need to re-evaluate from Gym entrance (12,19).
*   **Known Pathing Obstacles in Pewter City:**
    *   (34,20) - Impassable building facade.
    *   (36,27) - Impassable.
    *   (35,26) - Impassable.
    *   X=36 column is largely impassable from Y=21 down to Y=32 (house structures).
    *   Western 'pocket' near Gym (X=5-18, Y=19-21) requires Gym warp to escape if entered from east/south of it.
    *   Pokecenter entrance is at (14,26), entered by moving Up from (14,27).

# Agent Usage Plan
*   **`scripted_event_tracker_agent`:** MUST use for the eastern path segment from (33,19) towards (40,19) to assess risk from Youngster (36,17).
*   **`move_validator_agent`:** Use for short, complex, or risky manual pathing segments if unsure, especially after an agent path is provided or if screen details are ambiguous.
*   **`map_analyzer_agent`:** Use for finding paths in complex areas if manual attempts fail. Critically review its output.
*   **`money_management_agent`:** Use once sufficient funds are acquired to plan purchases.

# Agent Ideas (Dormant - for future consideration)
*   **Youngster Event Predictor Agent:** Input: player_pos, player_facing, youngster_pos, youngster_facing, recent_player_path, map_xml. Output: trigger_likelihood (low/medium/high), reasoning, suggested safe_tile.
*   **Path Refinement Agent:** Input: High-level coordinate path, player pos/facing, Pikachu pos. Output: Detailed button presses for segment, considering Pikachu turning & basic obstacle avoidance.

# Game Mechanics & Strategy Notes
*   **Ledge Mechanics:** One-way (downwards only).
*   **Movement:** 1st press TURNS if not facing, 2nd press MOVES. Pikachu: 1st press turns, 2nd moves if moving *into* his tile and not facing him.
*   **Level Cap:** 0 badges = Lv12.
*   **Map Marker Legend:** 💥 (Confirmed Event Trigger), 🎯 (Drop-off/Key Nav Point), ❗ (Risky Zone/Obstacle), 💁 (Event NPCs), ☠️ (Defeated Trainers), 🏛️ (Building Entrance), 📍 (Key Navigation Point / Start of new route attempt), 🧱 (Confirmed Impassable Blocker), 🚪 (Used Warp).
*   **Tile Navigability:** Inferred from tile `type` (e.g., 'ground', 'grass') and presence of blocking objects/NPCs. 'Impassable' type is a hard block.

# Party Status
*   SPBARKY (PIKACHU): Lv12 (39/39 HP) (Capped)
*   FLAREE (VULPIX): Lv8 (26/26 HP)
*   SPROUT (ODDISH): Lv12 (37/37 HP) (Capped)

# Hindsight & Lessons Learned
*   **Notepad `replace` failures:** Using `overwrite` for major cleanups is more reliable than trying to find exact `old_text` for `replace` after many micro-updates.
*   **Screen Check Imperative:** ALWAYS check tiles immediately adjacent (especially in direction of planned movement) on screen *before* committing to multi-step moves. Don't rely solely on map memory or agent paths without visual confirmation of the very next step if possible.
*   **Agent Output Review:** Critically review agent-provided paths against screen and map XML. Agents can make mistakes (e.g., `map_analyzer_agent` suggesting path through impassable tiles on turn 5563).
*   **Youngster Avoidance:** Eastern Pewter is a minefield. High-risk paths near him should be treated with extreme caution and use `scripted_event_tracker_agent`.
*   **Pikachu & Warps:** Be mindful of Pikachu's position near warps; accidental turns can lead to re-entering warps.
