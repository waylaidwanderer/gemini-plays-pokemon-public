# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Verified Strategy: The North Sea Loop
The northern plateau (14, 10) is accessible via the western coastal highway (X=2). Since all land routes and southern water routes are blocked by elevation traps, we must loop around the island through Route 41.

### Execution Plan
1. Eastern Shore: Walk to (23, 33). (Done)
2. Ocean Entry: Face Right and use SURF (GORP). (In Progress)
3. North Sea Transit: Surf North to Row 0 to enter Route 41. 
4. Western Bypass: Surf West in Route 41 to X=2, then South back into Cianwood City.
5. Final Dash: Walk South along X=2 to Row 10, then East to (14, 10).

## Verified Mechanics
- Route 41 Transition: Row 0 X=23-25 is WATER, allowing map transition.
- X=2 Highway: Clear land path from Row 0 to Row 10.

## Battle Plan: Eusine
- Expected Team: Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25).
- Lead: Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion). Strategy: Flamethrower sweep.

## Failed Hypotheses Archive
- Hypothesis 1: Land access via central gaps (blocked by one-way traps).
- Hypothesis 2: Direct Surf to beach (dead end).
- Hypothesis 3: Cut tree at (11, 13) (fake tree).
- Hypothesis 4: Southern Loop via Row 51 (blocked by Row 50 traps).
- Hypothesis 5: Terrace Loop (blocked by Row 31/30 walls).
