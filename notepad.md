# Suicune Capture Strategy
- Lead: XENON (Haunter, Lv44).
- Move 1: Hypnosis (Sleep). Accuracy is key.
- Move 2: Night Shade (44 dmg). Suicune (Lv40) has ~120 HP. Use twice for Red health.
- Move 3: Dream Eater (100 power). Only works if Suicune is asleep.
- Item: Ultra Balls (32).

- Step 2: Surf to Outer Channel (X=27) and enter Gap 1 at (26, 10). (In Progress)
- Step 3: Navigate Middle Ring to Gap 2 at (22, 16).
- Step 4: Navigate Inner Ring to Gap 3 at (19, 14).
- Step 5: Navigate Center Area to Landing Point at (16, 11).
- Step 6: Walk to Sighting Spot at (14, 10).

# Lessons Learned
- Pathing: The city center is a plateau; land routes to the west/north beaches are blocked by cliffs. Surf via the east coast is the primary route.
- Navigation: The "Great Spiral" buoy maze is the only aquatic path to the North Plateau.
- Blockage: (7, 45) is a Gym Sign (WALL). (5, 44) is a WALL.
