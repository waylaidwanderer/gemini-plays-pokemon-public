- LAPIS (POLIWAG): Lv12 (Waterfall, Surf, Whirlpool)

# Tile Mechanics
- WATER: Traversable only via Surf.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- FLOOR: Standard walkable ground.
- WALL: Impassable obstacle.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Represents a ledge face. Impassable from the SOUTH (cannot walk north). Behaves as FLOOR from other directions.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump from NORTH to SOUTH.
- (11, 14): Dead End Pocket. Wall at (11, 13) and (12, 14) blocks access to the north plateau.
- (11, 15): Gap in the city wall (Y=15). Accesses the beach area but not the plateau.

# Quest Strategies
## Suicune: 'The Western Land Bridge' (Bypasses Everything)
- Discovery: The northern plateau (Suicune's spot) is connected to the western beach, which can be reached on land by navigating gaps in the city's internal walls.
- Route:
    1. From (13, 19), walk West to (11, 19).
    2. Walk South to (11, 21) to enter the southern beach area.
    3. Walk West to (2, 21), passing through the gap in the X=3 wall (Y=20-22).
    4. Walk North along the western edge (X=2) to Y=14.
    5. Walk East to (8, 14) to enter the plateau area.
    6. Walk North to (14, 10) to reach the sighting spot.
- Fact: This is a 100% land-based route that ignores buoys, surfing, and repels.
- Preparation: Lead with XENON (Haunter).
- Start Turn: 47680 (Suicune North Beach Quest)
