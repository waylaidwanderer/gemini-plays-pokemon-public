# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Active Strategy: The Northern Sea Bypass
The city's internal walls and ledges block direct access to the northern plateau. The only viable path is to surf around the city via the northern sea.

1. Run from the current battle at (28, 45). (In Progress)
2. Surf North along X=28/27 to Row 8, passing through the buoy gap at (27, 9).
3. Surf West along Row 8 to X=14 (Directly above the trigger point).
4. Move South to land at (14, 10) and trigger the Suicune sighting.
5. Defeat Eusine (Lead: Calcifer Lv64).

## Verified Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement (e.g., Row 46, Row 34).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement (e.g., Row 15).
- Buoy Gap: (27, 9) is a confirmed passage to the northern sea.

## Progress Tracking
- Turn 49869: Escaping wild Tentacool.
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) approach from the North.
