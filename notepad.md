# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Investigate Team Rocket Hideout (Mahogany Town).
- **Secondary Goal:** Open Locked Doors on B2F.
- **Immediate Task:** Trigger the event to open the doors (likely Rival encounter).
- **Status:** Have passwords ("SLOWPOKETAIL", "RATICATE TAIL"). Door says "Needs password".

## Team Rocket Hideout Status
- **B1F:** Security disabled.
- **B2F:** Lance met. Locked doors at (14,12) & (15,12).
- **B3F:** Passwords obtained. Boss room locked.
- **Objectives:**
    1. Open B2F Locked Doors.
    2. Defeat Executive.
    3. Defeat Boss.

## Tile Mechanics
- COUNTER: Impassable.
- **Observation:** Locked doors on B2F at (14, 12) and (15, 12) say "Closed" and "Needs password" respectively. Interaction failed despite having passwords.
- **Hypothesis:** Missing a trigger. Maybe exploration of West B2F or B1F is required. Or Lance is elsewhere.
- **Action:** Moving to West B2F Ladder (3, 14).
- **Exploration:** Returned to B1F via West Ladder (3, 14).
- **Hypothesis:** A Warp Panel on B1F might lead to a restricted area or trigger the next event. Checking Warp Panel at (5, 15).
- **Observation:** B1F is fully connected (East/West joined by gap at 9,4).
- **Status:** Passwords obtained ("SLOWPOKETAIL", "RATICATE TAIL"). B2F Door locked ("Needs password").
- **Blocker:** B2F Door likely requires a different password.
- **Findings:** Bookshelves at (4,13), (6,13), (7,13) contain "Rocket Oath".
- **Achievement:** Obtained 2nd password "RATICATE TAIL" from Grunt at (5, 14).
- **Status:** Have both passwords ("SLOWPOKETAIL", "RATICATE TAIL").
- **New Hypothesis:** These passwords open the Locked Doors on B2F at (14, 12), which likely conceal a ladder to the walled-off Boss Room on B3F.
- **Observation:** Warp Panel at (5, 15) on B1F was a trap (led to entrance).
- **Status:** Have passwords "SLOWPOKETAIL" and "RATICATE TAIL".
- **Current Barrier:** Boss Room at (10,9)/(11,9) is in a walled-off area (NW quadrant). Access from South/East blocked by walls/counters.
- **Hypothesis:** The Grunt at (5, 14) moves after giving the password, revealing a switch in the bookshelf at (5, 13).
- **Analysis:** The Boss Room entrance (10,9) on B3F is in a completely isolated area (NW quadrant). No access from B3F floor.
- **Conclusion:** Access MUST be via a ladder/stairs from B2F (or B1F). The B2F Locked Doors (14,12 & 15,12) are the only remaining path.
- **Hypothesis:** I interacted with the wrong door tile or need to try again.
- **Correction:** The B2F Locked Doors (14,12 & 15,12) are for the Transmitter Room (requires Executive Voice/Murkrow).
- **Game Logic:** Passwords -> Open Boss Room (B3F) -> Defeat Executive -> Murkrow opens B2F Doors.
- **Observation:** B2F West is divided by a wall at Row 12. I am on the South side.
- **Observation:** I can see an Item Ball at (3, 10) in the North side, but cannot reach it from here.
- **Conclusion:** I must access B2F North-West from B1F.
- **Immediate Plan:** Go back UP to B1F (Ladder at 3,14). Explore the North-West area of B1F to find a staircase leading to B2F North-West.
- **Goal:** Reach B3F Boss Room via B2F NW -> B3F NW.
- TRAP TILES: The floor tiles in the corridors of B1F trigger inescapable battles (Koffing, Geodude, Voltorb). Must fight.
