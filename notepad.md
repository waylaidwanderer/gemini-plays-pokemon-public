# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Reach the Dragon Shrine via the East Whirlpool.

# Current Status (Turn 18312)
- **Location:** Dragon's Den B1F (26, 22).
- **Condition:** In Battle (Wild Magikarp).
- **Action:** Flee Battle.
- **Reasoning:** Magikarp is not a threat and gives negligible EXP. Priority is exploration.
- **Previous Action Result:** Interactions with buoys at (27, 22) and (26, 23) did not yield "Whirlpool" text before the battle started (or were interrupted). Likely not the path.

# Plan
1. Flee from Magikarp.
2. Navigate North to (26, 20) to explore the channel.
3. Look for a gap in the barrier or another path.

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Obstacle. Requires HM06 + Badge.
- **Buoy:** Likely unbreakable barrier here.
- **Water Channel:** Leads North.

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Requires HM06 Whirlpool + Glacier Badge. 
- **Lava/Magma:** (None here).
- **Ice:** (None here).

# Lessons
- **Menu Navigation:** Always verify cursor position before committing to a sequence. Blind input leads to wrong menus (e.g., PACK instead of POKEMON).
