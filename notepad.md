### Strategic Reflection (Turn 8719)
- **Status**: Stuck in Goldenrod for ~100 turns.
- **Issue**: Oscillating between East/West without clearing the "fog of war".
- **Insight**: The North-East (Flower Shop) is a cul-de-sac. The Central North Wall seems solid. The only remaining option is the North-West quadrant, which is largely "unseen".
- **Action Plan**: 
    1. Return to Main Street (y=10).
    2. Move West to x=6.
    3.Systematically explore North from there, hugging the West edge.

### Navigation Notes
- **Location**: Goldenrod City (South Side).
- **Goal**: Reach Far West Edge (x=0).
- **Status**: At (18, 14). Moving to (4, 20) to bypass Radio Tower from the South.
- **Reasoning**: Direct West path at Radio Tower (Row 15) was blocked. Critique suggests the path North is along the Far West edge (x=0), reached from South of the Radio Tower.
- **Plan**:
    1. Go South-West to (4, 20).
    2. Go West to (0, 20).
    3. Head North along the edge.

### Quest Chain: SquirtBottle
1. **Defeat Whitney**: Done (Plain Badge obtained).
2. **Find Floria**: Currently seeking at Route 36.
3. **Get Bottle**: Return to Flower Shop after meeting Floria.

### Key Locations
- **East Crossing**: (18, 14).
- **Radio Tower**: (5, 15).
- **Target Area**: (0, 20).
