# Suicune Quest
- Objective: Trigger sighting in Cianwood City at the northern shore.
- Strategy: The Great Southern Bypass (Confirmed Land Route)
    1. Walk to (21, 35).
    2. Walk to (23, 44) (bypasses wall at X=21, Row 43 via PokeCenter).
    3. Walk to (21, 44), then South to (21, 51).
    4. Walk West along Row 51 to (4, 51).
    5. Walk North to (4, 44), then West to (2, 44).
    6. Walk North along the West Coast corridor (X=2) to Row 14.
    7. Navigate to the northern shore at (7, 4).
- Note: This route uses confirmed land gaps and avoids all ledges. Row 51 is the key horizontal thoroughfare.
- Suicune sighting count = 1.

# Tile Mechanics (Cianwood)
- FLOOR: Standard walkable ground.
- WATER: Traversable only while Surfing.
- WALL / FLOOR_UP_WALL / LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: All act as IMPASSABLE obstacles from the north in Cianwood.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- Interaction: Surf from FLOOR adjacent to WATER by pressing A.

# Confirmed Corridors
- Row 51: Clear from X=4 to X=23.
- X=4: Clear from Row 44 to Row 51.
- X=2: Clear from Row 14 to Row 49.

# Lessons Learned
- Cianwood ledges are impassable from the north.
- Internal walls divide the city into vertical strips.
- Row 51 is the only confirmed clear horizontal path between the eastern and western strips.
- Always reveal tiles manually before planning long-distance routes.
