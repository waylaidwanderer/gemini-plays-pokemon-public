# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
## Strategy: Great Southern Loop (Row 50)
Reach (14, 10) by bypassing all land ledges via the Row 50 gap.
1. Move East to (12, 33).
2. Move South along X=12 to (12, 49).
3. Move West to (10, 49) and South to (10, 50) (Row 50 gap).
4. Move West along Row 50 to (2, 50) (Western Corridor).
5. Walk North along X=2 to Row 12 (bypasses Row 15 ledge).
6. Walk East to (14, 12) and North to (14, 10).
- Current Step: Moving to (12, 33).

# Progress Notes
