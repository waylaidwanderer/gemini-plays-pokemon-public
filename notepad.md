# Radio Tower Crisis (Started Turn 8588)
## Strategy (HOW)
1. Floor-by-floor sweep (1F -> 4F accessible areas cleared).
2. Find the Director and Card Key in Goldenrod Underground.
3. Use Card Key on 3F (14, 2) to reach upper floors.
4. Defeat Rocket Executives and clear the tower.

## Tower Intel
- **Card Key Slot**: 3F (14, 2).
- **Shutters**: 3F (14, 2), 4F (11, 4), 5F (14, 3).
- **Partition**: 4F is split; upper floors require Card Key. But 5F is reachable via left side of 4F (0, 0).
- **Directory**: 1F Reception, 2F Sales, 3F Personnel, 4F Production, 5F Director's Office.

## Underground Progress (Map 3_53)
- **Status**: Found the Basement Door at (18, 6). It is LOCKED (requires Basement Key).
- **Hypothesis**: Fake Director on 5F has Basement Key. Real Director in Basement has Card Key.
- **NPCs**: Super Nerds Donald/Teru/Eric (Defeated). Haircut Brother, Granny (Shopkeepers).
- **Warps**: Ladder (3, 2) -> North. Ladder (3, 34) -> South. Door (18, 6) -> Basement.

## Completed Badges
- Zephyr, Hive, Plain, Fog, Storm, Mineral, Glacier.

## Navigation & PC
- **Counter Interaction**: Face the counter, not the NPC.
- **Fly Map (Goldenrod)**: Discrete presses: 4 Ups, 6 Lefts from New Bark Town.
- **PC Storage**: SHUCKIE (Lv15), ROCKY (Lv6), EGG (Lv5), XFDW (Lv16), FRITTATA (Lv5).
## General Lessons Learned
- **Partitioned Layouts**: When a map is split (like Radio Tower 4F), look for alternate stairs on lower floors or Key Items (like Card Key) to open shutters.
- **Object Identity**: During events (like takeovers), NPCs may be replaced by different sprites (e.g., Receptionist replaced by Rocket Grunt). Always interact to verify.
- **Counter Interactions**: To talk to someone behind a counter, stand on the tile directly in front of the counter and face it.
- **Root Hypotheses**: If stuck, re-evaluate the base assumption. The fake Director likely has the Basement Key needed for the Underground.
## Tower Progress
- 1F: Cleared.
- 2F: Cleared.
- 3F: Cleared (accessible areas).
- 4F: Scientist Rich and one Rocket Grunt defeated on left side.
- 5F: Reached. Target: Director's Office.
