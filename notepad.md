## Reflection (Turn 103)
- **Notepad:** Added a section for my Pokémon team.
- **Agents:** A pathfinding agent is still a future consideration.
- **Hindsight:** Need to be careful about pressing buttons before dialogue is fully dismissed.
- **Goals:** Goals are solid and updated. Primary: Find Mr. Pokémon. Secondary: Explore New Bark Town.
- **Assumptions to Verify:**
    1. The path to Mr. Pokémon is north of New Bark Town.
    2. The rival battle will happen upon leaving town.
    3. No special items are needed to reach Mr. Pokémon.
    4. The healing machine in Elm's lab works.
