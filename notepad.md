# Tile Mechanics - Global
- FLOOR: Standard walkable tile.
- WALL: Impassable boundary.
- WATER: Traversable only with Surf.
- BUOY: Impassable boundary in water.
- WARP_CARPET: Triggers map transition when walked off the map edge.
- HEADBUTT_TREE: Blocking object; can be interacted with using Headbutt.
- CUT_TREE: Blocking object; requires HM01 Cut and interaction from adjacent tile to remove.
- COUNTER: Impassable barrier often found in shops or gatehouses; allows interaction with NPCs behind it.
- CAVE: Map transition entry point.
- TALL_GRASS: Walkable; triggers wild battles.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump down; impassable from below.

# Suicune Quest Strategy (Crystal)
- Current Status: Re-evaluating sighting triggers. Sages in Tin Tower 1F have been spoken to.
- Key Items: Clear Bell (Acquired)
- Prerequisite Strategy: Eusine must be defeated at Cianwood City north shore. (Status: Verified).
- Route 42 Trigger: (26, 15) - Small clearing with 3 Apricorn trees outside Mt. Mortar middle entrance.
- Route 36 Trigger: (35, 9) - Near the junction where Sudowoodo was.
- Final Encounter: Tin Tower (static battle) after all wild sightings and Wise Trio battle.

## Battle Strategy (Wise Trio)
- Trio will only battle after Route 42 and 36 sightings are complete.
- Sage Gaku (Lead): GNEISS (Graveler) Lv44 (Earthquake, Rollout).
- Sage Masa: GNEISS or Calcifer.
- Sage Koji: GNEISS (Rollout) or Kimchi.

## Capture Strategy (Suicune)
- Hypothesis: Suicune is a static encounter in Tin Tower (Crystal) at Lv40.
- Lead: XENON (Gastly) Lv21 (Hypnosis, Night Shade).
- **CRITICAL RISK:** Xenon is severely underleveled (Lv21 vs Lv40). Suicune will likely outspeed and KO Xenon before Hypnosis can be used. Consider training a faster/bulkier sleep inducer or using items to boost speed.
- Items: 43 Great Balls, 1 Ultra Ball.
