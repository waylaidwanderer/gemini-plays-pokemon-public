# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement (acting as a ledge). Passable from SOUTH to NORTH.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at Row 15 (X=3-17).
- ROCK: Smashable rocks act as WALLs.
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- Started: Turn 49630
## Strategy: The Sea Route (Confirmed)
Reach (14, 10) by surfing through specific buoy gaps.
1. Move to (24, 15) and West to (23, 15) (Gap in Row 15).
2. Move North to (23, 8) (Gap in X=22 wall).
3. Move West to (14, 8) (Above the plateau).
4. Move South to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

# Progress Notes
- Verified: X=22 wall is solid from Row 9 to Row 15. Gap at Row 8.
- Verified: Row 15 wall is solid from X=18 to X=22. Gap at X=23.
- Verified: X=19 wall is solid from Row 15 to Row 20. Gap at Row 14.
- Verified: The plateau is accessible from WATER at Row 8-14 (X=14-16).
- Verified: Row 9 is a solid buoy wall from X=22 to X=26. Bypass at X=27.
