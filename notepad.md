# Ilex Forest Quest: Runaway Farfetch'd
*Started Turn 2803*

## Goal: Catch the bird to obtain HM01 (Cut).

## Puzzle Mechanics
- **Success Condition**: Interact from the tile directly behind the bird's facing direction.
- **Startle Logic**: Interacting from the front or side makes the bird fly ~6 tiles away.
- **Twig Logic**: Tiles with dark specs are noisy. Stepping on them makes the bird turn to face the player.
- **Verified Noisy Tiles (Specs)**: 
  - Row 26: (14, 26), (15, 26)
  - Row 28: (14, 28) to (18, 28)
  - Row 29: (17, 29), (18, 29)
  - Row 31: (23, 31) to (29, 31)
- **Verified Clean Tiles**: Row 23, Row 24, Row 25, Row 27, Row 30.

## Current Status
- Bird is at (15, 29). Facing: UP.
- Target: Make it face RIGHT by stepping on (17, 28), then catch from (14, 29).
- Approach: Go around the wall via Row 23 to reach (17, 28). Row 23 is clean.

## Tile Mechanics
