# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable. Individual Behavior: Standard movement.
- WALL: Impassable. Individual Behavior: Blocks movement. Mechanics: Interact with objects (signs, PCs) from adjacent tiles.
- TALL_GRASS: Traversable. Individual Behavior: Triggers wild encounters.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Traversable (One-way South). Relational Behavior: Jump down from North; impassable from South/East/West.
- LEDGE_HOP_LEFT: Traversable (One-way West). Relational Behavior: Jump across from East; impassable from West/North/South.
- LEDGE_HOP_RIGHT: Traversable (One-way East). Relational Behavior: Jump across from West; impassable from East/North/South.
- CAVE: Traversable/Warp. Individual Behavior: Entrance to indoor areas.
- WATER: Traversable with SURF. Mechanics: Requires HM03 Surf and appropriate badge.
- CUT_TREE: Blockage. Mechanics: Removed by using HM01 Cut.
- BOULDER: Blockage. Mechanics: Pushed by using HM04 Strength.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable. Individual Behavior: Represents the base of a ledge or wall.

# Strategy: Rising Badge (Gym Leader Clair)
- Opponent Analysis: Uses Dragon-types. Kingdra (Water/Dragon) is the primary threat, weak only to Dragon-type moves.
- Tactical Plan: Use Xenon's Night Shade for fixed damage (28+ HP per turn) to bypass high defenses. Gneiss provides physical bulk and Earthquake. Calcifer's Thunderpunch is neutral but powerful.
- Training Goal: Level Xenon and Kimchi to 30+ to improve stats and move consistency.

# Strategy: Johto League Training
- Method: Lead with lower-level Pokemon (Kimchi/Xenon) to share EXP. Switch to Gneiss or Calcifer for heavy lifting.
- Efficiency: Grind in Route 45 grass (4,12)-(5,12).
- Resource Management: Return to Blackthorn PC when Gneiss runs out of Earthquake PP (currently 10/10).

# Progress Tracker
- Xenon (Lv28): 18371 EXP. Target Lv30: 21760 EXP (~3389 remaining).
- Kimchi (Lv25): 13402 EXP. Target Lv30: 21760 EXP (~8358 remaining).
- Gneiss (Lv46): 129/129 HP. Earthquake PP: 10/10.
- Xenon Status: 48/72 HP. Night Shade PP: 7/15.
- Calcifer (Lv48): 146/152 HP. Flame Wheel PP: 21/25.
- Grinding Start: Turn #31060 (Tuesday, Jan 6, 2026, 3:20 PM).
- Encounter Log: Donphan (Lv25/30), Geodude (Lv23), Graveler (Lv23/27), Gligar (Lv24), Skarmory (Lv24). Gligar uses Sand-Attack/Poison Sting. 
- Sleep Powder Mystery: Failed on Lv30 Donphan, Lv23 Graveler, and Lv24 MALE Gligar. Worked on Lv24 FEMALE Gligar and Lv23 Geodude. 
- Hypnosis Test: Worked on Lv23 Graveler (Turn 31417). Failed on Lv24 MALE Gligar (Turn 31456) with "It didn't affect".
- Hypothesis: Certain wild Pokemon in this area may have a hidden attribute or held item (like Mint Berry/Insomnia-equivalent) that provides sleep immunity, or there's a version-specific mechanic I'm uncovering. The message "It didn't affect" is key.
- Reflection (Turn 31456): Gligar's Quick Attack doesn't affect Xenon. Switching to direct damage with Night Shade to avoid further failed status attempts.
- Hypnosis Test: Confirmed Hypnosis works on Graveler (Turn 31417). Sleep Powder's failure on Donphan/Graveler is likely move-specific or due to an unknown factor (not type immunity).
- Inventory Note: Have 4 REVIVEs; can use them to extend training if PP is not an issue.
- Lessons Learned: Night Shade deals damage equal to user's level. Ignore battle text phone icons (sprite artifacts). Selfdestruct is a major threat from Graveler.

# Evolution Methods (Hypotheses)
- Gloom: Likely Leaf or Sun Stone.
- Haunter: Likely Trading (check for in-game trades or item-based alternatives).

# General Mechanics & Lessons
- Route 45 Navigation: Ledges make most paths one-way SOUTH. Use FLY to return to Blackthorn.
- Strength: Must be activated manually via the menu or by interacting with a boulder while the HM is known.
- Fly Map: Always verify destination city name in screen text before pressing A.
