# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Objective
Trigger the Suicune sighting at (14, 10) in Cianwood City (Map 22_3).

## Strategy: The Western Bypass (Land Route)
1. Obtain Rock Smash: Talk to Pokefan M at (17, 33). (Dialogue triggered, but TM not received. Re-evaluating need.)
2. Wall Gap: Walk West from (16, 33) to (5, 34) to pass through the internal wall.
3. Terrace Ascent: Walk North through Column 4 and climb the one-way slopes:
   - Climb 1: (4, 30) [UP_WALL]
   - Climb 2: (4, 20) [UP_WALL]
4. Northern Loop: Walk North to Row 14, East to (8, 14), North to Row 12, and East to (14, 12).
5. Trigger Event: Reach (14, 10).

## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way North slopes (e.g., (4, 30), (4, 20), (6, 46)).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way South ledges (e.g., (10, 15)).
- WALL: Solid barriers partitioning the city.

## Key Coordinates
- (17, 33): Pokefan M.
- (5, 34): Gap in the central wall.
- (14, 10): Suicune trigger point.
## Strategy: Finding TM08 Rock Smash

  2. Check Mania's House at (17, 41). (Completed: Mania asks for his Shuckle back)
  3. Talk to Pokefan F at (11, 46). (Completed: Talks about her husband)
  4. Re-verify Pokefan M (18, 33) by talking from the south (18, 34). (Next)
  5. Talk to Lass at (14, 40).
  6. Check Lugia Speech House at (15, 37).
