# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Verified Strategy: The Terrace Climb
The northern plateau (14, 10) is accessible via a series of one-way upward transitions that bypass the ledge system. This is a land route requiring a detour to the southern part of the city via the gap at Row 37.

### Verified Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way North. Blocks South movement (Verified at (6, 46)).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way South. Blocks North movement.

### Execution Plan
1. Southern Detour: Walk North to Row 37, West to Column 4, and South to Row 47+.

   - Climb 3: (4, 30)
   - Climb 4: (4, 20)
3. Trigger Suicune: Reach (14, 10) to initiate the event.
