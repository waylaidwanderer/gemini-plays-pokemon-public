- Objective: Trigger scripted flee event (Sighting 3) on Route 42 island.
- Status: Suicune confirmed on Route 42 via Pokedex (Turn 21433). Sprite not yet visible.
- Strategy: Walk over all floor tiles on the Route 42 island to trigger the sighting. Start with northern section.
- Observations:
    - Turn 21433: Pokedex AREA map shows Suicune blinking on Route 42.
    - Turn 21434: Arrived on island floor. Sprite missing. Trigger tile required.
- Lessons Learned:
    - Pokedex: Alphabetical (A-Z). Suicune follows Sudowoodo.
    - Scripted: Sighting sequence is fixed. Pokedex AREA map tracks the current scripted location.
    - Animation: Sprite flees with a visible jump. If no jump seen, event is not complete.
