# Strategic Plans
## Locate Suicune (Cianwood North Beach)
- Status: Arrived in Cianwood. Verified (11, 15) is a dead end pocket.
- Current Task: Verify West Beach Shortcut.
- Hypothesis: Walking North along the beach at X=2 allows access to the plateau at Y<10, bypassing the buoy maze.
- Path: Navigate to (2, 11) and continue North.
- Success: Reaching (7, 4).
- Failure: Ledge or Wall blocking X=2 at Y=10. Revert to 'Great Spiral' buoy maze.

## The Great Spiral (Backup Plan)
- Entrance: (27, 30).
- Route: Lane 1 (N) -> Lane 2 (S) -> Lane 3 (S) -> Lane 4 (N) -> Lane 5 (N) -> Land at (14, 10).
- Requirements: Surf, Super Repel.
