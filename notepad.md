# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement. PASSABILITY FROM SOUTH TO NORTH UNVERIFIED. Found at (4, 20), (16, 10), (8, 34).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at (10, 15).
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- Start Turn: 49771
- Start Time: 3:29 PM

## Strategy: The Outer Sea Route (Final)
The Central Pool (X=12-17) is an enclosed pocket. Access to the northern plateau requires the Outer Sea (X=24+).
1. Land at (12, 28). (Completed)
2. Walk East to (23, 32) (Eastern Beach). (Completed)
3. Surf East to (24, 32) to enter the Outer Sea. (In Progress)
4. Surf North along X=25 to Row 10.
5. Surf East to (27, 10), then North through (27, 9) buoy gap to Row 8.
6. Surf West along Row 8 to (16, 8).
7. Surf South to (16, 12) to land on the plateau.
8. Walk West to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune sighting.

# Progress Notes
- Discovered: Central Pool is blocked by buoys at X=16 (Rows 25-29) and X=18 (Rows 15-25).
- Note: No wild encounters on land in the city. Out of Repels.
- Hypothesis: (16, 12) is the intended landing point for the northern plateau sighting.
- Hypothesis: FLOOR_UP_WALL allows landing from the East/West (Testing required).
