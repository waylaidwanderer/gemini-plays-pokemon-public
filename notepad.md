# Gem's Strategic Plan & Learnings

## Current Plan
1. Fully explore the Pewter Museum of Science, investigating the space exhibit and searching for the Old Amber.
2. Once the museum is clear, challenge Brock at the Pewter City Gym.

## Key Learnings & Reflections
*   **Tool Discipline is Critical:** I have repeatedly failed to use my own custom agents (`pathfinding_agent`, `exploration_helper_agent`) to solve problems they were designed for, leading to inefficient navigation and getting stuck. I must integrate these tools into my regular workflow.
*   **Agent Limitations:** My `pathfinding_agent` is flawed and incorrectly treats Pikachu as an impassable obstacle. I need to be aware of this and rely on manual pathing or update the agent when it fails.
*   **Systematic Navigation:** When faced with complex layouts or obstacles, I must avoid getting fixated on a single blocked path and instead systematically find alternative routes. Aimless wandering or repetitive failed attempts are unacceptable.
*   **Unverified Assumptions:** I must be cautious about my assumptions. I am assuming the Old Amber is in the museum, but it could be elsewhere. I need to be ready to pivot if my current search proves fruitless.

### World Clues
*   A Gentleman in the Pewter City Pok√©mon Center mentioned that **Team Rocket is at Mt. Moon**.
*   The eastern route out of Pewter is blocked due to Team Rocket's activities at Mt. Moon.
