# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Navigation Notes
- **Strategy**: Underground Search (Goldenrod).
- **Status**: Route 34 South Loop failed (blocked by water/coast).
- **Plan**: Return to Goldenrod -> Systematically search for Westward path to Underground Entrance (11, 29) between Row 20 and 35.
- **Hypothesis**: There must be an alley or gap I missed West of the Main Road.

### Key Locations
- **Sister's House**: (29, 5).
- **Flower Shop**: (19, 1). Needs Sudowoodo interaction.
- **Gym**: (24, 7).
- **Route 34 Exit**: South edge (Row 35).
- **Tracks**: West edge (Column 3-4).
- **Underground Entrances**: South at (11, 29), North presumably near Game Corner (9, 5).

### Quests
- **Sister's House**: (29, 5). The sister is missing (Route 36).
- **Route 35 Gatehouse**: East Side (x=31) is a dead end.
- **Plan**: Return to Goldenrod -> Enter Underground at (11, 29) -> Exit North -> Find path West to Route 35 Gatehouse.
- **Reasoning**: South Loop failed due to one-way ledges. Underground is the best bet to bypass city blocks.
- **Objective**: Reach North-West corner for Route 35.

### Status
- Badges: 3 (Zephyr, Hive, Plain).
- Party: Quilava (26), Sentret (2), Bellsprout (6), Togepi (5), Rattata (8).
- Route 34 Navigation: To reach the Daycare, travel North along the West path (main road) and enter the yard through the gap in the fence at (11, 15). Watch out for the Officer at (10, 16).
- Route 34 Item Ball at (7, 30) is blocked by a ledge at x=9 (One-way West->East?). Must approach from Goldenrod City/West side.
- Confirmed: Wall at x=35 blocks East access from Row 6-19.
- Tracks blocked at (3, 16) by Rude Tourist.
- Plan: Execute 'South Loop' strategy. Travel South to Row 30+, move West to the tracks (x=3-4), and head North to bypass barriers.
- Exit Hypothesis: Route 35 Exit is in the North-West corner, accessible via the tracks/Radio Tower path.
- Facts: Main Avenue (x=18) and East Side (x=29) are dead ends.
- Sandbox status: Down.
- **Transition**: Goldenrod (18, 35) connects to Route 34 (8, 0).
- **Plan**: Move West in Route 34 to finding the Tracks entrance (likely x=4 or lower).
