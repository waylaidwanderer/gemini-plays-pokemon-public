## Lessons Learned
- S.S. Aqua sailors block corridors; check Game State for exact positions.
- Super Nerd (26, 9) blocks the x=26 corridor on B1F.
- Map transitions reset NPC positions and can progress scripted events.
- Path to western 1F is likely via B1F (East 1F -> East B1F -> West B1F -> West 1F).
- Finding the 'lazy bum' buddy involves talking to the sailor looking for him (31, 6) and then the buddy himself (30, 6).
