# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) in Cianwood City to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The Row 51 Land Bridge
- Plan:
  1. Use Super Repel. [DONE]
  2. Walk South to Row 51 (e.g., (19, 51)). [IN PROGRESS]
  3. Walk West along Row 51 to West Beach (X=2).
  4. Walk North along West Beach (X=2) to (2, 14).
  5. Walk East to (8, 14), then North to (8, 12).
  6. Walk East along Row 12 to (14, 12), then North to (14, 10).
- Status: At (19, 30). Repel active.
- Reasoning: City is partitioned by vertical walls (X=5, X=9). Row 51 is the only confirmed continuous horizontal land path from the east side to the West Beach (X=2). X=2 is a clear vertical highway past all city blockades up to the northern plateau.

# Blocked Routes (Verified)
- Central City: Vertical walls at X=5, X=9, X=11, X=17.
- Row 15 Barrier: Solid wall/ledge from X=3 to X=17.
- Row 30/34/46 Barriers: Impassable cliffs (FLOOR_UP_WALL).

# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard ground. Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Surf required. Traversable.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable cliff face.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
