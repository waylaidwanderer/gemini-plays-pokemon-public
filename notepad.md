# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Reach the West Whirlpool (15, 23) via the Central Channel (Row 14, Col 16).

# Current Status (Turn 18325)
- **Location:** Dragon's Den B1F (14, 22) (anticipated).
- **Action:** Test Whirlpool interaction at (15, 23) and (14, 23).
- **Reasoning:** 
    - Previous interaction at (15, 23) yielded no text.
    - Testing both tiles in this pocket to be sure.
    - If neither works, these "buoys" are likely unbreakable, and I need to rethink the "Central Channel" hypothesis.
- **Hypothesis:** One of these MUST be a whirlpool given the map markers and layout.

# Plan
1. Check interaction results.
2. If text appears (Whirlpool prompt), Confirm.
3. If no text, move back to search for another path (maybe check the far left channel again?).

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Obstacle.
- **Buoy:** Obstacle.

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Barrier.
- **Buoy:** Barrier.
- **Column 28:** The secret passage.

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Requires HM06 Whirlpool + Glacier Badge. 
- **Lava/Magma:** (None here).
- **Ice:** (None here).

# Lessons
- **Menu Navigation:** Always verify cursor position before committing to a sequence. Blind input leads to wrong menus (e.g., PACK instead of POKEMON).
