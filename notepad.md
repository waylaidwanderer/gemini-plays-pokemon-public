# I. Game Mechanics & Traversal
## A. Core Rules
- **Level Cap:** 8 badges = Level 65.
- **PC Interaction:** Stand directly below the PC, face up, and press 'A'.
- **HM Usage:** HMs are used from the party menu. Fainted Pokémon can use field moves.
- **Surfing:** Not all `ground` tiles adjacent to `water` are valid starting points.
- **Puzzle Resets:** Leaving and re-entering a floor resets all boulders to their original positions.
- **Off-Screen State Changes:** An object's state will not update in the map data until it is visible on-screen.
- **Boulder Pushing:** A boulder can be pushed from an adjacent tile by facing it and pressing the corresponding direction. Pushing a boulder always moves the player into the boulder's vacated space, regardless of the angle of the push. Boulders cannot be pushed into `impassable` tiles.

## B. Tile Glossary & Movement Rules
- `ground`: Standard walkable tile.
- `grass`: Wild Pokémon encounters.
- `water`: Requires SURF.
- `impassable`: Wall.
- `ledge`: One-way traversal. Can only be jumped DOWN from the tile directly above. Acts as a wall from all other directions.
- `elevated_ground`: Walkable, different elevation. It is NOT possible to step down from an `elevated_ground` tile to an adjacent `ground` tile.
- `steps`: Allows movement between `ground` and `elevated_ground` in both directions.
- `boulder_switch`: Floor switch for boulders.
- `boulder_barrier`: Impassable barrier linked to a boulder switch.
- `cleared_boulder_barrier`: A former barrier that acts as a one-way ramp. It is possible to move from it onto `elevated_ground` (elevation 2), but it is NOT possible to move from it directly back down to `ground` or to enter it from ANY adjacent `ground` tile.
- `hole`: Drops to a lower floor. Pushing a boulder into one causes it to appear on the floor below.
- `spinner`: Forces movement.
- `cuttable`: A tree that can be removed with the HM Cut.
- `ladder_up`: Warps to a higher floor.
- `ladder_down`: Warps to a lower floor.

# II. Battle Intel
## A. Type Effectiveness Chart (Verified)
- **Super Effective (2x):** Psychic > Ghost, Poison; Ghost > Psychic; Electric > Rock, Water; Flying > Grass, Poison, Fighting; Ice > Ground, Grass, Flying, Dragon; Ground > Poison, Fire, Electric, Rock, Ground; Rock > Fire, Ice, Flying, Bug; Fighting > Normal, Rock, Ice; Water > Fire, Ground, Rock; Grass > Water, Ground, Rock; Bug > Grass, Poison, Psychic; Poison > Grass, Bug

- **Immune (0x):** Flying immune to Ground; Ground immune to Electric; Ghost immune to Normal, Fighting
- **Correction:** Psychic-type moves deal NEUTRAL (1x) damage to Rock-type Pokémon.

## B. Strategic Notes
- **"No Will to Fight" Message:** A party menu cursor error on a fainted Pokémon, not a refusal to battle.
- **Struggle Mechanic:** Struggle is only used automatically when a Pokémon is out of PP for ALL of its moves.
- **Full Heal Mechanic:** This item ONLY cures status conditions. It does NOT restore HP. This was verified by attempting to use it on multiple injured Pokémon with no status effects, which resulted in the message 'It won't have any effect.'

# III. Current Strategy: Victory Road Navigation
- **High-Level Goal:** Reach the eastern side of Victory Road 2F to solve the main boulder puzzle.
- **Current Location:** Western, isolated section of Victory Road 2F.
- **Hypothesis:** The path to the eastern side requires ascending to 3F from the west, crossing over on 3F, and descending back to 2F on the east.
- **Immediate Objective:** Reach the ladder to Victory Road 3F at (2, 2).
- **Current Obstacle:** A boulder at (6, 6) blocks the path to the ladder.
- **Plan to clear boulder:**
    1. Navigate to (7, 6).
    2. Face left and push the boulder from (6, 6) to (5, 6).
    3. Once the path is clear, navigate to the ladder at (2, 2).

# V. Tool & Agent Principles
- **Scientific Method:** Use a scientific approach: form a hypothesis, test it, and document the conclusion. Do not modify tools to test hypotheses; test them with in-game actions first.
- **Trust System Feedback:** System feedback (like validation warnings or tool errors) is the source of truth and MUST be trusted over personal assumptions or agent outputs.
- **IMMEDIATE ACTION:** Flaws in tools or data management (notepad, markers) must be addressed immediately, not deferred as goals.
