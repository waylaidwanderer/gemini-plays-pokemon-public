# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Investigate Team Rocket Hideout.
- **Secondary Goal:** Access B3F Boss Room (NW Corner).
- **Status:**
    - Passwords "SLOWPOKETAIL" and "RATICATE TAIL" obtained.
    - B2F Locked Doors (14,12 & 15,12) require Executive/Murkrow (Transmitter Room).
    - B3F Boss Room is walled off from the East/South.
    - B2F West is split by a wall at Row 12. Northern part (with Item Ball) is unreachable from South.
- **Hypothesis:** A hidden path (stairs/hole/trap) exists in the B1F North-West corner (x=1-5, y=1-5) leading to B2F North-West.

## Team Rocket Hideout Status
- **B3F:** Boss Room unlocked. Executive defeated. Murkrow has the password.
- **B2F:** Lance met. West Ladder (3,14) connects to B1F. Locked doors need password.
- **B1F:** Security disabled. Trap Warp at (5,15).

## Tile Mechanics
- **Trap Tiles:** B1F corridors (Geodude/Voltorb/Koffing).
- **Security Cameras:** Trigger alarms/battles.
- **Locked Doors:** Require specific triggers (Passwords or Key Items).

## Action Log & Reflection
- **Status:** Locked Door at B2F (14, 12) is OPEN.
- **Discovery:** The opened door allows access to the central corridor (Row 10-11).
- **Observation:** This corridor connects West to the Voltorbs at x=7 and East to the Voltorbs at x=22.
- **Plan:** Enter the room. Go West to defeat the Voltorbs at (7, 7) and (7, 9). Then go East to defeat the others.
- **Objective:** Disable the radio signal by defeating all Electrodes/Voltorbs.
