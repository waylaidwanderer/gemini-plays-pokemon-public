# Current Puzzle: The Wise Trio & The Sealed Room
- **Goal:** Access the center room (Suicune) or trigger the Wise Trio battle.
- **Status:** Spoke to all 3 Sages. They gave lore but did not battle.
- **Problem:** Warp at (10,2) is INACTIVE (not listed in Game State Warps).
- **Hypothesis:** I must trigger the battle with the Wise Trio to unlock the path.
- **Plan:** Re-approach Sages and attempt to move past/into them to trigger the event. Starting with Sage at (14,6).

# Map Markers
- **Sages:** (5,9), (14,6), (11,11).
- **Beasts:** Suicune (9,9), Entei (12,12).

# Lore
- **Wise Trio:** Testing me.
- **Brass Tower:** Burned down. 3 beasts reborn.
- **Analysis:** I've defeated the Wise Trio (in the Barrier Station) and battled Suicune once (and lost). Suicune is likely still here.
- **Problem:** Can't reach Suicune. Warp at (10,2) is inactive.
- **Correction:** Sage at (5,9) changes facing direction (Left -> Up observed).
- **Action:** Interacting with Sage at (5,9) from the side (4,9).
- **Hypothesis:** If he doesn't battle, I need to find the stairs to 2F in the unexplored corners.
- **Plan:** Interact, then explore bottom-left corner (0,15).
- **Observation:** Sage at (5,9) did not battle when interacted with.
- **Map Analysis:** Bottom-Left area (2-6, 15) appears isolated by walls.
- **Plan:** Navigate to (8,15) to inspect the wall at (7,15). If impassable, the area is sealed.
- **Map Analysis:** Bottom-Left room (Row 15, Col 2-6) is inaccessible from 1F. Must be a drop zone.
- **Entei Marker:** Marker at (12,12) appears to be ghost data (Entei is not currently there).
- **Plan:** Explore suspicious nooks in Top-Left area: (3,9) and (2,7).
- **Hypothesis:** Hidden stairs or switches might be in these secluded tiles.
- **Action:** Exploring Top-Left Corner (3,2) for stairs.
- **Analysis:** Bottom-Right corner (17,15) appears physically inaccessible from 1F (surrounded by walls).
- **Hypothesis:** Stairs to 2F must be in the Top-Left.
- **Note:** "Mystery Warp" at (10,2) is likely an exit.
- **Plan:** Navigate to (3,2). If empty, I will try using the Clear Bell manually.
- **Action:** Traversing Wise Trio Room (4_2) to Barrier Station (4_1).
- **Goal:** Reach Main Ecruteak City to access Barrier Station Main Entrance.
- **Path:** Ladder at (1,4) -> Barrier Station (17,3).
- **Reasoning:** Need to reset Suicune event by talking to Sages at the Main Entrance. Current location (Bell Chime Trail) is the wrong side.
- **Hypothesis:** The ladder at (17,15) in the Barrier Station (Right Side) connects to the Left Side or leads to the City.
- **Plan:** Take the ladder at (17,15).
- **Status:** Returned to Tin Tower 1F.
- **Action:** Navigating to Warp (10,2).
- **Hypothesis:** "Please, do go on" from Gatekeeper reset the warp functionality.
- **Contingency:** If warp fails, I will attempt to battle the Wise Trio (Sages) by walking into them or speaking to them.
- **Lore:** Suicune is waiting.
