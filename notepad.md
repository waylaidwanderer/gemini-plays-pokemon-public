# Blackthorn Gym Strategy
- Use Ice-type moves (Gyarados/Icy Wind, Sneasel, Swinub) against Dragons.
- Clear all trainers for XP.
- Navigate floor by floor.
- Current Target: Solve Boulder Puzzle (South-East).
- Defeated Cooltrainer F at (4, 11).
- Boulders located at (8, 14) and (6, 16).
- Strategy: Push Boulder 4 (6, 16) South, then circle to (8, 15) to push Boulder 3 (8, 14) North into Pit (8, 7).
- Gym 2F Layout: Split into sections. West ladder (1, 7) leads to dead end with boulders. Must traverse South/East path past Cooltrainer F at (4, 11) to reach upper area.
- Puzzle Mistake: Pushed Boulder 4 (6, 16) South to (6, 17) where it is stuck. Correct path is North -> East -> North -> East to Pit (8, 7).
- Boulder 3 (8, 14) appears to be a decoy or stuck in column 8.
- Plan: Reset room via ladder (1, 7) and retry.
- Alternative Solution: North Boulders (2, 3) and (3, 3).
- Boulder 1 (2, 3) can be pushed South into Pit (2, 5).
- Access via column 1 from Ladder (1, 7).
