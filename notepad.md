# Suicune Quest Strategy: 'Western Beach Walk'
- Goal: Reach Suicune at (7, 4).
- Fact: The northern part of the island (north beach) is accessible by land via the far western beach (X=0 to X=2).
- Solution: Walk across the land bridge at Y=30 to the western beach, then walk north to the northern plateau.
- Route:
    1. From (19, 30), walk Left to (2, 30).
    2. Walk North to (2, 14).
    3. Walk East and North through the plateau: (2, 14) -> (8, 14) -> (8, 12) -> (14, 12) -> (14, 10).
    4. Approach Suicune sighting area at (7, 4).
- Preparation: Lead with XENON (Haunter) for Hypnosis. Be ready for Eusine.
- Status: At (19, 30). Cleared Surf, landing now.
- Failed Hypotheses:
    - 'Triple Gap Loop' (Attempts: 2): Dead end. X=26 wall is solid from Row 0-9. Row 9 wall is solid from X=22-26.
    - 'Island Bypass (Surf)' (Attempts: 1): Unnecessary. Land route is simpler.
