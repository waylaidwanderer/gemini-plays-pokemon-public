# Suicune Hunt Strategy
## Repel Trick Setup
- Lead: KIMCHI (Lv 21 Gloom).
- Method: Super Repel filters wild Pokémon (Lv 13-16). Suicune (Lv 40) is the only encounter.
- Inventory: Super Repel x7. Confirmed at Slot 15 in PACK.
- Verification: To check if Repel is active, attempt to use one; the game will say "The REPEL used earlier is still in effect."

## Suicune Battle (Lv 40)
- Flee Mechanic: Suicune flees on its first turn unless asleep or trapped.
- Speed: Suicune (85) outspeeds KIMCHI (40). It will flee before Sleep Powder.
- Strategy: Inflict Sleep to prevent fleeing in subsequent encounters. HP and status are persistent.
- Catch Rate: ~0.39% (Full HP, No Status, Great Ball). Increases to ~4.3% if asleep.
- Contingency: If progress stalls, catch a faster Pokémon (e.g., Haunter for Hypnosis/Mean Look).

## Navigation
- Roamer Logic: Suicune moves routes ONLY when crossing map boundaries (Route 38/39 edge), using Fly, or after a battle.
- Boundary: Route 38 (0, 10) <-> Route 39 (19, 10).
