# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The Buoy Maze Master Path (Step-by-Step)
- Plan:
  1. Land at (15, 30) and walk to (19, 30). [IN PROGRESS]
  2. Surf at (19, 30) to enter the main channel (Columns 20-29).
  3. Navigate North to (27, 10), then West through Gap 1 (26, 10) to (23, 10).
  4. Navigate South to (23, 16), then West through Gap 2 (22, 16) to (20, 16).
  5. Navigate South to (20, 21), then West through Gap at (19, 21) to (17, 21).
  6. Navigate North to (17, 16), then West to (14, 16).
  7. Land at (13, 16) and walk to (14, 10).
- Status: At (15, 27) on water, heading south to land.
- Reasoning: The inner pockets are blocked by buoy walls at X=16 and X=18. Entering the main channel at (20, 30) is the only way to reach the outer gaps.
