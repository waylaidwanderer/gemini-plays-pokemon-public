# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL / FENCE: Impassable.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN (Y=13, 15): One-way South.
- LEDGE_HOP_LEFT (X=10): One-way West.
- LEDGE_HOP_RIGHT (X=7, 21): One-way East.
- TALL_GRASS / LONG_GRASS: Traversable, wild encounters.

# Route 38/39 Mechanics & Exploration
- Lane Analysis:
  - Top Lane (Rows 0-6): Fragmented by walls. Eastern strip (X=4-35) reachable via Ecruteak or gaps at X=30-35. Western Pocket (X=0-2) is currently isolated.
  - One-Way Restriction: Route 38 is effectively a one-way path West due to ledges at X=7 and X=10. Walking from Olivine to Ecruteak is impossible.
- Search Log:
  - Top Lane (X=4-35): Searched. No Suicune.
  - Western Pocket (X=0-2): Unexplored. Isolated.
  - Route 39 Barn: Searched. No Suicune.
- Current Plan: 
  1. Fly to Ecruteak City (Done).
  2. Enter Route 38 from the East and walk West along the Top Lane (Rows 0-6) to find Suicune (Sighting #4) near the Miltank farm.
  3. Head to National Park (via Route 36) to obtain the Quick Claw from the lady at (17, 10) on the rightmost bench.
  4. Continue the Suicune hunt at Route 14.

# Lessons Learned
- Menu Mechanics: Use single button presses or "B-reset" (press B 4 times) for deep menus to avoid cursor persistence errors.
- Suicune Tracking: Overworld sightings don't register in Pokedex. Tracking is impossible until roaming starts after Tin Tower.
- False Constraints: Don't assume you can walk back to missed spots on routes with ledges. Pivot to Fly immediately.
- Bug Catching Contest: Active today (Thursday). May affect National Park access.
