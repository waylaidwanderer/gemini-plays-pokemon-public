# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Challenge the Pokémon League.
- **Secondary:** Defeat the Elite Four.
- **Tertiary:** Train team.

# Current Status
- **Location:** Will's Room (Elite Four).
- **Party:** Healthy. Muscle (Lv61) leading.
- **Inventory:** 6 Hyper Potions, 10 Revives, 2 Full Restores.
- **Money:** Low (¥589).

# Exploration Log
- **Victory Road:** Fully traversed.
- **Indigo Plateau:** Lobby explored. Shopping done.

# Plan
1.  **Battle:** Talk to Will and win.
    - **Strategy:** Muscle (Lv61) spams Strength.
    - **Reasoning:** Strength (Normal) is neutral vs all his dual-Psychic types (Flying, Ice, Grass, Water). Cross Chop (Fighting) is resisted by Psychic and Flying, making it poor vs Xatu, Exeggutor, Slowbro.
    - **Matchup:** Muscle outlevels by ~20 levels. Expect OHKOs.
2.  **Next:** Advance to Koga's room.

# Battle Log
- **Vs Will:**
  - **Xatu:** Defeated.
  - **Jynx:** Current opponent.
    - **Status:** Muscle 108/205 HP. Jynx Full HP.
    - **Speed:** Jynx is faster.
    - **Action:** Muscle uses STRENGTH.
    - **Outcome Prediction:** Jynx uses Psychic (~90 dmg). Muscle survives with <20 HP. Strength OHKOs Jynx.
- **Turn 19117:** Previous attempt failed to register (inputs eaten by lag/animation?). Menu is stable now. Cursor on PACK.
- **Action:** Manual Input: Up (FIGHT) -> A -> A (STRENGTH).
- **Status:** Muscle 108/205. Committing to attack to break the heal loop.
- **Turn 19118:** Cursor confirmed on FIGHT.
- **Action:** Manual Input: A (Select Fight) -> A (Select Strength).
- **Prediction:** Jynx attacks (Muscle survives ~14 HP). Strength kills Jynx.
- **Turn 19119:** Menu confirmed open. Selecting STRENGTH.
- **Contingency:** If Muscle faints (Crit), send **Sneasel** (Immune to Psychic, Resists Ice). Use Shadow Ball.
- **Turn 19120:** Declined switch (initially).
- **Revision:** Changing mind! Switching to **Sneasel**.
- **Reasoning:**
  1. Exeggutor will likely use Psychic (Super Effective on Muscle).
  2. Sneasel is immune to Psychic. Safe switch-in.
  3. Sneasel (Faster) uses **Screech** (-2 Def) then dies.
  4. Muscle returns and OHKOs -2 Def Exeggutor with Strength.
- **Action:** Up (Select YES) -> A (Confirm). Next turn: Select Sneasel.
- **Turn 19122:** Switching to **Kunai (Sneasel)**.
- **Matchup:** Sneasel vs Exeggutor.
- **Prediction:** Exeggutor uses Psychic (Immune). Sneasel enters safely.
- **Next Turn:** Use Shadow Ball (Super Effective) or Screech.
- **Turn 19123:** Confirming switch to Kunai (Sneasel).
- **Strategy:** Sneasel absorbs Psychic (Immune).
- **Follow-up:** Sneasel uses Shadow Ball (Super Effective) or Screech. If Sneasel faints, Muscle returns to finish.
- **Turn 19126:** Kunai used Shadow Ball (Super Effective, ~40% dmg). Exeggutor used Egg Bomb (Missed).
- **Situation:** Kunai (Full HP) vs Exeggutor (~60% HP).
- **Action:** Shadow Ball again. Expecting Kunai to outspeed.
- **Contingency:** If Kunai faints, Muscle finishes with Strength.
- **Turn 19127:** Kunai fainted (Crit Egg Bomb).
- **Strategy:** Send **Muscle** (108 HP).
- **Matchup:** Muscle (Faster) vs Exeggutor (60% HP).
- **Prediction:** Strength deals ~95% of remaining HP. Muscle likely faints to Psychic.
- **Cleanup:** Finish low HP Exeggutor with Garnet (Quick Attack) or Gyarados. Revive Muscle after battle (or during if needed).
- **Turn 19128:** Cursor is on Muscle. Selecting to switch in.
- **Battle Plan:** Muscle (108 HP) vs Exeggutor (~60% HP).
- **Action:** Use Strength.
- **Prediction:** Muscle outspeeds and KOs Exeggutor.
- **Turn 19129:** Muscle is active. Main Menu Open.
- **Action:** Selected STRENGTH.
- **Reasoning:** Fighting moves are resisted by Psychic. Ground is resisted by Grass. Normal (Strength) is neutral and our strongest option.
- **Prediction:** Exeggutor takes heavy damage/faints. Muscle likely takes a Psychic if Exeggutor survives.
- **Turn 19130:** Exeggutor defeated. Sneasel fainted earlier.
- **Incoming:** Slowbro (Lv 41).
- **Decision:** Stay in with Muscle (108/205 HP).
- **Analysis:** Jynx (Higher Sp.Atk) did ~94 dmg. Slowbro should do less (~80-85). Muscle survives one Psychic.
- **Plan:** Attack with Strength. Muscle is faster.
- **Turn 19131:** Declined switch. Slowbro entering.
- **Analysis:** Muscle (108 HP) vs Slowbro (Lv 41).
- **Damage Calc:** Jynx (115 SpA) did 94 dmg. Slowbro (100 SpA) will do less (~80). Muscle survives non-crit.
- **Action:** Strength (80 BP, Neutral). Dig (60 BP) is weaker. Cross Chop/Rock Smash resisted.
- **Plan:** 2HKO Slowbro. Survive one Psychic.
- **Turn 19132:** Confirming "NO" to switch (A button).
- **Next:** Will sends Slowbro.
- **Action:** Advance text (B spam).
- **Next Turn:** Select FIGHT -> STRENGTH.
- **Strategy:** 2HKO Slowbro. Tank one Psychic.
- **Turn 19134:** Slowbro used Curse (+Atk, +Def, -Spd).
- **Matchup:** Muscle (108/205) vs Slowbro (+1 Def).
- **Action:** Strength.
- **Analysis:** Slowbro has high Def (110 Base + 50% boost). Strength might do less than expected. Dark moves (Special) would be better, but Gyarados has low SpA. Sticking with Muscle for now due to level advantage (62 vs 41).
- **Turn 19135:** Attacking with Strength.
- **HP Check:** Muscle 108/205.
- **Risk:** Slowbro Psychic (~80 dmg). Muscle survives (28 HP).
- **Benefit:** If Slowbro uses Body Slam/Curse, we maintain HP advantage.
- **Scenario:** If damage is low (due to Curse), we may need to heal next turn.
- **Crit:** A crit Strength ignores the Defense boost. Pray for crit.
- **Turn 19136:** Muscle uses Strength.
- **Goal:** Chip damage. Hopefully 2HKO even with +1 Def.
- **Note:** Slowbro's Speed fell, so Muscle is definitely faster.
- **Turn 19137:** Slowbro defeated.
- **Incoming:** Xatu (Lv 42).
- **Decision:** Decline switch ("NO"). Stay with Muscle.
- **Status:** Muscle 24/205 HP. Critical.
- **Plan:** Use Hyper Potion immediately. Muscle survives Psychic (~90 dmg). Then Strength.
- **Turn 19138:** Cancelled switch (B button). Muscle stays in.
- **Battle:** Will sends Xatu (Lv 42).
- **Plan:** Use Hyper Potion (Priority). Muscle (24 HP) will heal to full.
- **Math:** Muscle (205 HP) vs Xatu Psychic (~80 dmg). Muscle survives.
- **Next:** Strength to KO.
- **Turn 19139:** Advancing text (Xatu entry).
- **Next:** Menu opens. Use Hyper Potion on Muscle immediately.
- **Battle:** Muscle (24/205) vs Xatu.
- **Notes:** Muscle speed (88) vs Xatu (Est ~85). Close call. Healing ensures survival.
- **Turn 19140:** Menu open. Selecting PACK.
- **Action:** Use Hyper Potion on Muscle.
- **Reasoning:** Muscle (24 HP) is in kill range. Xatu is faster. Healing is mandatory.
- **Next:** Navigate Bag -> Select Hyper Potion -> Use on Muscle.
- **Turn 19142:** Using slow_press to Apply Hyper Potion on Muscle.
- **Sequence:** A (Item) -> A (Use) -> A (Muscle).
- **Goal:** Full Health (205/205).
- **Next:** Battle continues. Muscle attacks.
- **Turn 19143:** Muscle fully healed (205/205).
- **Action:** Advancing text.
- **Anticipation:** Xatu attacks (Psychic/Drill Peck/Confuse Ray).
- **Next Turn:** Muscle attacks with Strength.
- **Turn 19144:** Cursor on PACK.
- **Action:** Manual Input: Up (FIGHT) -> A -> A (STRENGTH).
- **Matchup:** Muscle (126/205) vs Xatu (Full).
- **Prediction:** Xatu attacks (Psychic, ~80 dmg). Muscle survives (unless Crit). Muscle uses Strength (~50% dmg).
- **Turn 19145:** Menu confirmed on FIGHT.
- **Action:** Manual Input: A (Enter Fight Menu) -> A (Select Strength).
- **Matchup:** Muscle (126/205) vs Xatu (Lv 42).
- **Prediction:** Strength deals ~50-60%. Xatu attacks (Psychic). Muscle survives.
- **Next:** Finish with Strength.
- **Turn 19146:** Muscle uses Strength.
- **HP Status:** Muscle 126/205.
- **Prediction:** Strength deals ~50%. Xatu attacks (Psychic -> ~46 HP).
- **Next:** Finish with Strength or heal if crit happens.
- **Turn 19147:** Muscle used Strength. Xatu used Confuse Ray.
- **Status:** Muscle 126/205 HP (Confused). Xatu ~60% HP.
- **Inventory Note:** Out of Full Restores.
- **Plan:** Use **Full Heal** (or Bitter Berry) to cure confusion.
- **Reasoning:** Cannot risk confusion self-hit loops. Muscle outspeeds Xatu, so clearing status guarantees an attack next turn.
- **Turn 19148:** Using Hyper Potion on Muscle (126/205 HP).
- **Reasoning:** Cursor is already on Hyper Potion. Scrolling for Full Heal is risky/slow. Healing to 205 HP protects against Critical Hit Psychic (which deals ~160+).
- **Sequence:** A (Item) -> A (Use) -> A (Muscle).
- **Next:** Muscle heals to full. Xatu attacks. Muscle (Confused) tries to attack next turn.
- **Turn 19149:** Cleared heal text.
- **Next:** Xatu attacks (likely Psychic).
- **Goal:** Survive attack, then Fight -> Strength. Hopefully breakthrough confusion.
- **Turn 19150:** Will used Max Potion. Xatu back to 100% HP. Muscle 100% HP (Confused).
- **Action:** Select FIGHT.
- **Next:** Select Strength. Hope to break through confusion.
- **Turn 19151:** Menu is on STRENGTH.
- **Action:** Press A to Attack.
- **Risk:** Confusion self-hit (~30 dmg).
- **Prediction:** Muscle attacks (or hurts self). Xatu attacks.
- **Goal:** Chip Xatu down again.
- **Turn 19152:** Selected Strength.
- **Status:** Muscle (205/205, Confused) vs Xatu (Full HP).
- **Risk:** Confusion check.
- **Next:** Xatu attacks (Psychic).
- **Goal:** Land 2 hits to KO Xatu again.
- **Turn 19152 Result:** Muscle hurt itself (~30 dmg) + Psychic (~80 dmg).
- **Status:** Muscle 97/205 HP. Confused. Xatu 100% HP.
- **Crisis:** HP critical. Psychic (80-95 dmg) could kill next turn.
- **Action:** Opening Pack.
- **Plan:** MUST use Hyper Potion. Full Heal/Bitter Berry is too risky (Muscle might die to Psychic this turn). Healing HP is priority.
- **Turn 19153:** Move Menu open. Backing out to use Item.
- **Action:** B (Back) -> Down (Select Pack) -> A (Open Pack).
- **Goal:** Open Bag to access Hyper Potions.
- **Status:** Muscle 97/205 (Confused). Critical HP.
- **Turn 19154:** Menu confirmed on FIGHT.
- **Action:** Select PACK (via tool).
- **Goal:** Use Hyper Potion.
- **Status:** Muscle 97/205 (Confused). Critical danger.
- **Turn 19155:** Using Hyper Potion on Muscle.
- **Sequence:** A (Select Item) -> A (Select Use) -> A (Select Muscle).
- **Status:** Muscle 97/205 -> 205/205.

- **Status:** Muscle 125/205 (Confused). Xatu 100% HP.
- **Action:** Manual Input: Up (FIGHT) -> A -> A (STRENGTH).
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - If self-hit: 125 - ~30 = 95. Xatu hits for ~80. Survives with ~15 HP.
  - If successful: Xatu takes ~50-60% damage.
- **Decision:** Must attack. Cannot stall forever.
