# Strategic Notes
## Objectives
- **Primary:** Reach Indigo Plateau (Money Farming Loop).
- **Secondary:** Defeat Elite Four.
- **Tertiary:** Hunt Roamers (Raikou/Entei) - *Paused*.

## Current Task: Defeat Elite Four
- **Location:** Indigo Plateau - Will's Room (16_3).
- **Goal:** Defeat Will (Psychic Type).
- **State:** Battling Exeggutor. Switching to Lugia (Maelstrom).
- **Matchup:** Lugia (Flying/Psychic) vs Exeggutor (Grass/Psychic).
- **Strategy:**
  1. **Switch:** Swap to Maelstrom (Slot 2) since I'm locked in the menu.
  2. **Exeggutor:** Use `Gust` (Flying vs Grass = Super Effective).
  3. **Next Mons:**
     - Slowbro: Lugia's `Thunder` (if I have it? Notepad says Hydro Pump/Rain Dance/Recover/Gust). Wait, Lugia doesn't have Thunder.
     - Muscle is better for Slowbro. I can switch back to Muscle after Exeggutor.
  - **Plan:** Lugia kills Exeggutor. Switch Muscle back in for Slowbro.

## Reflection (Turn 33071)
- **Status:** Battle against Rival Silver is active.
- **Hygiene:** Updating notepad to reflect battle state after previous edit failures.
- **Strategy:** Switching to type advantage (Fighting vs Steel).
