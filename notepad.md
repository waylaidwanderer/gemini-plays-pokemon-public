### Navigation Notes
- **Location**: Goldenrod City (South-West).
- **Goal**: Reach East Goldenrod (Game Corner/Flower Shop) via Route 34.
- **Current Action**: Heading to Route 34 Gatehouse at (4, 29).
- **Reasoning**: The West side (where I am) is isolated from the East side by barriers at x=9 and Row 21. The only way to the East side seems to be exiting South to Route 34, moving East, and re-entering.
- **Hypothesis**: The city is split into two sections at the South end, connected via Route 34.
