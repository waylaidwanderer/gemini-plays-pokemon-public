# Ice Path Strategy
- **Current State:** At Hub (14, 16).
- **Goal:** Find access to West Corridor (x=0) or North Ice Area.
- **Hypothesis:** One of the Row 18 ledges is jumpable. Tested (8-12, 18) = Fail. Testing (7, 18).
- **Plan:**
  1. Move to (9, 17) via Hub Floor.
  2. Test Down movement into (9, 18), (8, 18), (7, 18).
  3. If successful, access West Corridor and go North.
- **Backup:** Check North Alcove (11, 15) for secrets.

# Map Structure
- **Hub:** Isolated loop.
- **West Corridor:** Accessed via SW Floor (Row 22+).
- **Access Point:** Likely a ledge at Row 18 or Row 22. (14, 22) failed. Row 18 is the best bet.
- **Critical Insight:** Previously blocked at (5, 16) despite it looking like FLOOR. This suggests a barrier separating the Hub from the West Corridor.
- **Hypothesis:** The "South Ledges" or the Ice Puzzle are the only ways to cross this barrier.
- **Current Action:** Testing Ledge at (9, 18). If blocked, the West Corridor must be accessed via a different route (possibly a hole from the floor above?).
- **Note:** Check for any "Holes" or "Ladders" I might have missed in the layout.
