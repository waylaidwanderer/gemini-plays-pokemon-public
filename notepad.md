# Game Mechanics & Lessons

## Agent Development & Battle Tactics
- The `master_pathfinder_agent` has consistently failed and is unreliable. I will stop using it until I can debug its code. Manual navigation is the current standard procedure.
- Battle tactics need to be more proactive. I will not wait until a Pok√©mon's HP is critical before using priority moves like Quick Attack. 
- If running from a wild battle fails more than twice, it is more efficient to defeat the opponent.
