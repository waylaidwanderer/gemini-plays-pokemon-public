- Step 3: Buy Super Repels at Ecruteak Mart (¥500 each).
- Step 4: Put XENON (Lv21) in the lead.
- Step 5: Move between Ecruteak and Route 38. Check Pokedex AREA after each transition.
- Step 6: When Suicune is on Route 38, use Super Repel and run in grass.
- Note: Suicune is Level 40. Mean Look must hit on Turn 1.
- Mechanic: Roaming Pokemon move every time the player transitions between routes or cities.

# Lessons Learned
- Cannot use FLY from inside buildings; must be outdoors.
- Roaming Pokemon (Suicune) relocate upon EVERY map transition (city-to-route, route-to-city).
- FLYING forces roaming Pokemon to a completely random location in Johto.
- Poké Mart inventories scale with Badge progress; Super Repels appear later.
- Interacting with clerks behind counters: Face the counter tile, not the NPC.
