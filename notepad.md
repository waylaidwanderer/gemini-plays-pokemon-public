## Discovered Tile Types & Movement Rules
- **ground**: Walkable.
- **impassable**: Walls, objects, etc. Not traversable.
- **warp**: Map transition. Activation varies (instant 1x1, or 2-step for larger like exit mats/gatehouses).
- **water**: Requires Surf.
- **grass**: Wild encounters.
- **ledge**: Jump down only. Cannot move 'up' onto a ledge tile from lower ground. To jump down, be on higher ground adjacent to the ledge, move onto the ledge tile.
- **NPC Blocking**: NPCs can block paths. Player cannot move onto a tile occupied by a stationary NPC if it's the first step of a path from pathfinder or by pressing in their direction when adjacent and facing them. Dialogue loops cannot be broken by re-interacting.
- **Pikachu Movement**: If Pikachu is adjacent in movement direction & player not facing him, 2 presses needed (1st turns, 2nd moves). Normal otherwise.
- **PC Interaction**: Stand below, face up, press A.

## Type Matchup Discoveries (Verified)
- Ghost > Psychic.
- Poison > Bug; Bug !> Poison.

## Agent Strategy & Ideas
### Active/Available Agents:
1.  **Level Cap Compliance Agent** (`level_cap_compliance_checker`): Defined. Checks Pok√©mon levels against current cap. Should test soon.
2.  **Item Finder Agent** (`item_finder_agent`): Defined. Locates items/buildings. Value needs re-evaluation for current tasks.

### Future Agent Ideas:
1.  **Viridian Forest Navigator**: Helps navigate Viridian Forest. (Consider defining soon if forest proves complex).

### Discontinued Agents:
-   `route_pathfinder`: Consistently failed.
-   `exploration_prioritizer_agent`: Often gave unhelpful suggestions.

### General Agent Notes:
-   Ensure system prompts are robust and include all necessary game context.
-   Input schemas should not include auto-provided variables like `map_xml_string` for code-enabled agents.

## World Knowledge Graph (WKG) Best Practices
- Record inter-map transitions (map boundary, warps) immediately using `manage_world_knowledge`.
- Use descriptive names and tags for nodes.
- Include exact coordinates and connection types.
- Note `destination_entry_point` for warps when known.

## Map Marker Best Practices
- Mark defeated trainers (‚ò†Ô∏è), used warps (üö™), key info NPCs (üí°/üí¨), signs (‚ÑπÔ∏è), obstacles (üöß), items given by NPCs (üéÅ).
- Use distinct emojis and concise labels. Delete redundant markers.

## Lessons Learned & Strategy Refinements
-   **Trust Game State**: GSI is absolute truth for dynamic data (NPCs, items, map connections reachability).
-   **Pathing**: Double-check tile types (especially ledges) before committing to a path. NPCs can block movement. Repeatedly trying to move onto a blocking NPC or through a dialogue loop is inefficient.
-   **Critical Path**: Prioritize objectives that unblock main progression.
-   **Efficiency**: Plan longer movement sequences. Avoid repeated interactions if the first attempt yields no new info. Record failed interaction attempts.
-   **Hypothesis Testing**: Form hypotheses, test systematically, document failures and attempt counts.
-   **Route 22**: Was a detour. Path to Pewter is North from Viridian City via Route 2 / Viridian Forest.
-   **Mart Exit (Viridian)**: Exits to (30,21) outside Mart, not School House. WKG/Marker updated.
-   **Route 1 Ledge Navigation**: Multiple failed attempts to navigate ledges before finding correct paths. Improved understanding: cannot move 'up' onto a ledge from lower ground.
-   **Viridian Forest Gate Warp**: The warp at (5,1) in the South Gate was impassable. Used (6,1) successfully.
-   **NPC Interaction**: If an NPC dialogue repeats and no battle/event occurs, do not re-interact. Mark and move on.

## Current Exploration Plan (Viridian Forest)
- Systematically explore unseen tiles.
- Look for items (especially Antidotes, Potions), battle trainers for EXP, and find the North exit.
- Consider catching a new Pok√©mon (e.g., Caterpie, Weedle, Mankey if available).
- Monitor SPARKY's level (currently Lv8, cap 12).
