- TYPE_80fc: Ledge (Jumpable Down)
- Row 15 West leads to a dead end at x=13.

- Vertical Ledge at x=28 (Map 24_3) is a one-way jump West (from x=28 to x=27).
- Continuous Ledge Row at y=9 seems to separate an upper path (y=8) from the lower path.
- TYPE_5519: Cut Tree (Impassable without Cut)
- x=28 (Rows 10-12) is a solid tree wall.
- Trapped in pocket at x=27. Must go South to escape.
