# Current Strategy: Return to Red
- **Timestamp:** Turn 26590 (Jan 7, 2026) [Silver Cave Room 2]
- **Status:** Descended waterfall to Room 2 Lower (7, 30).
- **Observation:** The waterfall path loops back to the Room 1 entrance area (17, 31).
- **Hypothesis:** The path to Red is NOT via the waterfall descent. It must be via a different path, possibly through the Item Rooms (South Section).
- **Plan:**
  1. Land at (14, 30) to explore the southern area.
  2. Look for any other cave entrances or hidden items in this lower section.
  3. If nothing found, reconsider the Item Rooms ledges or look for a hidden path in Room 1.

# Key Findings
- **Item Rooms (3_77):** Northern ledges (Row 4) are impassable/one-way.
- **Silver Cave Room 2:**
  - Water connects central area to unknown West/East areas.
  - Warp (13, 21) -> Item Rooms North (Loop).
  - Warp (17, 31) -> Room 1 (Loop).
