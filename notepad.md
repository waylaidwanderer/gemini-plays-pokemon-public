## Hypothesis Testing: Suicune sighting sequence
- **Hypothesis 1:** Suicune is on Route 42 island.
- **Test 1:** Fly to Ecruteak, go to Route 42, and step on EVERY tile of the island and surrounding water.
- **Hypothesis 2:** Suicune is on Route 36 junction.
- **Test 2:** If Route 42 fails, approach Route 36 junction from all four directions (North, South, East, West).
- **Hypothesis 3:** Eusine needs to be spoken to again.
- **Test 3:** Check Ecruteak Pokemon Center for Eusine.
- **Attempt 1 (Turn 25425):** Stepped on (26, 14) on Route 42 island. Suicune did not appear.
- **Attempt 2 (Turn 25426):** Swept the entire island platform. Suicune did not appear.
- **Conclusion:** Route 42 sighting is either not next or requires another trigger. Moving to Hypothesis 2 (Route 36) and Hypothesis 3 (Eusine).
- **Pivot Started (Turn 25430):** Moving to Ecruteak City to check Hypothesis 3 (Eusine) and then Hypothesis 2 (Route 36). Timestamp: Turn 25430, Saturday 1:41 AM.
