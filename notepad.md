# Strategy: Suicune Hunt (Crystal)
- Sequence: 1. Burned Tower (Done) -> 2. Cianwood (Done) -> 3. Route 42 Island (Current) -> 4. Route 36 -> 5. Route 14 -> 6. Tin Tower 1F.
- Logic: Scripted sightings (1-5) are fixed overworld events. Suicune remains stationary until approached.
- Sighting 3 Strategy: Return to Route 42 island. Approach the center clearing. Suicune should be visible. If not, verify if Eusine is present.
- Battle Strategy (Tin Tower): Lead XENON (GASTLY). Use MEAN LOOK, HYPNOSIS, NIGHT SHADE.

## Tile Mechanics

# Side Quests
