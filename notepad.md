# I. Meta-Strategy & Core Principles
1.  **Immediate Maintenance:** All data management (notepad, markers) and tool/agent refinement is the HIGHEST priority and MUST be performed in the same turn a need is identified, regardless of game state. Deferring these tasks is a critical failure.
2.  **Proactive Automation & Refinement:** Before any complex or repetitive task, I must first consider automating it with a tool or agent. If one doesn't exist, creating it is the new priority. If an agent or tool is suboptimal, I must prioritize refining it immediately.
3.  **Trust, But Verify:** I must trust the outputs of my agents and system data. However, if a tool's output contradicts the Game State Information, my assumption must be that the tool is wrong, and I must debug it.
4.  **Hypothesis-Driven Exploration:** All exploration must be guided by a clear, documented hypothesis. I must avoid wandering aimlessly and systematically test one variable at a time, documenting all results.
5.  **Warp Discipline:** After every warp, my first action must be to check and, if necessary, create/update markers on **both** the departure and arrival maps.
6.  **Mandatory Self-Assessment:** Every 50 turns, I must perform a structured self-review to ensure my strategies, documentation, and tool usage remain optimal and aligned with my core principles.
7.  **Efficiency Over Fixation:** If a simple automation tool fails during a low-stakes, repetitive task (like a wild battle), it is more efficient to complete the task manually and fix the tool later, rather than getting stuck debugging mid-task.
8.  **Battle Menu Anomaly (Confirmed):** The system's tool execution is unreliable when combining directional inputs with an action button ('A') in a single turn. Automation must separate these into separate turns.

# II. Game World Mechanics
- **Gameplay Mechanics:**
    - **Trap Battles:** Certain wild encounters appear to be 'trap' battles where the 'RUN' option is disabled (Observed: Wigglytuff, KADABRA; Suspected: Ditto).
    - **Fossil Regeneration:** The Cinnabar Lab has a machine to regenerate fossils.

# III. Quest Log
- **Current Quest: The Mt. Moon Fossil**
    - **Objective:** Find a fossil to give to the Rocket Grunt blocking the path at Mt. Moon B2F (30,12).
    - **Hypothesis:** One of the rocks in Mt. Moon is interactable and contains a fossil.
    - **Method:** Systematically check every single 'impassable' rock tile on all floors of Mt. Moon.
    - **Progress:** All reachable rocks on Mt. Moon 1F have been checked and were not interactable.
    - **Next Step:** Proceed to Mt. Moon B1F and begin the systematic rock search there.

# IV. Battle Intel
- **Type Effectiveness Chart (Verified):**
    - Water is super-effective against Rock/Ground (Observed: OMANYTE's SURF vs GEODUDE).
    - Water is not very effective against Bug/Grass (Observed: OMANYTE's BUBBLEBEAM vs PARAS).
    - Poison is not very effective against Poison/Flying (Confirmed: ECHO's SLUDGE vs ZUBAT) and Rock/Ground (Observed: ECHO's SLUDGE vs GEODUDE).
    - Flying is not very effective against Rock/Ground (Observed: ECHO's FLY vs GEODUDE).
