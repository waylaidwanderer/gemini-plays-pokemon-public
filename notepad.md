- **Correction**: The "Gap" at Row 22 is blocked at x=16.
- **Discovery**: Row 15 is the Key Crossing from East (Main Road) to West (Radio Tower side).
- **Plan**: Go North to Row 15 -> East to Main Road (x=18) -> North to Row 8 -> West through Gap to x=16 -> Explore North for Route 35 Exit.
- **Immediate**: Escape dead end (Up, Right to Main Road).
- **Timestamp**: Turn 7993.

- **Status**: Successfully navigated to West Corridor (Row 8) via Row 15 bypass.
