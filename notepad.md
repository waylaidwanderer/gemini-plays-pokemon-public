# Suicune Quest Log (Crystal Version)
- Prerequisites: Clear Bell (Obtained), All overworld sightings must be triggered in order.
- Start: Turn 24182, Saturday 12:45 AM.

## Story Progress
- Team Rocket: Disbanded at Radio Tower.
- Tin Tower: Shook after entering gatehouse with Clear Bell.
- Sages (Gatehouse & 1F): All talked to after tower shook.

## Sighting Progress
1. Burned Tower: Verified.
2. Cianwood City (North): Verified.
3. Route 42 (Central Island): [FAILED] Full sweep of island on Turn 25893 yielded no sighting. 
   - Hypothesis 1: Sighting may only trigger when entering Route 42 from the Ecruteak (West) side. 
   - Hypothesis 2: Missing prerequisite in Ecruteak (Wise Trio Room interaction).
4. Route 36 (Sudowoodo Junction): Pending. Checked once.
5. Tin Tower 1F: Pending.

## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable. Standard ground collision.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Traversable with SURF. 
- CUT_TREE: Impassable; remove with CUT. Regrows.
- GRASS / TALL_GRASS: Traversable; triggers encounters.
- CAVE / DOOR / WARP: Transitions.
- LADDER: Vertical transition. Functions as a warp.
- HEADBUTT_TREE: Impassable.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable from the NORTH (cannot move DOWN into it). Acts as the top edge of a wall or ledge. Verified at (53, 14) and (55, 10).

## Strategy
- Current: Navigate the Tin Tower Gatehouse restricted area to reach the Wise Trio Room.
- Troubleshooting: Battle and defeat the Wise Trio to unlock the Suicune sighting on Route 42.
- Alternative: If Route 42 is cleared, check the Sudowoodo junction on Route 36.
