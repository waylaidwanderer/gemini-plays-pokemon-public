# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn the Zephyr Badge in Violet City.
- **Secondary:** Reach Cherrygrove City.
- **Tertiary:** Switch TOPAZ to Lead.

## Quest Log (Completed)
- Delivered Mystery Egg to Elm.
- Received Pokedex from Oak.
- Defeated Rival Silver.

## Game Mechanics & Lessons
- **Lesson:** ALWAYS verify "Important Events" log before assuming quest state. I backtracked unnecessarily because I forgot I had already done the Mr. Pokemon event.
- **Battle:** Watch "Text History" closely. If "Got away safely!" appears, the battle is over. Do not attempt to run again.
- **Menus:** Wait for visual confirmation (text/cursor) before inputting subsequent menu commands.
- **Running:** Success depends on Speed. If slower, multiple attempts may be needed.

## Tile Mechanics
- **LEDGE_HOP_RIGHT:** One-way jump from Left to Right. Blocks movement from Right to Left.
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN:** One-way jump from Up to Down. Blocks movement from Down to Up.
- **WALL:** Impassable.
- **HEADBUTT_TREE/CUT_TREE:** Impassable (unless interacting with specific move).
- **TALL_GRASS:** High encounter rate.
- **WARP_CARPET:** Transports to new map.
