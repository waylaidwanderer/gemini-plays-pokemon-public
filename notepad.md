### Current Objectives
1. **Find Floria**: Located at Route 36 (North of Route 35).
2. **Get SquirtBottle**: Return to Flower Shop (19, 1) after finding Floria.
3. **Clear Sudowoodo**: Use SquirtBottle on Route 36.

### Exploration Status
- **East Side (x>17)**: DEAD END. Blocked by walls/houses.
- **Center (x=6-17)**: Blocked by Underground Entrance (9, 5).
- **West Side (x<6)**:
  - **Radio Tower Area**: North path (x=3) is a dead end.
  - **Tracks (x=0-1)**: Potential path North? Access via Route 34 (South).
- **Navigation Note**: x=14 is isolated from x=11 by a building. Must loop South through Route 34 to access West side.

### Validated Locations
- **Flower Shop**: (19, 1).
- **Underground Entrance**: (9, 5).
- **Radio Tower**: (5, 15).
- **Gym**: (24, 7).

### Quest Log
- **Badges**: Zephyr, Hive, Plain.
- **Party**: Quilava (27), Bellsprout (6), Togepi (5), Rattata (8), Igglybuff (5).
- **West Narrow Path**: Explored (x=3, y=15). Dead end to the North.
- **Correction**: The East side and Center are dead ends. The Underground path leads South (wrong way).
- **Hypothesis**: The Train Tracks at the far West (x=0-1) might offer a path North.
- **Plan**: Exit Underground Entrance, go West to x=1, and follow tracks North.
- **Tracks**: Possible path North along the tracks (x=0-1)? Need to find access point (likely South).
