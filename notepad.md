- **Discoveries:**
    - Gyarados rampage at Lake of Rage (Gramps).
    - Mahogany Mart suspicious (Stairs locked).
    - Bug Catching Contest today.
- Fishing Guru (Lake of Rage House): Explains lake lore. Worried about Magikarp. Might need to clear Lake of Rage event first.
- Olivine Mart: No Ultra Balls.
- Fly Map Logic: Verified Azalea -> Up -> Goldenrod. Navigation is tricky.
- Goldenrod Dept Store 2F (Bottom Clerk): Sells Poke/Great Balls, but NO Ultra Balls.
- Hypothesis: Ultra Balls might be on a different floor or unlocked later? Or maybe the top clerk has them?
- Goldenrod Dept Store 2F (Top Clerk): Potions, Heals, Super Repel. No Ultra Balls.
- Plan: Check directory to see if there's another relevant floor, or move to 3F/4F/5F.
- Directory: 2F is 'Trainer's Market'.
- Plan: Checking 3F next for Ultra Balls.
- 3F (Battle Collection): Only sells X Items (Battle Stats). No Ultra Balls. Checking 4F next.
