# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- PIT: Warp tile. Falling through takes you to the floor below.
- LADDER: Warp tile. Used to travel between floors.
- BOULDER: Object. Impassable. Can be pushed with Strength.
- OBJECTS: All objects (NPCs, items, boulders) are impassable and act as walls. Defeated NPCs still occupy their tiles. (Turn 29424)
- ICE: Sliding mechanic (Ice Path).
- ROCK: Destructible with ROCK SMASH.
- WATER: Requires Surf to traverse.
- WARP: Static transition between maps/locations.
- BOULDER BRIDGES: Boulders in pits (1F 2,6; 7,6; 7,7) act as passable FLOOR.

# Strategy: Gym Leader Clair (REVISED)
- Status: Whited out Turn 29510. Party fully healed. Money: ¥4142. Inventory: 3 Full Heals.
- Preparation (Start Turn: 29511):
  1. Sell PROTEIN for funds. (In Progress)
  2. Buy as many HYPER POTIONS as possible.
  3. Teach TM27 RETURN to Calcifer.
- Battle Plan:
  1. Lead Calcifer. Use RETURN vs Dragonairs.
  2. Lower Kingdra accuracy with SMOKESCREEN immediately.
  3. Use GNEISS as secondary attacker with EARTHQUAKE.

# Blackthorn Gym Layout Theory
- Pit Destinations:
  - 2F Pit (2, 5) -> 1F (2, 6)
  - 2F Pit (8, 7) -> 1F (7, 7)
  - 2F Pit (8, 3) -> 1F (7, 6)

# Navigation Insights
- Warp Safety: 1F Entry Points (5, 6, 7) correspond to specific 2F pits. (Turn 29374)
- Isolation: Isolated map areas (like Gym Island) require indirect paths (e.g., through 2F). (Turn 29420)

# Type Effectiveness (Verified)
- Dragon resists: Fire, Water, Electric, Grass. (Verified vs Dragonair, Turn 29459)
- Kingdra (Water/Dragon) resists: Fire (1/4x), Water (1/4x), Electric (1/2x), Grass (1/2x).
- Normal & Ground: Neutral vs Dragon.
