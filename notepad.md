# Current Strategy
## Master Ball Retrieval & Roamer Hunt
- **Goal:** Retrieve Master Ball from Elm (New Bark Town).
- **Location:** Celadon City.
- **Action:** Fly Saffron -> Train -> Fly New Bark.
- **Status:** Talking to Scientist.
- **Action:** Press A.
- **Hypothesis:** Scientist might have Master Ball or info.
- **PC Note:** Lab PC unresponsive from (4,5). Access from (3,4) untested but unlikely (usually face Up).
