# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Location:** Silver Cave Outside.
- **Status:** Searching for Hidden Entrance.
- **Action:** Move Left to exit Route 28, then explore the North-West area of Silver Cave Outside.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Route 28 West was a dead end for the House.
  2. The House is in the North-West corner of Route 28.
  3. This implies a corresponding entrance in the North-West of Silver Cave Outside (or a hidden path).
  4. I will check for Cut trees or Surf paths I might have missed near the Pokemon Center or the cave entrance.

# Reflection (Turn 25341)

- **Hygiene:** Notepad updated. Map markers to be updated post-battle (failed hidden path).
- **Goals:** Catch Ponyta, then explore West Route 28.
- **Strategy:** Using Ultra Balls at full health due to level difference risk.
- **Tools:** `select_battle_option` being used. `find_path` ready for post-battle.
