# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- **Start Turn:** 48900
- **Timestamp:** Turn 49381 (Resumed)
- **Status:** Back in city at (14, 30). Executing Western Corridor path.

## Execution Plan (Refined)
1. Walk to (9, 33) to pass the X=9 wall. <- CURRENT TASK
2. Walk to (5, 35) to pass the X=5 wall.
3. Walk West to (2, 35) to enter the western corridor.
4. Walk North to (2, 14) to bypass Row 15 barriers.
5. Walk East to (8, 14), then North to (8, 10).
6. Walk East to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

## Strategy: Western Corridor Path
The northern plateau is only accessible from the far west (X=2). The city is divided by walls at X=9 and X=5. Gaps exist at (9, 33) and (5, 35). This path avoids all one-way ledges and buoy barriers.

## Tile Mechanics (Global)
- **FLOOR**: Traversable ground. No special effects.
- **WALL**: Impassable barrier.
- **WATER**: Requires Surf HM to traverse.
- **BUOY**: Impassable water barrier.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL**: One-way ledge. Blocks DOWN (South) movement. Allows UP, LEFT, and RIGHT movement. (Verified at (6, 46), (7, 34)).
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN**: One-way jump South. Impassable from the North side.
- **DOOR**: Warp entry point. Leads to a different map.
- **BOULDER**: Requires Strength HM to push.
- **ROCK**: Small smashable rock. Requires Rock Smash HM.

## Failed Hypotheses & Lessons
- Terrestrial Path (South): Blocked by ledges.
- Great Sea Bypass (Route 40): Dead end on the West.
- Inner Channel South: Blocked at Row 15 by solid buoy line (except X=23).
- Inner Channel Water Path: Entirely blocked by buoy walls (Row 9, Row 25). Must use island hop.
