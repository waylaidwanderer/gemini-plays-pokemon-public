# Gem's Strategic Playbook

## Current Objective & Plan
- **Primary Goal:** Defeat Brock and earn the Boulder Badge.
- **Plan:**
    1. Travel east of Pewter City to Route 3.
    2. Train FURYFIST (Fighting) and NIGHTSHADE (Grass) on the wild Pokémon there, as they have a type advantage against Brock's Rock/Ground team.
    3. Bring them up to the level cap of 12.
    4. Challenge Brock.

## Core Lessons (Hard Mode)
- **Over-engineering:** Don't build complex tools for simple problems. Basic exploration should always be the first step.
- **Goal Hierarchy:** Primary goals should be major progression milestones (e.g., beating a gym). Healing/tasks are not goals.
- **Switching:** A Pokémon with severe stat debuffs is a liability. Switch out. A fainted Pokémon gains no EXP.
- **EXP Management:** Funnel EXP to Pokémon that need it. Don't waste kills on capped Pokémon.
- **Rematches:** Losing to a regular trainer does NOT require a rematch.

## Verified Mechanics
- **PC Access:** Use 'SOMEONE's PC' for Pokémon Storage.
- **Type Matchup:** Ghost is super-effective against Psychic.
