- **Leader:** Bugsy (Defeated).

## Cleared Areas
- **Slowpoke Well:** Cleared. Kurt rescued.
- **Azalea Gym:** Cleared. Hive Badge earned.

## Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Acts as wall from North.
- **LEDGE_HOP_LEFT:** One-way Left.
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN:** One-way Down.
- **Rocket Grunt:** Defeated at (5, 2).
- **Kurt:** Moved to (7, 5).
- **Battle:** Rival Silver (Gastly, Croconaw, Zubat) - Defeated.
- **Info:** Youngster at (7, 28) lost his boss's Farfetch'd (which knows Cut) in the forest.
- **Task:** Herd Farfetch'd East from (15, 28) to navigate around the central wall.
## Puzzle Status: Farfetch'd Herding
- **Last Known:** (17, 23) (Before Battle).
- **Discovery:** The path East at Row 29 leads to a dead end at (22, 29). The "Big Loop" via the far East is impossible due to walls at Row 27.
- **Current Status:** Returning to (16, 29) to re-engage Farfetch'd at (15, 25).
- **Strategy Refinement:**
  1. Push Bird North to (15, 23).
  2. Force East into Loop.
  3. Maneuver to get BEHIND (North or East of) the bird within the loop (Rows 23-24).
  4. Push West/South back to the main column.
- **Strategy:** Position North at (15, 24) to push Farfetch'd South to Row 28. Then flank East to push it West towards the Apprentice.
- **Goal:** Herd to Apprentice at (7, 28).

## Farfetch'd Behavior Notes
- Moves opposite to interaction.
- Can "fly" over obstacles if cornered (e.g. corner loop).
- Resets on map exit (and possibly battles).
