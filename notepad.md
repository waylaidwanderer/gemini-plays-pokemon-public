# Strategy: Trigger Suicune Sighting (Started: Turn 51131, Turn 51301 - Resumed)
- City Logic: Vertical walls divide the city. X=12 is a key corridor for land and water travel. Row 51 is the southern highway. Gaps in the Row 46/48/50 terraces exist at X=12/13.
- Execution Plan:
  1. Use SURF at (12, 28) to enter (12, 27).
  2. Surf North to (12, 19) and land.
  3. Walk North to (12, 12).
  4. Walk East to (14, 12) and North to (14, 10).

# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard traversable tile.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable collision.
- WATER: Traversable only while using SURF.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way passage (South only). You jump FROM the ledge tile to the tile below it.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way passage (North only). You walk ONTO it from the south or walk North from it.
- ROCK (Object): Impassable until cleared with ROCK SMASH.
