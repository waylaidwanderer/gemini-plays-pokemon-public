# Strategy: Trigger Suicune Sighting (Started: Turn 51131, Turn 51354 - Resumed)
- City Logic: Vertical walls partition the city. Row 15 and Row 13 are major barriers. Gaps exist at (11, 15) and (13, 13).
- The Center Shortcut (Execution Plan):
  1. Walk North to (12, 28).
  2. Use SURF at (12, 28) to cross the inner sea; land at (12, 19).
  3. Walk to (11, 19), then North to (11, 14).
  4. Walk South to (11, 16), then East to (13, 16).
  5. Walk North to (13, 12), then East to (14, 12).
  6. Walk North to (14, 10) for the Suicune sighting.
- Battle Prep: Lead Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion).

- ROCK (Object): Impassable until cleared with ROCK SMASH.
