# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Location:** Route 28 (West End).
- **Status:** Battling Wild Rapidash (Turn 25368).
- **Action:** Use Ultra Ball (A -> A).
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Current Screen shows Bag list with Ultra Ball selected.
  2. "USE" menu is NOT visible (State 3 shows it, but Current Screen does not - trusting Current Screen).
  3. Pressing A opens menu, second A selects USE.
  4. Ultra Ball count is 9.
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Catch Rapidash.
  2. Post-battle: Delete marker at (31, 3), explore West end.

# Reflection (Turn 25341)
- **Status:** Battling Wild Ponyta on Route 28.
- **Hygiene:** Notepad updated. Map markers to be updated post-battle (failed hidden path).
- **Goals:** Catch Ponyta, then explore West Route 28.
- **Strategy:** Using Ultra Balls at full health due to level difference risk.
- **Tools:** `select_battle_option` being used. `find_path` ready for post-battle.
