# Lessons Learned
- **Inventory Check:** Always verify Inventory for Key Items before assuming they are missing. Do not rely solely on memory or previous notepad entries.
- **Ledge Mechanics:** Confirmed that pressing 'Down' at a ledge tile moves the player 2 tiles (hopping the ledge) but only consumes 1 movement input.
- **Route 8 Obstacle:** Three Bikers blocking the path at x=10 (Rows 8, 9, 10). Must defeat them to progress.
- **Route 8 Bypass:** Successfully bypassed the bikers by taking the northern path (Row 6) and hopping down the ledges at x=13 (Rows 7 and 9). This avoids the battles entirely.
- **Route 8:** Collected PRZCureBerry from tree at (33, 5).
- **Receptionist:** Just a greeter. Need to find Director elsewhere (likely upstairs).
- **Radio Tower Directory:** 1F Reception, 2F Sales, 3F Personnel, 4F Production, 5F Director.
