# Exploration Log
- **Elite Four Progress:**
  - Will: Defeated.
  - Koga: Defeated.
  - Bruno: Defeated.
  - Next: Karen.

# Plan
1.  **Champion Lance:**
    - **Lead:** Muscle (26 HP). Sacrificial lead.
    - **Matchup Reality Check:**
      - Lance's team is ALL Flying-types (Gyarados, Dragonites, Charizard, Aerodactyl).
      - **Fighting (Cross Chop) is Not Very Effective (0.5x)** on all except Aerodactyl (Neutral).
      - **Ground (Dig) is IMMUNE (0x)** on all.
      - **Normal (Strength) is Neutral (1.0x)** on all except Aerodactyl (Resisted).
    - **Strategy:** Spam **Strength**. It is my most reliable damage source (80 BP + STAB > 50 BP effective Cross Chop).
    - **Aerodactyl:** Use Gyarados (Surf) or Muscle (Cross Chop - Neutral).
    - **Zombie Mode:** Revive Muscle repeatedly. Strength spam to win.

# Battle Log
- **Vs Bruno:** Victory.
- **Vs Karen:** Victory.
- **Next:** Champion Lance.
- **Vs Lance:** Battle starting.
- **Matchup Correction:**
  - **Strength (Normal):** Neutral vs Gyarados/Dragonite/Charizard. Resisted by Aerodactyl (Rock).
  - **Cross Chop (Fighting):** Resisted by Gyarados/Dragonite/Charizard. Neutral vs Aerodactyl.
- **Plan:**
  - **General:** Strength (120 Power).
  - **Vs Aerodactyl:** Cross Chop (150 Power).
  - **Lead:** Muscle (26 HP). Expecting to faint quickly.
- **Turn 19352:** Muscle fainted to Hyper Beam.
- **Mechanic:** In Gen 2, Hyper Beam requires recharge even on KO.
- **Opportunity:** Lance's Gyarados cannot move next turn.
- **Plan:** Send in Mistral (Sacrifice). Use turn to Revive Muscle safely. Then Mistral faints -> Muscle returns.
- **Turn 19355:** In Pack menu. Scrolling down to find Revives.
- **Status:** Mistral active (Fodder). Gyarados recharging (free turn).
- **Goal:** Revive Muscle.
- **Turn 19358:** Selecting Revive (Down -> A).
- **Note:** Gyarados is recharging this turn, so Mistral is safe.
- **Next:** Confirm 'USE' and select Muscle.
- **Turn 19359:** Cursor on CANCEL. Moving Up x5 to select REVIVE.
- **Visual Confirmation:** REVIVE is visible at top of list in screenshot.
- **Action:** Select REVIVE -> Use on Muscle.
- **Note:** Gyarados recharge confirmed (Turn 19352 Hyper Beam). Mistral safe.
