# I. Game Mechanics & World Knowledge

## A. Core Gameplay (Verified)
- **Battle Style:** Set mode.
- **Items in Battle:** Prohibited.
- **Level Caps:** Active and enforced.
- **PC Interaction:** To use a PC, stand on the tile directly *below* it and face *up* before pressing 'A'.
- **Menu Navigation:** The 'B' button is the primary method for exiting/canceling out of menus.
- **Forced Sleeping Switch:** The game will force you to send out or switch to a sleeping Pokémon if no other conscious Pokémon are available. This is a mechanical exception to the strategic guideline of avoiding switching to sleeping Pokémon.

## B. Tile Mechanics & Traversal (Verified & In-Progress)
- `ground` / `grass`: Standard traversable tiles.
- `impassable` / `unknown`: Cannot be entered. Must be navigated around.
- `water`: Requires Surf to traverse.
- `ledge`: Can be jumped down (from Y-1 to Y+2 in one step), but not climbed up. Impassable from below and sides.
- `steps`: Allows movement between `ground` and `elevated_ground`.
- `elevated_ground`: Walkable ground at a different elevation, only accessible from `steps` or other `elevated_ground` tiles.
- `cleared_boulder_barrier`: Acts as a one-way ramp, allowing movement *up* from 'ground' to 'elevated_ground', but not down.
- `boulder_barrier`: Impassable tile that can be cleared by a `boulder_switch`.
- `boulder_switch`: Floor switch for boulders. Activating it changes `boulder_barrier` to `cleared_boulder_barrier`.
- `spinner_*`: Forces movement in the specified direction.
- **Boulder Pushing:** A single button press can both turn the player and push an adjacent boulder one tile. The player's position does not change during the push. Boulders CANNOT be pushed onto 'steps' tiles.
- **Context is Key:** The behavior of a specific tile type might not be universal. I must test tile mechanics in each new area rather than assuming they will always work the same way.

## C. Elite Four Mechanics (Verified)
- **Room Progression:** After defeating an Elite Four member, the northern door is unlocked by walking towards the southern entrance of the room.
- **Defeated Trainers:** Become impassable obstacles after their defeat speech.

# II. Battle Data & Strategy

## A. Type Effectiveness Chart (Verified In-Game)
- **Super Effective (2x):** Water > Rock, Ground, Fire; Electric > Water; Ground > Fire, Electric, Rock, Poison, Psychic (Hypothesized), Ground; Ice > Ground, Grass, Flying, Dragon; Flying > Fighting, Grass, Bug; Fighting > Normal, Rock, Ice; Grass > Ground, Rock, Water; Psychic > Ghost.
- **Not Very Effective (0.5x):** Normal !> Rock; Ice !> Fighting (Ice-type moves are NOT super-effective against Fighting-types); Psychic !> Psychic.
- **Immune (0x):** Normal immune to Ghost; Ground immune to Electric; Flying immune to Ground; Ghost immune to Ground.

## B. Strategic Notes & Hypotheses
- **Opponent Coverage:** Always assume opponents, especially high-level ones like the Elite Four, have coverage moves for their weaknesses. Do not rely solely on primary typing for strategy.
- **Hypothesis (Agatha's Gengar):** A fast, high-level Psychic-type is essential. My Lv36 Kadabra was too underleveled. I need a faster solution or a bulkier Pokémon that can survive Gengar's attacks.

# III. Meta-Progression & Lessons Learned

## A. Core Methodological Failures (Self-Correction Log)
- **Immediate Action Mandate (CRITICAL FAILURE):** I have repeatedly deferred documentation and tool maintenance (e.g., placing map markers) instead of performing them immediately. As an LLM, I have no 'later'; all administrative tasks MUST be performed in the current turn and take precedence over gameplay. This is a top-priority behavior to correct.
- **Confirmation Bias (Team Composition):** I assumed my team was strong enough for Agatha based on type matchups alone, ignoring the critical factor of level discrepancy and potential coverage moves. This led to a predictable loss. I must use my `team_composition_advisor` and consider all factors before the next attempt.

## B. Future Development & Task List
- **Tool Idea:** Create a `pc_pokemon_scanner` tool to parse PC screen text and automate data collection for the `team_composition_advisor`.
- **Agent Refinement:** Improve `battle_strategist_agent` prompt to be more cautious about large level gaps and more explicit about the value of sacrificial plays.
- **Map Marker Cleanup:** Delete redundant marker '🚪 From Bruno's Room' at (5, 12) on map 247 (Agatha's Room) on the next visit.
