## Strategy: Inner Channel Landing to Suicune
**Start Turn:** 48900 (Quest: Trigger Suicune Overworld Sighting)

Cianwood's internal walls and buoy lines form a maze. The Northern Plateau is only accessible by landing at the Inner Channel Landing (13, 16).

### Step-by-Step Execution Plan
1. Surf to (21, 26) to bypass the X=19 buoy wall. <- CURRENT TASK
2. Surf West to (17, 26) through the buoy gap.
3. Surf North in the inner channel to (17, 16), then West to land at (13, 16).
4. Walk to the plateau: (13, 16) -> (11, 16) -> (11, 14) -> (8, 14) -> (8, 10) -> (14, 10).
5. Trigger Suicune sighting.

## Tile Mechanics: Cianwood City
- FLOOR: Standard ground.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Surf required.
- BUOY: Impassable water barrier.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way ledge. Blocks DOWN movement. Allows UP and East-West movement. (Verified at (6, 46)).

## Navigation: Buoy Gaps
- X=26 Wall: Gap at Row 10-15.
- X=22 Wall: Gap at Row 16-24.
- X=19/18 Wall: Gap at Row 26.

## Failed Hypotheses & Lessons
- Great Sea Bypass: Route 40 is a dead end on the West.
- Row 8/18/21 Gaps: Blocked by buoys or walls. Row 26 is the only confirmed way into the inner channel.
- Terrestrial Row 52: Blocked by WATER at (23, 32). Cannot walk south along the eastern shore.

## Inventory Check
- Super Repel: 5 remaining. Last applied turn 49278. (~140 steps remaining).
- Party: Calcifer (Lv 64) leads. Ready for Eusine.
