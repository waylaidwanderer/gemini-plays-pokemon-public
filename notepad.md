# Operation: Elemental Upgrade
- **Status:** Indigo Plateau (Will's Room).
- **Plan:** Challenge Elite Four Will.
- **Opponent:** Will (Psychic Type).
- **Strategy:** Use Sneasel (Shadow Ball) and Muscle (ThunderPunch/Ice Punch for Flying/Birds). Gyarados can bite.
- **Next:** Approach Will at (5, 7) and talk.

# Team Status
- Muscle (Lv65): Cross Chop, Strength, ThunderPunch, Ice Punch.
- Support: Gyarados (Intimidate), Sneasel (Shadow Ball/Priority).

# League Preparation
- **Items:** 14 Lemonades (1120 HP), 7 Revives, 8 Full Heals, 5 Hyper Potions.
- **Strategy:** Muscle carries. Revives for emergencies. Lemonade for post-battle top-ups.
- **Money:** ¥1219 (Low funds, rely on current stock).

# General Notes
- **Mechanics:** Max Revive restores HP but NOT PP.
- **Type Matchups (Gen 2):** Ghost is Physical (Good for Sneasel/Shadow Ball). Dark is Special (Bad for Sneasel).
- **Battle:** Elite Four Will.
- **State:** Xatu defeated. Jynx incoming.
- **Matchup:** Muscle vs Jynx -> Switching to Sneasel.
- **Reasoning:** Jynx (Ice/Psychic) threatens Muscle. Sneasel (Dark/Ice) is immune to Psychic and resists Ice. Shadow Ball targets Jynx's weak Defense.
