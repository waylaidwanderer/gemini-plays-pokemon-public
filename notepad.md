## Battle Strategy
- Objective: Defeat Dragonite #3.
- Strategy: Smokescreen luck + Night Shade chip.
- Plan:
    1. Smokescreen (Done).
    2. Switch to XENON to preserve Calcifer and bait a miss.
    3. Night Shade (41 fixed) if XENON survives.
    4. Return with Calcifer to finish.
- Failed Hypothesis: Revive GNEISS (Out of items).
- Attempt Count (Smokescreen/Return): 1.
