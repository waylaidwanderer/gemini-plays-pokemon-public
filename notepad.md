## Strategy: The Grand Southern Bypass to Suicune
**Start Turn:** 48900 (Quest: Trigger Suicune Overworld Sighting)

Cianwood is a maze of ledges (FLOOR_UP_WALL) that block DOWN movement. I have identified a 100% terrestrial path that bypasses all barriers.

### Step-by-Step Execution Plan
1. Walk East to the Strip 5 gap at (24, 44). <- CURRENT TASK
2. Walk South to (24, 50) (Bypasses all vertical walls).
3. Walk West through the Row 50 gap to (2, 50) (West Beach Highway).
   - Note: FLOOR_UP_WALL tiles at (19, 50) to (12, 50) allow East-West movement.
4. Walk North along the West Beach Highway (X=2) to (2, 12).
5. Walk East along the Northern Row 12 corridor to (14, 12).
6. Walk North to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune sighting.

## Tile Mechanics: Cianwood City
- FLOOR: Standard ground.
- WALL: Impassable barrier.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way ledge. Blocks DOWN movement (Y to Y+1). Allows UP and East-West movement. (Verified at (6, 46)).

## Navigation: Landmarks
- Strip 5 (X=20-25): Clear North-South passage from Row 32 to Row 53.
- Row 50 Gap: Clear East-West passage from X=24 to X=2.
- West Beach Highway (X=2): Clear North-South passage from Row 53 to Row 14.

## Inventory Check
- Super Repel: 5 remaining. Last applied turn 49278. (On land, not needed).
