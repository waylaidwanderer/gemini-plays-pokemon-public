### Route 29 Navigation Notes
- **General Layout**: The route is divided by ledges into upper and lower lanes.
- **Lower Lane (Current Path)**: Located on Rows 16-17. Travels West towards Cherrygrove.
- **Dead Ends**:
  - Row 16 East ends at x=43 (Tree Wall).
  - Row 15/16 West ends at x=13.
  - The "Middle Section" (Rows 8-12, East of x=40) is a ledge trap; escape East via ledge at (43, 12).
  - New Bark Town Exits (0,12) and (0,13) are blocked.
- **Strategy**: The Main Path (Rows 8-16) appears to be a one-way return route from Cherrygrove. The route WEST must be on the "Northern Plateau" (Rows 4-5). I need to find the entrance to this plateau, likely in the NW corner of New Bark Town (y < 8).
- **Key Mechanics**:
  - TYPE_2889: Tree (Impassable)
  - TYPE_80fc: Ledge (One-way Jump Down)
  - TYPE_c453: Vertical Ledge (One-way Jump East)
