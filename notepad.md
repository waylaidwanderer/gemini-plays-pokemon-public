# Strategy for Primary Goal (Defeat Gym Leader Chuck)
- Observation: Poliwrath (Lv30) is very strong. Its DynamicPunch is devastating. -2 Accuracy (from Smokescreen) helped but wasn't enough for a Lv10/Lv34 team.
- Plan: Train KIMCHI (Oddish) to Lv21+ to evolve into Gloom. Deliver SecretPotion to Jasmine first to gain levels/money along the way.
- Rematch Criteria: KIMCHI at Lv25+, Calcifer at Lv36+.
