### Strategic Notes

- **Current Location**: Route 36 / National Park East (Map 10_3).
- **Goal**: Find Floria.
- **Hypothesis**: Floria is in the National Park Main Area (Map 3_15).
- **Plan**: Enter Gatehouse at (18, 9), then enter National Park Main Area to search.
- **Obstacles**: Trainer at (20, 13) blocks direct path North; must flank East.

### Reflection (Turn 11924)
- **Progress**: Navigated around obstacles on Route 36. Verified Floria is not at (31, 14).
- **Map Knowledge**: Clarified layout of Route 36 East. Discovered I cannot pass Sudowoodo yet.
- **Next Steps**: Thoroughly check National Park and Gatehouse.
