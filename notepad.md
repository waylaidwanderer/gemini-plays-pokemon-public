# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard ground. Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Surf required. Traversable.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- DOOR: Warp point.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable cliff face. Blocks movement into the face (e.g., at 6, 34 and 4, 30).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
- BREAKABLE ROCK: Requires Rock Smash. Impassable.
- NPC: Impassable. Interact from adjacent tile.

# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The Great Southern Loop (Verified Land Route)
- Plan:
  1. Walk to (12, 49). [IN PROGRESS]
  2. Walk West to (10, 49), then South through the gap at (10, 50) to (10, 51).
  3. Walk West along Row 51 to the West Beach corridor at (2, 51).
  4. Walk North along X=2 to Row 12.
  5. Walk East along Row 12 to (14, 12), then North to (14, 10).
- Status: At (4, 28), returning to the city's central artery at (12, 28).
- Reasoning: Direct northern access is completely blocked by east-west cliff walls (FLOOR_UP_WALL) at Row 30 and Row 34. The only break in the city's internal defenses is the gap at (10, 50).
