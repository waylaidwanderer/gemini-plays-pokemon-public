# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Timestamp:** Turn 25602 (Jan 6, 2026)
- **Primary Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Immediate Task:** Reach the Northwest area of Silver Cave Outside.
- **Current Location:** Route 28 (0, 13).
- **Result:** The ledge at (0, 14) is a WALL.
- **Conclusion:** Direct access to the bottom path from the West side is impossible.
- **New Plan:**
    1. Exit Route 28 to Silver Cave Outside (Left).
    2. Check if there is a second, lower entrance to Route 28 from Silver Cave Outside.
    3. If not, proceed to enter Silver Cave itself to look for a hidden path.

# Tile Mechanics & Observations
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT:** Standard one-way jumpable tiles.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Inconsistent behavior observed.
    - **Confirmed Ledge:** (39, 32) allowed jumping South.
    - **Confirmed Wall:** (6, 30) and (28, 34) blocked movement South.
    - **Strategy:** Treat as WALL unless verified otherwise.
- **Navigation Notes:**
    - The "Central" area (x=5) connects to the West path via Row 22 (re-verified via Mental Map).
    - Row 30 acts as a hard barrier across most of the map, separating the North and South sections.
