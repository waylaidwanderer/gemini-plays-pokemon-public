# Strategy: Trigger Suicune Sighting
- Plan: The Eastern Surf Route (Refined).
- Steps:
  1. Surf Down to Row 16.
  2. Surf West to (22, 16) (Gap in Column 22 buoy wall).
  3. Surf South to Row 21.
  4. Surf West to (18, 21) (Gap in Column 19 buoy wall).
  5. Surf North to (18, 10).
  6. Land at (15, 10).
  7. Walk to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.
- Battle Prep: Lead Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion).
- Note: This route avoids the solid buoy walls at Column 22 (Rows 9-15) and Column 19 (Rows 15-20). Row 21 and Row 16 are the key bypasses.

# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard traversable tile.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable collision.
- WATER: Requires SURF.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (South). Blocks North.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way climb slope. Approach from South (Up move) to climb. Impassable from North (Acts as WALL).
- BREAKABLE ROCK: Requires ROCK SMASH.
