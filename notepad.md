# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Cross the whirlpool to reach the Dragon Shrine.

# Key Mechanics & Lessons
- **Field Moves:** If 'A' interaction fails (even when facing correctly), ALWAYS fallback to Menu -> Pokemon -> [Mon] -> [Move].
- **Whirlpool:** Requires facing the whirlpool tile directly. 'A' button might be unreliable; Menu is safer.

- Status: Correcting Orientation for Whirlpool.
- Reason: Game State indicates 'Facing: up', but Whirlpool is below. Previous attempts to face down failed likely due to menu interaction timing.
- Step 1: Close Menu (B).
- Step 2: Face Down (Down).
- Step 3: Open Menu and Select Whirlpool (Start -> Pokemon...).
