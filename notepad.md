## III. Area & Navigation Insights

### Tile Traversal Rules (Verified)
- **Objects are impassable:** All map objects (items, trees, signs, defeated trainers etc.) act as walls.
- **WALL:** Impassable.
- **FLOOR:** Traversable.
- **TALL_GRASS:** Traversable, triggers wild encounters.
- **LEDGE:** One-way downward traversal.
- **FLOOR_HOP_*_LEDGE:** One-way traversal in the specified direction.
- **COUNTER:** Impassable.
- **DOOR/CAVE:** Warp tile, triggered by movement.
- **MART_SHELF/BOOKSHELF/TV/RADIO/PC/TOWN_MAP/WINDOW/PAINTING:** Impassable scenery.
- **WATER/CUT_TREE/BUOY:** Impassable.
- **PILLAR:** Impassable.
- **VOID:** Impassable.
- **WARP_CARPET_*: Warp tile, direction-specific.
- **FRUIT_TREE:** Impassable object, may yield items.
- **LADDER:** A two-way warp tile, triggered by movement (not by pressing 'A').
- **STATUE:** An impassable scenery object.

### Sprout Tower Layout
- The central pillar divides all floors, making east-west travel impossible on any single floor except the third.
- To navigate the tower, one must ascend on one side, cross over on the third floor, and then descend on the other.

## IV. Future Plans & Untested Hypotheses

- **Hypothesis:** Can Onix learn Flash (HM05)?
- **Current Objective Plan:** My previous attempts to exit Sprout Tower via the eastern side have failed. The new plan is to thoroughly explore the western side of the third floor to find the correct exit path. I will start by exploring the northern section.
