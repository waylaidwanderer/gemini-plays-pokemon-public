## Suicune Quest (Started Turn 49107)
- Goal: Trigger Suicune sighting at (14, 10).
- Strategy: Land at the northern beach (Row 18-19) and walk to (14, 10).

## Plan: Reach Suicune at (14, 10)
- Step 1: RUN from battle at (12, 21). <- CURRENT TASK
- Step 2: Land at (12, 19) (FLOOR) or (11, 21) (FLOOR).
- Step 3: Walk to (14, 10) via the following path:
  (12, 19) -> (12, 16) -> (11, 16) -> (11, 13) -> (13, 13) -> (13, 12) -> (14, 12) -> (14, 10).

## Verified Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Requires Surf.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable cliff face.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
- BUOY: Impassable hard wall.

## Navigation Insights
- Northern Landing (12, 18-19): Clear land area accessible from the water channel.
- Row 15 Bypass: (11, 15) is FLOOR, allowing movement north past the (12, 15) WALL.
- Gym Blockade: Building at (10, 40) is bypassed by the water channel (X=12-17).
- Ledge (10, 15): One-way jump DOWN. Stay at X >= 11 to avoid it.
