# Navigation Plan: Silver Cave Room 1
1. Toss BERRY to free space.
2. Collect Protein at (15, 29) by going around the far right corridor (X=19).
3. Head to (1, 35) then (0, 34) to access the left corridor (X=0) to reach the upper level.
4. Collect item at (7, 18).

# Inventory Management
- Bag capacity: 20 slots in the Items pocket.
- To free a slot, the entire stack must be tossed or used.
- Task Started: Turn 43296. Current Turn: 43350. Goal: Toss BERRY. Accidentally opened Pokedex; closing it now.

# Turn 43349 Correction
- Turn mismatch detected: Turn 43342 -> 43348 (6 turns) instead of 1.
- Reason: menu_navigator sequence likely failed. I am at (11, 21) facing Up.
- Refined Plan: Move Down to (11, 22), ensure menu is closed with B, then open menu and select PACK.
