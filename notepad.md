# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Timestamp:** Turn 25602 (Jan 6, 2026)
- **Primary Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Immediate Task:** Reach the Northwest area of Silver Cave Outside.
- **Current Location:** Route 28 (21, 15). West Bank.
- **Insight:** The "Ledge" at Row 16 is a wall. I cannot jump it.
- **New Lead:** The unseen tiles at (37, 12) suggest a path on the far East edge.
- **Plan:**
    1. Surf East to the gap at (28, 11).
    2. Enter the East Enclave.
    3. Explore South-East (x=29+, y=12+) to find the path to x=37.
    4. Follow the perimeter to the NW House.

# Tile Mechanics & Observations
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT:** Standard one-way jumpable tiles.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Inconsistent behavior observed.
    - **Confirmed Ledge:** (39, 32) allowed jumping South.
    - **Confirmed Wall:** (6, 30) and (28, 34) blocked movement South.
    - **Strategy:** Treat as WALL unless verified otherwise.
- **Navigation Notes:**
    - The "Central" area (x=5) connects to the West path via Row 22 (re-verified via Mental Map).
    - Row 30 acts as a hard barrier across most of the map, separating the North and South sections.
