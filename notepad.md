# Strategy: Suicune Hunt (Crystal)
- Sequence: 1. Burned Tower -> 2. Cianwood -> 3. Route 42 (Current) -> 4. Route 36 -> 5. Route 38 -> 6. Route 14 -> 7. Tin Tower 1F.
- Quest Start: Turn 20970 (Dec 25, 5:00 PM)
- Logic: Scripted sightings (1-5) are overworld events. Suicune remains stationary until approached.
- Battle Strategy (Tin Tower): Lead XENON (GASTLY). Use MEAN LOOK, HYPNOSIS, NIGHT SHADE.
- Note: Suicune was not found on Route 42 island clearing despite Pokedex showing it on Route 42. Pivoting to Route 36 to verify prerequisites.
