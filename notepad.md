## Key Discoveries & Lessons Learned
- **Dialogue Triggers:** "The Tin Tower shook!" is the definitive narrative flag that all overworld sightings (Burned Tower, Cianwood, Route 42, Route 36) are complete.
- **Sequential Requirements:** Clear Bell + Sightings -> "Shook" dialogue -> Wise Trio Battle -> Suicune Encounter.
- **NPC Solidity:** NPCs are solid objects; paths must detour around them.
- **Map Transitions:** Leaving a map from specific coordinates triggers transitions (e.g., Ecruteak (18, 11) -> Tin Tower Gatehouse).
- Talked to Sage (Passage Guard) at (4, 6). He said: "Please, do go on." (Turn 27070)
- Talked to Gramps at (4, 12). He said: "Two towers… Two POKéMON… But when one burned down, both POKéMON flew away, never to return." (Turn 27081)
