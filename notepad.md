# Suicune Capture Strategy
## Strategy: The Mean Look Pivot
1. Catch a Gastly in Sprout Tower (Night only, Lv 3-6).
2. Train Gastly to Lv 13 to learn Mean Look.
3. Evolve to Haunter (Lv 25) to ensure Base 95 Speed (Suicune is Base 85). Haunter needs to be faster than Suicune to use Mean Look before it flees.
4. Track Suicune using Pokedex AREA map.
5. Lead with Haunter: Mean Look (Turn 1) -> Hypnosis -> Great Balls.

## Game Mechanics & Verified Lessons
- Ghost-type Immunities: Normal and Fighting-type moves (like Lick) do not affect Normal/Fighting types (wait, Lick is Ghost, it doesn't hit Normal).
- Ghost-type Resistances: Leech Life is "not very effective" against Ghost types.
- Accuracy/Status: Supersonic (and other status moves) can miss regardless of type, but Ghost types are NOT immune to Supersonic (hallucination corrected: it's just an accuracy check/luck).
- Sweet Scent: Triggers immediate encounters on valid tiles. "Nothing here" means safe tile.

## Sprout Tower Analysis
- Layout: Middle section (x=5 to x=14) is isolated. Access outer ring via 2F ladders.
- Encounters: FLOOR tiles at (14, 6), (10, 11), and (14, 10) are safe zones. (6, 5) on 2F is a valid encounter tile.

## Training Plan: XENON
- Goal: Train XENON to Lv 13 (Mean Look) then Lv 25 (Haunter).
- Current Progress: Lv 8.

## Route 32 Observations
- Ledge at (14, 6): Jumpable south.
- Slowpoketail Scam: NPC at (11, 67) tries to sell a tail for ¥1,000,000. Verified dead end/scam.
