# Current Status
- **Status:** On Route 25 (East End).
- **Location:** (54, 8).
- **Goal:** Check the Northern Cape (Row 4) for Misty.
- **Action:** Backtrack West to (40, 6), then Up to Row 4, then East to the Cape.

# Quest Logic (Cascade Badge)
1. **Hypothesis:** Misty appears at the Cape only *after* the Power Plant quest.
2. **Test:** Check Cape now. If empty, proceed to Power Plant.
3. **Sequence:**
    - Power Plant (Talk to Manager).
    - Cerulean Gym (Rocket Event).
    - Route 24 (Defeat Rocket).
    - Gym (Find Part).
    - Power Plant (Return Part).
    - Cape (Find Misty).

# Tile Mechanics
- **Row 5 Wall:** Blocks access to Cape from South.
- **Access Point:** Gap at (40, 5) or Cut Tree at (34, 6). Gap is closer.

# Key Locations
- **Cape (Route 25):** Northern strip (Row 4).
- **Power Plant:** East of Cerulean (Route 9).
