# Current Strategy: Defeat Red
- **Start Turn:** 26776 (Jan 7, 2026)
- **Location:** Silver Cave Room 3 (3_76)
- **Status:** In Battle with Red.
- **Active Matchup:** Muscle (Lv 83) vs Espeon (Lv 73).
- **Goal:** Defeat Red.
- **Battle Plan:**
  - **Action:** Use **Cross Chop**.
    - **Reasoning:** Espeon has low Defense. Cross Chop (Fighting, STAB) is Physical. Even with 80% accuracy, it's the best chance to OHKO before Espeon can use Psychic.
    - **Backup:** If Cross Chop misses or fails to kill, and Muscle survives, heal or try again. If Muscle faints, use Mistral/Belladonna as fodder to Revive Muscle.
  - **Next Opponents:** Snorlax, Venusaur, Charizard, Blastoise.
- **Items:** 15 Full Restores, 19 Revives.

# Key Findings
- **Silver Cave:** Room 2 Warp (11, 5) led directly to Room 3 (Red's Chamber), not Item Rooms.
