# Mechanics & State
- **Fly Mechanics:** Blocked on door mats (29,4). Safe spot: (30,6).
- **Location:** Cherrygrove City (29, 4). Moving to (30, 6).
- **Menu:** Cursor Memory on Pokemon -> Mistral -> Fly.
- **Map Navigation:** Cherrygrove -> Violet is likely `Up` + `Left`.
- **Previous Failure:** Only pressed `Up`. Likely landed on Route 30 (not flyable) or cursor didn't move far enough. Landed back in Cherrygrove.

# Strategy
1. Move to (30, 6).
2. Fly Sequence: Start -> Pokemon -> Mistral -> Fly.
3. Map Navigation: Up -> Left -> A. (Target: Violet City).
4. If successful, we leave Cherrygrove.
