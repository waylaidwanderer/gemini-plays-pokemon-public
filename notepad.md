# Lessons Learned
- Blackthorn Maze: Southern walls at Row 32, 34 are hard barriers from the North. Resetting to high ground requires using specific gaps (e.g., col 13 at Row 23).
- Strip Isolation: Route 45 Strip 5 is isolated at Row 35. Must enter from Blackthorn x=15-18.
- Menu Verification: Always check the current screen before executing long button sequences.
