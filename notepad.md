- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN:** One-way Down.
- **Rocket Grunt:** Defeated at (5, 2).

- **Info:** Youngster at (7, 28) lost his boss's Farfetch'd (which knows Cut) in the forest.
- **Task:** Herd Farfetch'd East from (15, 28) to navigate around the central wall.
## Puzzle Status: Farfetch'd Herding
- **Current Status:** Bird returned. Apprentice dialogue exhausted.
- **Position Correction:** System places player at (4, 29). Image conflicts (6, 29).
- **Action:** Navigate to (5, 29) to talk to the Black Belt (potential Boss).
- **Hypothesis:** Black Belt at (5, 28) may have the HM or be the Boss.
- **Next Steps:**
    1.  Talk to Black Belt.
    2.  If successful, return to Azalea Town.
    3.  If not, check Ilex Forest exit or return to town to find Charcoal Master.

## Reflection Log (Turn 2549)
- **Review:** Last 50 turns focused on herding. No major deferrals.
- **Hygiene:** Notepad covers puzzle state well. Map markers used for tracking bird.
- **Strategy:** Manual herding is effective. Bird flees large distances occasionally; need to be ready to chase.
- **Lesson:** Farfetch'd behavior includes "fleeing" phases where it moves multiple tiles. Deflection logic (wall bounce) seems consistent.
- **Action:** Proceeding with "Corner and Deflect North" strategy.

## Farfetch'd Behavior Notes
- Moves opposite to interaction.
- Can "fly" over obstacles if cornered (e.g. corner loop).
- Resets on map exit (and possibly battles).
- **Info:** Oddish caught (sent to PC). Nickname: BELLADONNA.
- **Task:** Retrieve Oddish from PC after getting HM01.
## Puzzle Status: Farfetch'd Herding
- **Current Status:** Nicknaming complete. Returning to Overworld.
- **Immediate Task:** Clear "Sent to PC" text (if any) and locate Farfetch'd.
- **Assumption:** Farfetch'd is likely still at (18, 29) or nearby.
- **Goal:** Herd Farfetch'd West to (7, 28).
- **Info:** Wade called (Tuesday). Bug Catching Contest is active at National Park.
- **Immediate Task:** Clear "Sent to PC" text and resume Farfetch'd pursuit.
- **Bird Status:** Verify if battle reset the bird's position. Anticipate it near (18, 29).
