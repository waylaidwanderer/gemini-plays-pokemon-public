# Pokemon & Party Information
## Training Session (Route 45)
- Goal: Kimchi (Lv33) and Xenon (Lv36) to Lv40.
- Method: Kimchi holds Exp. Share. Lead Xenon.

## Strategy for Gym Leader Clair
- Clair's Team: Dragonair x3 (Lv37), Kingdra (Lv40).
- Type Matchups: Dragon resists Fire, Water, Electric, Grass. Kingdra (Water/Dragon) is only weak to Dragon.
- Tactical Plan:
  - Lead Xenon: Use Hypnosis and Confuse Ray to disable. Night Shade for consistent 36 damage.
  - Gneiss: High physical bulk. Use Strength/Earthquake. Earthquake hits hard but Dragonairs resist it? No, Dragon doesn't resist Ground.
  - Calcifer: High level advantage. Return for neutral damage. Thunderpunch is ineffective against Kingdra/Dragonairs due to resists.
