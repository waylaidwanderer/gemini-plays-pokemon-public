# Suicune Capture Strategy
## Strategy: The Mean Look Pivot
- Train XENON (Gastly) to Lv 13 to learn Mean Look.
- Evolve to Haunter (Lv 25) and train to ~Lv 38-40. Haunter needs to be faster than Suicune to use Mean Look before it flees; Lv 38-40 ensures we outspeed Suicune's potential 73-110 Speed range.
- Track Suicune using Pokedex AREA map. Force movement by cycling between two adjacent routes (e.g., Route 36 and Route 37) until it appears on your current route.
- Lead with Haunter: Mean Look (Turn 1) -> Hypnosis -> Great Balls.
- Status Requirement: Status conditions are mandatory for Suicune.
- Item Goal: Upgrade to Ultra Balls (2.0x multiplier) at Goldenrod or Blackthorn Marts.
- Contingency: If Hypnosis fails, consider switching to KIMCHI (Gloom) for Sleep Powder (75% accuracy in Gen 2).

## Game Mechanics & Lessons
- Ghost-type Moves: Lick (Ghost) does not affect Normal types. It is neutral against Grass/Flying (Hoppip).
- Ghost-type Resistances: Leech Life (Bug) is "not very effective" against Ghost types.
- Accuracy/Status: Status moves like Supersonic can hit Ghost types (not immune).
- Status Moves: "It didn't affect" is the message for a miss or blocked status move (e.g. Hypnosis missing Wooper).
- Switching: Clears confusion and resets stat changes.
- Sweet Scent: Triggers immediate encounters on valid grass tiles.
- Menu Behavior:
    - Start Menu (8 items): FULLY WRAPS. Navigate relatively. Resets to POKEDEX (1) after battle.
    - Party Menu (7 items: 1-6 + CANCEL): FULLY WRAPS. Navigate relatively. REMEMBERS last selection even when closed/reopened.
    - PKMN Pop-up Menu (variable size): WRAPS. For KIMCHI (2 field moves), it has 7 items: 1.SWEET SCENT, 2.CUT, 3.STATS, 4.SWITCH, 5.MOVE, 6.ITEM, 7.CANCEL.
    - Battle Move Menu (4 items): WRAPS.

## Training Plan: XENON
- Goal: Reach Lv 13 (1261 Total EXP).
- Progress: 1171 EXP (90 EXP remaining).
- Method: Use Sweet Scent at (18, 15) grass patch on Route 32.
- Strategy: Use Lick against Gastly and Bellsprout. RUN from Normal-types (Rattata, Hoothoot, Pidgey) and low-EXP targets (Zubat) to conserve PP and health.
- PP Management: XENON has low Lick PP (30). Return to Pokecenter or use Ether/Berry when Lick PP < 5.
- Maintenance: Heal with Fresh Water/Lemonade when HP < 10.
