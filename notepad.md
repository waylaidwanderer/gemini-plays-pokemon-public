# Roamer Hunt Strategy
- **Goal:** Catch Raikou & Entei.
- **Current Plan:** Shuffle Roamers between Route 36 & Violet City.
- **Status:** Pursuit (Route 31).
- **Recent:** Swapped Lugia to Lead (Turn 37055). Roamer was on Rt 31 (Turn 37045).
- **Plan:** Enter Route 31 and check Map.
- **Method:** Close Gear (B, B) -> Right (Violet). Next turn: Left (Rt 36).
- **Method:** Use Pokegear Map (reliable) instead of Pokedex Area Mode.
- **Resources:** 16 Repels.
- **Session Start:** Turn 36369. Current: 36900.

# Lessons Learned
- **Roamer Movement:** Gatehouse transitions (e.g. Rt 35) do NOT shuffle roamers. Map-to-Map (Route to City) transitions DO shuffle.
- **Pokedex Tracking:** Area Mode search is cumbersome and failed to list Entei despite 'Seen' status. Pokegear Map is superior.
- **Tile Mechanics:** Warp Tiles require stepping OFF and ON. Headbutt Trees can be shaken.
- **Menu Navigation:** Start Menu wraps. 'Gear' is best accessed by memory or visual check.

# Fly Map Connections
- **New Bark Town** -> Left -> **Cherrygrove City**
- **Cherrygrove City** -> Up -> **Violet City**
- **Cherrygrove City** -> Left -> **Azalea Town**
- **Azalea Town** -> Up -> **Goldenrod City**
- **Goldenrod City** -> Up -> **Olivine City**
- **Olivine City** -> Down -> **Ecruteak City** [Confirmed]
- **Action:** Switch Lugia to Lead (Slot 1) for speed advantage against Roamers.
- **Missing:** Mean Look/Spider Web trapper. Strategy is "Chip and Chase" with Lugia.
- **Observation:** Entering Route 31 Gatehouse.
- **Hypothesis:** Entering the Gatehouse (Map 10_X) from Violet City (Map 10_5) does NOT shuffle roamers (or counts as a safe transition).
- **Test:** Check roamer position after entering Gatehouse.
