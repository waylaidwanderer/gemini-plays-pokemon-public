# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Current Objectives
1. **Find Floria**: Search for her on Route 36 near the Sudowoodo.
2. **Get SquirtBottle**: Return to Flower Shop (19, 1) after finding Floria.
3. **Clear Sudowoodo**: Use SquirtBottle on Route 36.

### Route 35 / North Exit Exploration
- **Location**: North end of Route 35 (Map 3_15).
- **Structure**: National Park Gatehouse at (25, 2).
- **Current Status**: Investigating the path running West behind the gatehouse/trees (Row 2).
- **Goal**: Find entrance to National Park or Sudowoodo.

### Validated Locations
- **Flower Shop**: (19, 1).
- **Underground Entrance**: (9, 5).
- **Radio Tower**: (5, 15).
- **Gym**: (24, 7).
- **Sticker Girl**: Route 36 (15, 24). Not Floria.

### Quest Log
- **Badges**: Zephyr, Hive, Plain.
- **Party**: Quilava (27), Bellsprout (6), Togepi (5), Rattata (8), Igglybuff (5).
- **West Narrow Path**: Explored (x=3, y=15). Dead end to the North.
- **Correction**: The East side and Center are dead ends. The Underground path leads South (wrong way).
- **Hypothesis**: The Train Tracks at the far West (x=0-1) might offer a path North.
### Navigation Strategy: Route 36
- **Layout**: Route 36 extends Westward.
- **Building**: A structure is located at (2, 26).
- **Plan**: Investigate the building at (2, 26). It might be the gate to National Park.
- **Sudowoodo**: Should be nearby, possibly blocking a path.
### Tile Mechanics
- **Walkable**: `TYPE_3fe2` (Grass), `TYPE_3f8d` (Tall Grass), `TYPE_fed7` (Forest/Bush - Walkable)
- **Obstacle**: `TYPE_2889` (Tree/Fence/Building)

### Quest Progress
- **Find Floria**: Started ~Turn 10589.
- **Route 36 Layout**: Gatehouse is at South end (y=48). Main road appears to be North (y=20-30). I likely overshot South.
- **Plan**: Talk to Alan, then head North to find the East-West road and the Sudowoodo.
- **Reflection (Turn 10735)**: The nook at (14, 5) is a dead end. Confirmed by Schoolboy NPC. Exiting South to search the Western area (x < 14) for the main road or Floria. My previous assumption about the North path was wrong.
- **Sign**: "National Park Warden's Office" at (26, 31).
- **Turn 10964**: Entered the structure at the North end of Route 35 (25, 2). Appears to be the National Park Gatehouse. Heading North to exit.
