# Strategy: The Suicune Pursuit
- **Objective:** Trigger Suicune sighting at (14, 10) in northern Cianwood.
- **Eusine Battle Prep:** Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25). Strategy: Lead with Lv64 Calcifer. Sweep with Flamethrower/Thunderpunch.
- **Current Plan (Cianwood Navigation):**
  1. Currently at (28, 44) on WATER.
  2. Attempt Sea Bypass: Surf North to Row 8, then West past buoy line at X=22.
  3. If Sea Bypass fails (buoy wall), land at (27, 44) and execute Grand Loop to X=2 corridor.
  4. Sighting at (14, 10).
- **Verification:** Row 8 gap at X=23-25 is the target bypass point.
- **Land Route:** Row 23 wall at X=3-5 blocks X=4 corridor, but X=2 corridor is open at Row 23.

# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Standard traversable terrain.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable terrain.
- WATER: Traversable only with Surf.
- DOOR / WARP_CARPET: Map transition points.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump down (South). Blocks North.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL (Terrace Climb): One-way barrier. Allows North movement, blocks South.
- ROCK (Object): Blocks movement; cleared with Rock Smash. Respawns upon map transition.

# Area Notes: Cianwood City
- **Barriers:** Row 15 is a solid wall/buoy barrier from X=3 to X=22, EXCEPT for a gap at (11, 15). Row 13 is solid at X=11, making (11, 15) a dead end.
- **Shortcut Tiles:** (5, 29), (4, 25) (Smashed Rocks).
- **Terrace Climbs:** (4, 30), (6, 34), (6, 46), (21, 46), (8, 48), (12, 50). All block South movement.

# Lessons Learned
- **Time Check:** Attempting sighting since Turn #50620.
- **Verification:** X=2 corridor confirmed clear of Terrace Climbs and Ledges in Mental Map.
