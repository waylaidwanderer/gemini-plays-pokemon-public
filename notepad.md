- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. One-way ledge jumping South. Found at (10, 15).
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- Start Turn: 49771
- Start Time: 3:29 PM

## Strategy: The Great Southern Loop (v3)
The city is a maze. The Western Corridor (X=0-2) is the ONLY path to the plateau, but is only reachable from the southern clearway (Row 51). The central city ledges block southward land travel. Row 34/35 are unreachable from the east due to the X=9 wall.
1. Walk to (23, 32). (In Progress)
2. Surf South to Row 51.
3. Land at (23, 51) or (24, 51).
4. Walk West along Row 51 to (2, 51).
5. Walk North through the corridor to (2, 10).
6. Walk East along Row 10 to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune sighting.

# Progress Notes
- Verified: FLOOR_UP_WALL blocks entry from the North (Turn 49811).
- Verified: Row 34 (X=2-5) is a clear corridor to the Western Corridor.
- Note: Out of Repels. No wild encounters on land in the city.
- Hypothesis: (14, 10) is the trigger point for the Suicune sighting.
- Hypothesis: FLOOR_UP_WALL is passable from South to North. (Testing at (8, 34)).
