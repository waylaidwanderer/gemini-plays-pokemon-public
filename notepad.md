  3. **Goal:** Confirm if he checks mail ("This MAIL isn't for me") or is generic.

     - If "This MAIL isn't for me": He is the recipient but mail is wrong.

## Mechanics Notes
- **Fly Map:** Navigation is list-based via `Up`/`Down`. Order: New Bark -> Cherrygrove -> Violet -> Azalea -> Goldenrod.
- **Menu Cursor:** Remember position! Always reset or verify.

### Reflection (Turn 8681)
- **Execution:** Addressed "Cursor Memory" issues by resetting via Start Menu. Debugged Fly Map navigation step-by-step.
- **Notepad:** Cleaned up obsolete typing logs. Recorded Fly Map list logic.
- **Lesson:** When blind inputs fail, STOP and verify with screen text. Do not assume standard grid navigation.
