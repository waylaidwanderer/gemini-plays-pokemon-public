Fly Strategy: v23.0. Attempt #23. Logic: Start menu resets to Slot 1 (POKEDEX). Party menu persists (starts on Slot 5 GORP). Sequence: B(x5) -> Right -> Start -> Down (POKEMON) -> A -> Down (ICARUS Slot 6) -> A -> Reset Sub (Up x5) -> A (FLY) -> sleep -> Left x25 -> A -> sleep -> A -> sleep -> A. Total Fly failures: 22. Current Turn: #51050. Goal: Cianwood (14, 10). Prep: Calcifer in lead. Focus: SUICUNE sighting. Logic: 22 failures necessitated a precision operation based on confirmed menu behaviors.
