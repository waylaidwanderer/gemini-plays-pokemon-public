# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Current Objectives
1. **Find Floria**: Located at Route 36 (North of Route 35).
2. **Get SquirtBottle**: Return to Flower Shop (19, 1) after finding Floria.
3. **Clear Sudowoodo**: Use SquirtBottle on Route 36.

### Critical Contradiction
- **Critique Claim**: Row 0 tiles at x=18 and x=20 are Walkable. Route 35 Exit is next to Flower Shop.
- **My XML Data**: Row 0 tiles at x=18 and x=20 are Walls (`TYPE_2889`). Row 0 tiles at x=14, 15, 16 and x=23-26 are Walkable.
- **My Situation**: I am at (18, 2). To the North is (18, 1) Wall. To the Left is (17, 2) Wall. To the Right is (19, 2) Flower Shop.
- **Deduction**: Either the XML is misleading (Door marked as Wall?), or I am missing a hidden path.
- **Plan**: Test the "Walls" around the Flower Shop (18, 1), (20, 1), and the side (17, 2).

### Validated Routes
- **Flower Shop**: CONFIRMED at Goldenrod City (19, 1).
- **Floria's Sister's House**: Goldenrod City (29, 5).
- **Underground**: Connects South (11, 29) to North (9, 5).

- **Party**: Quilava (27), Sentret (2), Bellsprout (6), Togepi (5), Rattata (8), Igglybuff (5).
