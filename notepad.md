# Long Term Notes
## Lessons Learned
- **Tool Insight:** `navigate_menu` requires `hold_ms` >= 300 for Fly Map.
- **Efficiency:** Super Repels (2.5 ¥/step) are cheaper than Max Repels (2.8 ¥/step).
- **Mechanics:** Phone calls can occur on map transitions.
- **Fly Map Mechanics:** Vertical movement (Up/Down) is often more reliable than Left/Right for traversing regions. Cursor movement can be granular/slow.

## Legendary Beast Hunt Strategy
- **Target:** Raikou (#238) & Entei (#239).
- **Method:** Blind Hunt Loop (Route 37 <-> Ecruteak).
- **Tactics:** Enter Rt 37 -> Grass (Down x2, Wiggle) -> If none, Return to Ecruteak -> Repeat.

## Tile Mechanics
- GRASS: Traversable, encounters.
- FLOOR/DOOR/STAIRS: Traversable.
- WALL/OBSTACLES: Impassable.
- WARP_CARPET: Transition.
- WATER: Surfable.

# Current Strategy
## Objectives
- **Primary:** Complete Pokedex.
- **Secondary:** Resume Roaming Beast Hunt.
- **Tertiary:** Access Ruins of Alph via Rock Smash.

## Exploration Queue
- **Mahogany Town:** West edge (x=0-2) and East edge (x=15, y=3) unseen tiles.
- **Ecruteak City:** Northern edges and Barrier Station area (27, 11).
- **Route 37:** Eastern edge (x>13) unseen tiles.

## Missing Items
- **TM08 Rock Smash:** Obtained. Learned by Garnet (Quilava).

## Session Information
- **Current Location:** New Bark Town (Accidental Fly).
- **Goal:** Fly to Ecruteak City (Correctly this time).
- **Menu Navigation:** Be deliberate. Verify cursor position before pressing A, especially in sub-menus like Party -> Fly.
- **Gen 2 Mechanics:** 'Fly' option appears at the top of the Pokemon sub-menu if usable in the field.
- **Correction:** Pokegear is for Map viewing only; Fly is a Party menu action.
- **Fly Map Observation:** Cursor movement is granular (pixel-based). Requires holding the direction button (simulated by repeated inputs) to move effectively between cities. 'Left' from Violet to Ecruteak requires significant hold time.
- **Hunt Strategy:** Moving south to Route 37 grass. Will apply Super Repel if encounters become frequent to filter for Lv40 Beasts.
- **Map Connection:** Ecruteak (17, 35) leads directly South to Route 37.
