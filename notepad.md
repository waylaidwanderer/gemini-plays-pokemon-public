# Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Acts as a South-facing Ledge (verified). Blocks North movement.
- **Maze Solution:** Access the North-East section by crossing the top corridor at Row 4.
- **Navigation Notes:**
    - Rows 8, 14, 20, 26, 34 all have ledges blocking North movement in various places.
    - The gap at (8, 7) is the primary "up" ladder for this section.
    - x=14 corridor is accessible from the top (Row 6).
