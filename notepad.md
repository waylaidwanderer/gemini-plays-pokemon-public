# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Location:** Route 28 (West End).
- **Status:** Battling Wild Rapidash (Duplicate).
- **Action:** Press B to exit Pack.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. I already caught a Rapidash ("Blitz") in the previous encounter.
  2. This is a duplicate.
  3. Catching and nicknaming takes too long.
  4. Muscle (Lv 83) should be faster than Rapidash (Lv 40), ensuring a safe Run.
  5. Exiting Pack to access RUN option.
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Escape battle.
  2. Resume plan to exit Route 28 West and find the correct path to the House.
