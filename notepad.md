### Objectives
1. **Primary**: Go to Route 34 (South).
2. **Secondary**: Get SquirtBottle.
3. **Tertiary**: Find Route 35 Gatehouse (North).

### Navigation Notes (Goldenrod)
- **North Exit Puzzle**: The path to Route 35 is blocked by complex walls.
  - **Center (Flower Shop)**: Blocked at Row 1.
  - **West (Radio Tower)**: Dead end.
  - **East (Gym)**: Blocked at Row 6-19.
  - **Far East**: Need to find a crossover point. Row 5 looks promising but access is tricky.
- **Strategy**: Exiting South to Route 34 first.

### Key Locations
- **Flower Shop**: (19, 1). Needs Sudowoodo interaction.
- **Route 34 Exit**: South edge of map (Row 35).

### Quests
- **Route 35 Gatehouse**: Deliver Mail (Randy).
- **Sudowoodo**: Route 36 (North).

### Status
- Badges: 3 (Zephyr, Hive, Plain).
- Party: Quilava (26), Sentret (2), Bellsprout (6), Togepi (5), Rattata (8).
- Route 34 Navigation: To reach the Daycare, travel North along the West path (main road) and enter the yard through the gap in the fence at (11, 15). Watch out for the Officer at (10, 16).
- Navigation Target: North Exit of Goldenrod (approx 16, 0).
- Pathing: The main road seems blocked by buildings at Row 5. Use the gap at x=18 (East side) to bypass the wall, then head North. Once past y=5, move West to align with the exit at x=16.
- Received Odd Egg (Turn 7045). Contains unknown Pokemon (fingers crossed for a shiny!).
