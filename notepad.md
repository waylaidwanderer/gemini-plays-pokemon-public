# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Current Task
- **Map 4_9**: Ecruteak City.
- **Goal**: Defeat Morty at Ecruteak Gym (6, 27).
- **Status**: Legendary Beasts released. Team healed. Garnet (Lv 32) should sweep with Mud-Slap/Flame Wheel.
- **Gym Strategy**: The gym has an invisible floor maze. Must follow the correct path to reach Morty.
- **Team**: Garnet is the carry. Mud-Slap is super effective vs Ghost/Poison. Flame Wheel is backup.

- **Map 3_13**: Tile (15, 4) is a BREAKABLE ROCK (impassable), despite being TYPE_3fe2. BFS will fail here. Go around via the Left side (Col 4).
- **Map 3_13**: Item at (14, 2) is blocked by Breakable Rock at (15, 4). Requires Rock Smash.
- **Exploration**: Checking bottom-right area (Cols 14-16) before leaving.
- **Reflection (Turn 14208)**: 
  - Progress: Healed team, taught Rock Smash. Now back in Burned Tower.
  - Plan: Smash rock at (15, 4) to access East side/Item. Avoid hole at (7, 15).
  - Hypothesis: Rock Smash opens path to new area or item. Beasts might be elsewhere (B1F center).
- **Loot**: Found HP Up at (14, 2) in Burned Tower 1F.
- **Mapping**: Warp/Hole located at (10, 9) in Burned Tower 1F. Expecting drop to B1F center.
- **Achievement**: Released the Legendary Beasts (Raikou, Entei, Suicune) from Burned Tower B1F.
- **Mapping**: Ladder to 1F located at (7, 15) in Burned Tower B1F.
