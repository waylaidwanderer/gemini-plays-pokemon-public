# Roamer Tracking Data
- Raikou/Entei Neighbors: Route 42 (2_5) connects to Ecruteak City (1_3) and Mahogany Town (2_4).

# Suicune Tracking & Strategy
- Status: Investigating (Scripted vs. Roaming).
- Sightings: Burned Tower (fled), Cianwood City (fled).
- Current Objective: Verify Suicune's location and encounter type.
- Strategy (if Roaming): Grind in tall grass with XENON (Gastly) leading for Mean Look/Hypnosis.
- Strategy (if Scripted): Locate the next overworld trigger point (likely Route 42 island or Route 36).
- Strategy (Tin Tower): If all sightings are complete and Clear Bell is held, Suicune will be a static encounter at Tin Tower 1F. Use XENON to trap/sleep, then chip away with False Swipe (if available) or low-power moves before using Ultra/Great Balls.
