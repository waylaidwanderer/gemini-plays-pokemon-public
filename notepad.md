# Blackthorn Gym 1F - Battle with Clair
- Current Turn: 35186

## Battle Strategy: Gym Leader Clair
- Opponent: Leader Clair
- Pokémon 1: Dragonair (Lv37). Moves: Thunder Wave, Surf. (FAINTED)
- Pokémon 2: Kingdra (Lv40). Moves: Surf.
- Status: Xenon fainted. Calcifer fainted (Turn 35185).
- Strategy: Calcifer fainted to Kingdra's Surf. I will send out KIMCHI (Lv33) because her Grass typing resists Surf. I'll use Sleep Powder to disable Kingdra, then use a Revive on Calcifer. Gneiss is too risky due to 4x Water weakness.
- Note: Kingdra is Water/Dragon. Weak only to Dragon-type moves in Gen 2. Electric/Grass are neutral due to Water typing. (Grass resists Water).
