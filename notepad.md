# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Navigate to the Dragon Shrine.

# Mechanics & Knowledge
- **Badge Capabilities:** Glacier Badge enables Whirlpool. Rising Badge enables Waterfall. I HAVE Glacier, so I CAN use Whirlpool.
- **Map Analysis:** The barrier at Row 23 has Whirlpools at (15,23) and (24,23). However, there appears to be a WATER gap at (28,23) in the buoy line.
- **Strategy:** Prioritize the Gap at (28,23) to avoid menuing for Whirlpool. If blocked, fall back to Whirlpool at (24,23).
