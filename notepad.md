# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- **Start Turn:** 48900
- **Timestamp:** Turn 49381 (Resumed)
- **Status:** Back in city at (14, 30). Executing Western Corridor path.

## Execution Plan (Refined)
1. Walk East to (12, 33), then South to (12, 51). (Bypasses Row 34 and Row 48 ledges). <- CURRENT TASK
2. Walk West to (2, 51).
3. Walk North to (2, 12) to enter the western corridor.
4. Walk East to (14, 12).
5. Walk North to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune.

## Strategy: Western Corridor Path
The northern plateau is only accessible from the far west (X=2). Column X=12 is a clear vertical corridor that bypasses all ledge lines (Row 34, Row 48). I will loop around the south at Row 51 to reach the western path.

## Tile Mechanics (Global)
- **FLOOR**: Traversable ground. No special effects.
- **WALL**: Impassable barrier.
- **WATER**: Requires Surf HM to traverse.
- **BUOY**: Impassable water barrier.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL**: One-way ledge. Blocks DOWN (South) movement. Allows UP, LEFT, and RIGHT movement. (Verified at (6, 46), (7, 34)).
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN**: One-way jump South. Impassable from the North side.
- **DOOR**: Warp entry point. Leads to a different map.
- **BOULDER**: Requires Strength HM to push.
- **ROCK**: Small smashable rock. Requires Rock Smash HM.

## Failed Hypotheses & Lessons
- Terrestrial Path (South): Blocked by ledges.
- Great Sea Bypass (Route 40): Dead end on the West.
- Inner Channel South: Blocked at Row 15 by solid buoy line (except X=23).
- Inner Channel Water Path: Entirely blocked by buoy walls (Row 9, Row 25). Must use island hop.
