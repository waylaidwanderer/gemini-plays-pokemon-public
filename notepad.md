# III. Puzzle Solutions & Learnings

- **Victory Road 1F Puzzle (CORRECTION):** My previous notes were incorrect. There is no switch at (3, 10). Pushing the boulder there was a mistake that led to a dead end. The assumption that the puzzle must be solved without leaving the map is now also in question. New plan is to reset the puzzle by exiting and re-entering.
