- Turn 9916: Inside Route 31 Gatehouse. Mail forged and ready. Exiting east to Route 31.
- Turn 9918: Exiting Gatehouse to Route 31. Next target: Fisher at (17, 7).
- Turn 9919: Moving East on Route 31. Target: Ledge at (13, 7).
- Plan: Hop ledge, navigate to (17, 8), deliver mail to Fisher.
- Note: Avoiding row 6 (Youngster) and row 8 (safe but 7 is direct). Assumed Youngster is non-hostile.
- Turn 9920: Moving Right x6 to reach (15, 7).
- Note: Ledge at (13, 7) will be hopped. Fruit Tree expected at (16, 7), so stopping at (15, 7) to reassess approach to Fisher (17, 7).
- Turn 9921: Moving to (17, 8) to interact with Fisher.
- Path: Down to (15, 8) -> Right to (17, 8) to bypass Fruit Tree at (16, 7).

- Turn 9925: Selecting Kenya (Down -> A) to attempt delivery of "Dark Cave leads to another road" (no period).
- Note: Previous turn likely selected Mistral by mistake, causing "It doesn't have any MAIL" dialogue. Retrying.
- Turn 9926: Delivery failed ("It doesn't have any MAIL"). Likely selected Mistral (Slot 4) instead of Kenya (Slot 5).
- Action: Clearing text (B), re-initiating conversation (A).
- Next Step: Carefully select Kenya in the party menu.
- Turn 9927: Correcting position. Moved to (17, 9) by accident. Moving Up to (17, 8) to talk to Fisher again.
