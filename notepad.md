# Pokémon Yellow Legacy - Hard Mode Notes

## Hard Mode Rules (Player-Only Restrictions):
*   **Battle Style:** Set mode (no switching after knocking out an opponent).
*   **No items allowed in battle** — no healing, status cures, or stat boosts.
*   **Level caps:** Your Pokémon cannot exceed the level cap for your current progress. If a Pokémon reaches the cap, it will not gain experience from battles until the next cap is unlocked. The level cap is always set to the highest level ("Ace") Pokémon of the next Gym Leader or Elite Four member you must face.

## Level Cap Table:
*   0 badges: **12**
*   1 badge: **21**
*   2 badges: **24**

## Gameplay and Balance Changes (Noted from Prompt):
*   HMs can be forgotten, used from the menu without teaching, and cannot be stored in the PC.
*   All 151 Pokémon are obtainable in one save.
*   Trade evolutions happen by level (e.g., Haunter → Gengar at 42, Machoke → Machamp at 38).
*   Trainer AI is smarter, uses anti-sweep tactics.
*   Boss fights are significantly tougher.
*   Dynamic scaling applies to Gyms 4–6.
