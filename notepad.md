# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Standard ground. Traversable.
- WATER: Surf required. Traversable.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- WALL: Impassable.
- DOOR: Warp point.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable cliff face. Blocks movement into the face (e.g., at 6, 34 blocks South).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
- BREAKABLE ROCK: Requires Rock Smash. Impassable.
- NPC: Impassable. Interact from adjacent tile.

# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The X=4 Ledge Shortcut (Verified Route)
- Plan:
  1. Select NO to Surf prompt at (12, 28). [DONE]
  2. Walk West along Row 28 to (4, 28). [IN PROGRESS]
  3. Walk Down to (4, 29), then Down to jump the ledge at (4, 30).
  4. Walk West to (2, 31), then North along X=2 to (2, 10).
  5. Walk East to (14, 10).
- Status: At (12, 28), heading West.
- Reasoning: (4, 30) is a jumpable ledge (⤵️) that provides access to the clear West Beach corridor (X=2), bypassing all city walls and the buoy maze. Row 28 is a confirmed FLOOR corridor to the ledge.
