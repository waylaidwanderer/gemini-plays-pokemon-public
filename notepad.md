# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Current Objectives
1. **Find Floria**: Located at Route 36 (North of Route 35).
2. **Get SquirtBottle**: Return to Flower Shop (19, 1) after finding Floria.
3. **Clear Sudowoodo**: Use SquirtBottle on Route 36.

### Navigation Status: Goldenrod City (Puzzle)
- **Goal**: Reach Route 35 (North).
- **Problem**: Main path blocked at (16, 4). East Path blocked at (32, 6) by fence.
- **Verified Dead Ends**:
    - **Sister's House Area (29, 5)**: Blocked.
    - **Alcove (31, 6)**: Blocked by fence.
    - **East House (33, 9)**: NPCs discussing PP. Likely no passage.
    - **Route 34 East Loop**: Blocked by fence at Row 3.
- **Hypothesis**:
    1. **Underground North Exit**: The North Exit of the Underground (9, 6) dumps me North of the blocking wall. I can reach the Flower Shop and Route 35 from there.
- **Immediate Plan**: Re-enter Underground at (21, 25). Check for alternate stairs at North end of tunnel (x=4?). Goal: Exit at (9, 6).

### Verified Locations
- **Goldenrod City**:
    - Pokemon Center: (15, 27)
    - Dept Store: (24, 27)
    - Game Corner: (14, 21)
    - Bike Shop: (29, 29)
    - Underground Entrances: (11, 29) [South], (9, 5) [North]

### Quest Log
- **Badges**: Zephyr, Hive, Plain.
- **Party**: Quilava (27), Sentret (2), Bellsprout (6), Togepi (5), Rattata (8), Igglybuff (5).
### Reflection (Turn 9251)
- **Progress**: Confirmed West tracks are a dead end.
- **Plan**: Enter Underground via South Entrance (11, 29).
- **Underground Reality**: The Underground Tunnel (Map 3_53) connects two Southern entrances:
    - West Ent: Goldenrod (11, 29)
    - East Ent: Goldenrod (21, 25) [My current location]
    - Conclusion: The Underground does NOT lead to the North side (Row 6).
- **New Plan**: Navigate on the surface. Go West to the main street, then North to the Radio Tower area. Look for the "Narrow Path" at x=3 to bypass the blockade at (4, 16).
