# Suicune Hunt Strategy (Started Turn #13189)
- Lead: KIMCHI (Lv 21 Gloom).
- Method: Repel Trick (Wild Lv 13-16). Pacing (Grass Dance) at (28, 7) on Route 38.
- Tracking: Use Pokedex AREA map via `check_suicune_location_v6`.
- Battle Plan: Turn 1 Sleep Powder. Use `suicune_capture_analyst_v2`.
- Capture Notes: Status and HP damage are permanent. Sleep prevents fleeing on Turn 1. Suicune is Lv 40.

# Roaming Pokémon Reference
- Movement: Suicune shifts routes ONLY when the player crosses a map boundary (warp, carpet, or edge), uses Fly, or after a battle with the roamer.
- Logic: Pacing in grass, phone calls, or battling OTHER wild Pokemon on the same route do NOT move it.
- Johto Map Dots: Pokedex shows roamers as red dots. Route 38 is at Johto map (5, 5).

# Global Tile Mechanics
- TALL_GRASS / LONG_GRASS: Traversable. Triggers wild encounters. Repel Trick works here.
- FLOOR: Traversable. Standard ground.
- WALL / HEADBUTT_TREE / MART_SHELF / COUNTER: Impassable.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN / LEFT / RIGHT: One-way traversable in the indicated direction.
- WARP_CARPET_RIGHT: Traversable. Triggers map transition.
- OLIVINE_CITY (18, 17): Wall (Impassable).

# Route 38/39 Boundary Reference
- Route 38 (0, 8) <-> Route 39 (19, 8)
- Route 38 (0, 10) <-> Route 39 (19, 10)
- Crossing this line shifts roamer locations.

# PC Storage (Box 1)
- ROCKY (Onix Lv 6), EGG (Cleffa Lv 5), XFDW (Meowth Lv 16), FRITTATA (Togepi Lv 5), SHUCKIE (Shuckle Lv 15).

# Lessons Learned & Error Analysis
- Tool Reliability: Roamer tracking tools must reset the menu cursor to POKEDEX (press Up 8 times).
- Navigation: Paths are often wider than one tile. Analyze adjacent tiles before assuming a path is blocked.
- State Sync: Always verify inventory and money against Game State Information.
- Map Limits: Route 39 is 20 tiles wide (X=0 to 19). (20, 8) is out of bounds.
