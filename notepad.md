## Reflection (Turn 51)
- **Notepad:** Current structure is good.
- **Agents:** A pathfinding agent could be useful later. Also considering an agent to help with starter selection.
- **Hindsight:** Misread the map in my house and walked into a wall. Need to be more careful.
- **Goals:** Goals remain solid: get starter, explore town.
- **Assumptions:** 
    1. The building to the west is Elm's Lab. (Will verify by entering).
    2. The NPC at (12, 9) is not immediately critical. (Will talk to them later).
    3. No hidden items in my house. (Seems safe for now).
    4. Water requires Surf. (Standard mechanic).
