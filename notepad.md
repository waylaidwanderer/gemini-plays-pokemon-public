# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Navigation Notes
- **Location**: Goldenrod City (West Side).
- **Goal**: Reach East Goldenrod via Underground.
- **Current Action**: Moving to Underground Entrance (SW) at (5, 25).
- **Reasoning**: The West side (x=0-9) is isolated. The "Gatehouse" at (4, 29) appears to be the Pokemon Center, and Row 30 is blocked. The only way to the East side (Main Road) is to re-enter the Underground and exit at the other end (likely x=21).
- **Plan**: Enter Underground at (5, 25) -> Go North -> Exit at the other end -> Arrive in East Goldenrod.

### Resource Alert
- **Pokeballs**: 10 Poké Balls, 1 Lure Ball.
