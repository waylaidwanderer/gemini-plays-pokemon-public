# Johto Journey: Gem's Log

## Strategic Plan: Return to Professor Elm
1. Exit Mr. Pokémon's House.
2. Travel south through Route 30 to Cherrygrove City.
3. Travel east through Route 29 to New Bark Town.
4. Deliver the Mystery Egg to Professor Elm.

## Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard traversable ground.
- WALL: Impassable barrier.
- TALL_GRASS: Standard traversable grass; triggers wild encounters.
- LEDGE_HOP_RIGHT: One-way (East only). Jump from left, wall from right.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way (South only). Jump from top, wall from bottom.
- LEDGE_HOP_LEFT: One-way (West only). Jump from right, wall from left.
- DOOR / STAIRCASE / WARP_CARPET: Warp points between maps or floors.
- HEADBUTT_TREE / CUT_TREE / WATER: Impassable; require HM moves.

## Lessons Learned
- NPCs act as walls; plan paths around them.
- Buildings are often larger than they appear; check all sides.
- Tool Usage: Verify input schemas and handle input dictionaries explicitly.
- Exploration: Check building corners and behind counters.
- Scripted Events: Treat character movement during dialogue as completed interaction.
- Ledges: Strictly one-way. Jumping simulates moving two tiles.
- Pathfinding: Treat 'unseen' tiles as potentially walkable but verify in-game.
