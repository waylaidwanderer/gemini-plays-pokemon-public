### Current Status
- **Location**: Flower Shop (Goldenrod City).
- **Badge**: Plain Badge (Obtained).
- **Key Items**: Radio Card, Bicycle, Coin Case, Plain Badge.

### Objectives
1. Get SquirtBottle.
2. Go to Route 34 (Daycare).
3. Defeat Sudowoodo (Route 36).

### Tile Mechanics
- TYPE_3fe2: Floor (Walkable)
- TYPE_63e2: Wall/Planter (Blocked)
- TYPE_ffbb: Warp/Door (Walkable)
- TYPE_989e: Door Mat (Likely Blocked/Collision)
- Strategy: Interact with Sudowoodo on Route 36 to 'activate' the need for the SquirtBottle, then return to Goldenrod Flower Shop.
- Issue: Route 35 Gatehouse (Map 11_8) doors at (3, 0) and (4, 0) are closed/blocked. Guard is MISSING from (5, 1).
- Plan: Finish call with Joey. Search for the guard (maybe at 5,2 or 4,2?) or check if the door opens automatically after the call.
- Dead End: The alley west of the Game Corner (around 6,6) is blocked by walls. Must go south to Radio Tower to access the west side.
