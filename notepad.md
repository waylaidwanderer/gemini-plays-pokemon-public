- Pikachu (Lv81): Defeated by GNEISS.
- Espeon (Lv73): Defeated (Turn 43777).
- XENON (Haunter): Active. HP 111/111. Dream Eater PP: 0/15. Night Shade PP: 15/15.
- Snorlax (Lv75): Active. Asleep (Turn 43863 via Rest).
  - Moves: Body Slam, Snore, Rest (6/10), Amnesia. (Haunter is immune to Normal).
- GNEISS (Graveler): Benched. HP 24/152. Paralyzed.
- GORP (Snorlax): Benched. HP 141/221.
- Inventory: 4 Full Restores, 8 Max Potions, 18 Revives, 12 Full Heals, 1 Elixer.
- Strategy: Use Night Shade now that Dream Eater PP is gone. XENON is immune to Snorlax's attacking moves. Watch for Amnesia (buffs Special Defense). Night Shade ignores these buffs.
- Observation: Snorlax woke up and immediately used Rest again at Turn 43863. It's back to full HP.
- Note: Night Shade deals fixed 44 damage and ignores Amnesia's Sp.Def buffs. Currently on Turn 0 of sleep (Turn 43863).
- Battle Progress: Snorlax is a complete wall to Haunter; it has no moves that can damage us. This is a safe but slow victory. Night Shade will take ~8-10 hits to force another Rest.
