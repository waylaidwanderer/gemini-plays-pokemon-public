## Strategy & Lessons
- Path to Azalea: Exit Violet City south to Route 32. Follow road south to Union Cave. Pass through cave to reach Azalea Town.
- Training (How-To): Switch-train Rocky (Onix) or Egg (Togepi) by leading with a stronger Pokemon (Gneiss or Calcifer), then immediately switching to the trainee on Turn 1 of a battle. This splits EXP and ensures safety.
