# Strategy: Trigger Suicune Sighting (Started: Turn 51131, Turn 51356 - Refined Plan)
- City Logic: Vertical walls and buoy barriers partition the city. The Outer Sea (X=27+) is the only water route to the northern coast.
- The Outer Sea Highway (Execution Plan):
  1. Confirm SURF at (12, 28).
  2. Surf North to Row 21.
  3. Surf East to X=27 (clears buoy barriers at X=16, X=19, X=23).
  4. Surf North at X=27 to Row 8 (clears buoy barrier at Row 9).
  5. Surf West to X=14, then South to land at (14, 10).
- Battle Prep: Lead Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion).

# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard traversable tile.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable collision.
- WATER: Traversable only while using SURF.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way passage (South only). Jump FROM ledge to tile below.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way passage (North only). Walk ONTO from south or walk North from it.
- ROCK (Object): Impassable until cleared with ROCK SMASH.

# Discoveries
- Smashed Rocks: (5, 29), (4, 25).
- Suicune sighting spot: (14, 10).
