# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Location:** Route 28 (Middle Section).
- **Status:** Surfing to Landfall.
- **Action:** Surf West to (19, 8) to land.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Currently on water at (23, 8).
  2. Need to reach the western landmass.
  3. Will land at (19, 8) and then head for the gap in the ledges at x=17 to go North.
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Need to reach the hidden house at (7, 3).
  2. Validated path: Surf West -> Land -> Go North through gap at (17, 7).
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.

# Tile Mechanics
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN:** One-way South.
- **LEDGE_HOP_LEFT:** One-way Left.
- **WARP_CARPET:** Step on to exit map.
- **CUT_TREE:** Obstacle unless Cut is used.
- **PIT:** Drops player to floor below.
- **LADDER:** Transitions between floors.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Walkable from South/Sides. Northbound exit is BLOCKED (Verified at 8,14). Acts as a one-way ledge preventing Northward movement.
- **BUOY:** Water boundary/Wall.
- **Tree at (31, 3):** Not Cuttable (Verified).

# Reflection (Turn 25132)
