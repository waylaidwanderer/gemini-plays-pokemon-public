3. Swap Exp. Share to Xenon, Amulet Coin to Kimchi (check held items).
4. Lead with Gneiss (Lv46) for safe/fast grinding.
5. Return to training on Route 45 after the swarm event.

# Strategy: Rising Badge (Gym Leader Clair)
- Team: Xenon (Haunter), Kimchi (Gloom), Calcifer (Typhlosion), Gneiss (Graveler).
- Plan: Use Night Shade (Xenon) for fixed damage. Use Sleep Powder/Hypnosis for control.
- Kingdra Strategy: Use Sleep Powder (Kimchi) and Night Shade (Xenon) to bypass defenses.
- Speed Control: Teach TM16 Icy Wind to Naga or Blitz to slow down Dragonairs. (Note: TM16 not in PC or Inventory).
- Survival: Level supports to Lv40+ to survive hits.
- Party Management: Swap low-level members (Icarus, Ravioli) for stronger PC options (Naga Lv42, Blitz Lv40) before challenging.

# Swarm Investigation: Yanma (Route 35)
- Turn 33075: Arrived on Route 35 to investigate the Yanma swarm reported by Arnie.
- Strategy: Lead with Gneiss (Lv46) to avoid weak encounters and use Great Balls to catch Yanma if not already caught. 
- Goal: Verify if Yanma is already in Pokedex and catch one if needed. (Check: Pokedex shows Yanma is already caught).
- Training: If swarm is active, use the increased encounter rate to train Xenon and Kimchi.
- Current Status: Swarm reported, starting investigation in tall grass.
