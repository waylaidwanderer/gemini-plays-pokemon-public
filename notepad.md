# Plan
1.  **Champion Lance:**
    - **Lead:** Muscle (26 HP). Sacrificial lead.
    - **Matchup Reality Check:**
      - Lance's team is ALL Flying-types (Gyarados, Dragonites, Charizard, Aerodactyl).
      - **Fighting (Cross Chop) is Not Very Effective (0.5x)** on all except Aerodactyl (Neutral).
      - **Ground (Dig) is IMMUNE (0x)** on all.
      - **Normal (Strength) is Neutral (1.0x)** on all except Aerodactyl (Resisted).
    - **Strategy:** Spam **Strength**. It is my most reliable damage source (80 BP + STAB > 50 BP effective Cross Chop).
    - **Aerodactyl:** Use Gyarados (Surf) or Muscle (Cross Chop - Neutral).
    - **Zombie Mode:** Revive Muscle repeatedly. Strength spam to win.

# Battle Log
- **Vs Bruno:** Victory.
