- **Status**: Garnet evolved into Typhlosion! Inside Olivine Lighthouse. Climbing to find Jasmine.
- **Quest**: Heal Sick Miltank (Moomoo Farm). Gave 1 Berry. Needs more (approx 4-6 more regular Berries).
- **Quest**: Heal Amphy (Ampharos) at Lighthouse. Jasmine is with it. Need to cure it to challenge her.
- **Hint**: Gentleman Preston mentions Jasmine *used to* use Rock Pokémon like Onix. Implies she might have switched types (likely Steel).
- **Hint**: Sailor Kent suggests the Pharmacy in Cianwood has medicine.
- **5F**: Side corridors are dead ends. Hole at (16, 7) drops to 4F East.
- **4F**: Split into West and East sides, connected by Bottom Corridor (Row 14).
  - **West Side**: Stairs Up to 5F Left (3, 5). Stairs Down to 3F (13, 3) - Wait, (13,3) is East side.
  - **East Side**: Stairs Up to 5F Center (9, 5)? Need to verify. Stairs Down to 3F (13, 3).
- **Plan**: Take Bottom Corridor (Row 14) to East Side, then check Stairs at (9, 5).
