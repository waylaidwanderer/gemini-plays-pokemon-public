# Ice Path Strategy (B1F)

## Current Status
- **Position:** Player at (11, 3).
- **Goal:** Solve B1 (Top Right Boulder).
- **Puzzle State:**
  - **B1:** At (10, 1) (Incorrectly pushed up?). Needs correction.
  - **B2:** (7, 8).
  - **B4:** (17, 7).

## Recovery Plan for B1
1.  **Navigate to (10, 0):** (Via 12,3 -> 12,1 -> 11,0).
2.  **Push Down:** Push B1 Down to (10, 5).
3.  **Push Right:** Push B1 to (12, 5).
4.  **Push Up:** Push B1 to (12, 2).
5.  **Push Left:** Push B1 into Pit (11, 2).

## Finishing Plan
- After B1 is in Pit (11, 2), solve B2.
## Reflection (Turn 16989)
- Caught Swinub (Truffle).
- Boulder puzzle B1 needs reset and correction.
- Plan: Finish naming, then execute recovery plan for B1.
- Created "type_text" tool plan for future naming efficiency.
