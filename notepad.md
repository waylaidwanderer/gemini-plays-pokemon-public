# Pokémon Crystal Playthrough
- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Current Status
- **Location**: Cianwood City (22_9), Inside Pharmacy.
- **Goal**: Get SecretPotion.
- **Status**: Battling Swimmer Kara (Pokemon 2: Starmie).
- **Reasoning**:
  1. **Situation Critical**: Garnet has 15/128 HP. Starmie has ~60% HP.
  2. **Speed**: Garnet (Lv 40) is faster than Starmie (Lv 20), so I get one more attack.
  3. **Damage**: Flame Wheel is NVE. Unlikely to OHKO from 60%.
  4. **Outcome**: Garnet will likely faint next turn.
  5. **Strategy (The "Phoenix" Protocol)**:
     - Attack with Flame Wheel.
     - If Garnet faints:
       1. Send out fodder (e.g., Spinarak).
       2. Use **REVIVE** on Garnet.
       3. Fodder faints.
       4. Send out Garnet (64 HP).
       5. Finish Starmie.
- **Plan**:
  1. Advance Text.
  2. Select FLAME WHEEL.
  3. Prepare for Revive Strat.

### Objectives
- **Primary**: Obtain Mineral Badge (Jasmine).
- **Secondary**: Get SecretPotion (Cianwood).
- **Tertiary**: Train Basil to Lvl 21.

### Notes
- **Cianwood Pharmacy**: Supposed to have the SecretPotion.
- **Gym**: Chuck (Fighting). Weak to Psychic/Flying. Needs Strength (HM04) to reach.
- **Plan**:
  1. Get SecretPotion (Current).
  2. Buy Repels at General Store (22_3).
  3. Surf to Olivine City.
  4. Get HM04 (Strength) from Café.
  5. Climb Lighthouse, Heal Amphy.
  6. Defeat Jasmine (Steel) with Garnet.
  7. Return to Cianwood (Surf), Defeat Chuck, get Fly.
- **Shuckle Guy**: Found at (17, 41) in Cianwood (Map 22_4). Offers a Shuckle to look after.
- **Search Update**: Building at (17, 41) is NOT the Pharmacy. Pharmacy is likely South of the Pokemon Center.
- **Discovery**: Found a previously unnoticed door at (15, 37) in Cianwood.
- **Hypothesis**: This is likely the Pharmacy.
- **Plan**: Navigate to (15, 38) and enter.
