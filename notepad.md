# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Reach the Dragon Shrine via the East Whirlpool.

# Current Status (Turn 18310)
- **Location:** Dragon's Den B1F (24, 22).
- **Action:** Retry Navigation to (26, 22).
- **Reasoning:** 
    - Previous navigation failed (likely due to malformed path_plan missing start node).
    - Still need to test Eastern Buoys at (26, 23) and (27, 22).
    - If movement fails again, I am physically blocked or stuck, and must try a different direction entirely.
- **Sequence:**
  1. Navigate to (26, 22).
  2. Next Turn: Interact with Buoys.

# Plan
1. Move to (26, 22).
2. Test (26, 23) and (27, 22).
3. If successful, proceed.
4. If fails, Navigate North to explore the channel and look for a gap in the barrier or another path.

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Obstacle. Requires HM06 + Badge.
- **Buoy:** Possibly unbreakable barrier. Need to verify if *any* in this group are breakable.

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Requires HM06 Whirlpool + Glacier Badge. 
- **Lava/Magma:** (None here).
- **Ice:** (None here).

# Lessons
- **Menu Navigation:** Always verify cursor position before committing to a sequence. Blind input leads to wrong menus (e.g., PACK instead of POKEMON).
