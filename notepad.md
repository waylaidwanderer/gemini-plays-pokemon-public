# General Lessons
- Puzzle Bypass: Always explore the perimeter of a room. The Blackthorn boulder puzzle is skippable via the right-side path.
- Battle Strategy: High-level starters are essential. Fixed damage (Night Shade) and status (Sleep Powder) are great, but the user must be high enough level to not be OHKO'd before acting.
- Resource Management: Carrying zero Revives into a late-game Gym Leader battle is a critical error.
- Pathfinding: Don't assume a boulder puzzle is mandatory; explore all paths first.
