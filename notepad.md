# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH. Allows NORTH. Verified: Down at (24, 45) failed (Turn 49602).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH. Found at Row 15 (X=3-17).
- ROCK: Smashable rocks act as WALLs.
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
## Strategy: Upper Western Bypass (Row 33/26)
Reach (14, 10) by looping through internal corridors to reach X=2.
1. Move North along X=12 to (12, 33).
2. Move West through gap at (9, 33) to (6, 33).
3. Move North along X=6 to (6, 26).
4. Move West through gap at (5, 26) to (4, 26).
5. Move South along X=4 to (4, 33).
6. Move West to (2, 33) (Western Corridor).
7. Walk North along X=2 to Row 12 (bypasses Row 15 ledge).
8. Walk East along Row 12 to (14, 12).
9. Walk North to (14, 10).
- Current Step: Navigating to (12, 33).

# Progress Notes
- X=12 Corridor: Clear from Row 49 to Row 33.
- Gap (9, 33): Allows crossing X=9 wall.
- X=6 Corridor: Clear from Row 33 to Row 26.
- Gap (5, 26): Allows crossing X=5 wall.
- X=4 Corridor: Clear from Row 26 to Row 33.
- X=2 Corridor: Clear from Row 33 to Row 12.
- Row 12: Clear horizontal path from X=2 to X=14.
- Verified: Row 34 ledge (X=6-8) blocks South from (6, 33) to (6, 34).
- Verified: Row 15 ledge (X=3-17) blocks North. X=2 corridor bypasses it.
