# Cianwood City Progression
## Strategy: Trigger Suicune Sighting at (14, 10)
- **Start Turn:** 50283
- **Status:** Investigating accessibility. Land boulders may block all routes.
- **Plan:**
  1. Verify if land route to (14, 10) is possible without Rock Smash.
  2. If blocked, obtain TM08 Rock Smash from Pokefan M (Main map, ID 2) or Route 36 NPC.
  3. Navigate to (14, 10) and trigger sighting.

## Global Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable.
- WATER: Requires Surf.
- DOOR / WARP_CARPET: Warp point.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way South jump.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way North climb.
- SMASHABLE_ROCK (Object): Impassable. Requires Rock Smash.

## General Lessons
- **NPC Interaction:** Intercepting moving NPCs is more reliable than chasing them. Position in their walking path and wait.

## Failed Hypotheses
- Eastern Water Route: Blocked by Row 15 wall/buoy line in Section 1.
- Pokefan M (Initial talk): Hint only.
- Mania (2, 4): Dead end.
- Lass (14, 44): Dead end.
- Pharmacy (15, 47): Dead end.
