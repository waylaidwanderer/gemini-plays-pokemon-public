# Strategy: The Suicune Pursuit
- **Primary Goal:** Trigger Suicune sighting at (14, 10).
- **Secondary Goal:** Defeat Eusine immediately after sighting.
- **Eusine Roster:** Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25).
- **Battle Strategy:** Lead with Lv64 Calcifer. Sweep with Flamethrower/Thunderpunch.
- **Navigation Plan (The "South Bypass"):**
  1. Navigate to (6, 46).
  2. Climb the terrace West to (5, 46) and (4, 46).
  3. Walk North along the far-left corridor (X=4 or X=2) to Row 14.
  4. Walk East to (8, 14), then North to Row 12.
  5. Walk East to (14, 12), then North to (14, 10).

# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard traversable terrain.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable terrain.
- WATER: Traversable only with Surf.
- DOOR / WARP_CARPET: Map transition points.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Allows jumping down (South) but blocks movement from the opposite direction (North).
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Terrace edges. Verified: (6, 46) allows climbing West. Hypothesis: Often act as one-way ledges or require specific entry points.
- ROCK (Object): Blocks movement; can be cleared with Rock Smash. Respawns upon map transition.

# Lessons Learned
- **Cianwood Pathing:** (11, 15) leads to a dead-end pocket. (4, 20) blocks South movement. Use the South Bypass at (6, 46) instead.
- **Respawn Logic:** Overworld rocks respawn when leaving and re-entering the area.
- **Poke Seer's House:** (5, 17) is a regular interior, not a shortcut.
