# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
- **Start Turn:** 49885
- **Current Status:** Pivoting to Surf Strategy. Land routes are blocked by ledges at Row 34 and Row 15.

## Active Strategy: The Sea Route
Reaching the northern plateau (14, 10) requires landing at the beach at (13, 16), which is only accessible via Surf from the south.
1. Navigate to the Central Surf Point at (12, 28). (In Progress)
2. Use Surf (GORP) and travel North to (13, 17).
3. Land at (13, 16).
4. Walk North to trigger Suicune at (14, 10).

## Verified Obstacles (Land)
- Row 15: Ledge (10, 15) blocks North. WALLs (12-17, 15) block access from the East.
- Row 34: FLOOR_UP_WALL (6-8, 34) blocks southern land access on the East side.
- X=9: Vertical wall blocks East/West travel from Row 34 to Row 40.
- X=5: Vertical wall blocks East/West travel from Row 15 to Row 33, with gaps at Row 18, 19, 24-28.

## Battle Plan: Eusine
- Lead: Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion).
- Strategy: Flamethrower sweep.
- Status: Fully healed.

## Failed Hypotheses
- Hypothesis 1: Reach plateau via Western Corridor (X=2). Result: Blocked by WALL at (3, 18) and rocks.
- Hypothesis 2: Reach plateau via Eastern Gap (X=11). Result: Blocked by WALL at (11, 31).
- Hypothesis 3: Bypass Row 34 ledge via X=5 gap. Result: Blocked by WALL at (5, 33).
Conclusion: Land-only access to the plateau is impossible. Surf is required.
