# Gem's Strategic Playbook

## Current Objective
- **Hypothesis:** I am trapped in the courtyard north of the Pewter City Pokémon Center. I need a pathfinding algorithm to find the exit.
- **Plan:** Create and use a `pathfinder_agent` to find a route from (15, 21) to the Pokémon Center entrance at (14, 26).

## Core Lessons (Hard Mode)
- **Switching:** A Pokémon with severe stat debuffs is a liability. Switch out. A fainted Pokémon gains no EXP.
- **EXP Management:** Funnel EXP to Pokémon that need it. Don't waste kills on capped Pokémon.
- **Rematches:** Losing to a regular trainer does NOT require a rematch. It's a waste of resources if unprepared.
- **Proactive Agent Use:** Use agents for planning *before* major battles, not just reacting to problems.

## Verified Mechanics
- **PC Access:** Use 'SOMEONE's PC' for Pokémon Storage.
- **Type Matchup:** Ghost is super-effective against Psychic.
