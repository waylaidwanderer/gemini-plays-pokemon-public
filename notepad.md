# Strategy: Suicune Hunt (Johto)
- Status: Suicune confirmed on Route 42 via Pokedex (Turn 21433).
- Strategy: Trigger Sighting 3 flee event by walking toward the Apricorn trees (Y=16) from the north (Mt. Mortar entrance).
- Lessons Learned:
    - Pokedex: Alphabetical order places SUICUNE between SUDOWOODO and SUNKERN.
    - Scripted: Sighting sequence is fixed. Pokedex AREA map tracks current scripted location.
    - Map Reset: Performed map reset by entering Mount Mortar (Turn 21550).
    - Trigger: Suicune on Route 42 is a tile trigger on the southern Apricorn island floor, likely activated by walking south from the Mt. Mortar middle entrance toward the trees.

# Primary Goal Strategy: Catch Suicune at Tin Tower 1F
1. Complete scripted Johto sightings (Burned Tower, Cianwood, Route 42).
2. Defeat/interact with Eusine as required (Cianwood complete).
3. Obtain the Clear Bell (Complete - In inventory as of Turn 21577).
4. Trigger Route 42 sighting (Current).
5. Head to Tin Tower in Ecruteak City.
6. Battle and catch Suicune at the 1F altar.

# Milestone Audit
- Sighting 1: Burned Tower (Complete).
- Sighting 2: Cianwood (Complete).
- Eusine: Defeated in Cianwood (Complete).
- Sighting 3: Route 42 (Current).
- Arthur (Thursday): Located on Route 36. Provides Hard Stone.

# Repetitive Task: Suicune Island Sweep
- Start Turn: 21556 (Current Turn: 21601)
- Status: Abandoning "facing" hypothesis. Transitioning to "walking south from cave" approach.

# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable. Standard ground. [Verified]
- WALL: Impassable. [Verified]
- WATER: Traversable via Surf. [Verified]
- HEADBUTT_TREE/CUT_TREE/FRUIT_TREE: Impassable. Interaction only. [Verified]
- TALL_GRASS: Traversable. Wild encounters. [Verified]
- WARP: CAVE, WARP_CARPET, LADDER. [Verified]
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable ledge (one-way down). [Verified]

# Contingency Plan
- If sweep fails to trigger Suicune, I will:
    1. Re-verify Pokedex AREA map for exact location.
    2. Check Route 36 (Sighting 4) to see if sequence advanced.
    3. Visit Tin Tower (Sighting 5) if others are skipped.
    4. Fly to Ecruteak to reset the map and return.
