# Week Siblings Strategy
- Arthur (Thursday): Route 36. Provides Hard Stone. [COMPLETED - Turn 21872]
- Lesson: Moving NPCs like Arthur can be difficult to interact with. Use `stun_npc` to freeze them in place.
- Lesson: Never mix directional inputs and the A button in the same turn; the system will strip the A button to prevent errors. Move first, then interact.

# NPC & Interaction Lessons
