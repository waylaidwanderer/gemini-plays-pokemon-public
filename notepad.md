## Suicune Quest Log (Crystal Version)
- Prerequisites: Clear Bell (Obtained).
- Quest Start: Turn 24182.
- Sequence:
  1. Burned Tower (Flee event observed).
  2. Cianwood City North (Flee event observed).
  3. Eusine Battle (Cianwood) - Defeated (Turn 21034).
  4. Route 42 sighting: REQUIRED. Target: (26, 15).
  5. Route 36 sighting: REQUIRED. Target: (35, 9).
  6. Tin Tower Gatehouse: Sage passage granted (Turn 26846).
  7. Wise Trio Battle: Gated by sightings.

## Strategy for Wise Trio Battle
- Sages: Gaku, Masa, Koji.
- Pokémon: Noctowl (Lv32) and Kadabra (Lv32).
- Strategy: Lead Calcifer (Typhlosion) with Thunderpunch.
- Note: Sages will ONLY battle once all Suicune sightings are complete.

## Tile Mechanics - Global
- FLOOR: Traversable.
- WALL / VOID / HEADBUTT_TREE: Impassable.
- WATER: Traversable via SURF.
- CUT_TREE: Requires CUT.
- LEDGE_HOP: One-way jump.

## General Lessons Learned
- **Sequential Events:** Legendary beast sightings are strictly sequential.
- **Verification:** An empty location does NOT mean a sighting is complete. The event must be triggered by approaching the specific coordinates.
- **Sage Passage:** Passing the gatehouse sage does NOT mean sightings are complete; it only means you have the Clear Bell (or Eusine is defeated). The Trio inside is the final check.

## Progress Tracking
- Current Task: Trigger Suicune sighting on Route 36 (35, 9).
- Status: Confirmed Route 42 sighting is complete (location empty). Flying to Ecruteak to reach Route 36.
## Suicune Sighting Troubleshooting
- Route 42 (26, 15): Confirmed triggered (location empty, sage passage granted).
- Route 36 (35, 9): Next target. Junction near Violet City / Ruins of Alph.
- Hypothesis: Route 36 is the final overworld trigger required before the Wise Trio will battle.
- To Check:
  - Approach (35, 9) on Route 36.
  - If triggered, return to Tin Tower Gatehouse.
