# III. Game Mechanics & Discoveries

## A. Verified Tile Mechanics
- **Ledge:** Can be jumped down (one-way). Moving down into a ledge tile moves the player two tiles down.
- **Cuttable Tree:** Requires HM Cut to pass. Respawns on map change.
- **Water:** Requires HM Surf to traverse. To use Surf from a land tile, you must be standing on a ground tile that is adjacent to a water tile, and you must be facing the water tile.
- **Boulder:** Requires HM Strength to move.
- **Hole:** Warps player to a lower floor.
- **Ladder (Up/Down):** Warps player between floors. Some ladders require stepping off and back on the tile to function.
- **Steps:** Allows vertical and horizontal movement between 'steps' and adjacent 'ground' or 'elevated_ground' tiles.

## B. General Heuristics & Rules
- **PC Interaction:** To use a PC, stand on the tile directly below it, face up, and press 'A'.
- **HM Usage:** HMs are used from the party menu outside of battle.
- **Party Planning:** Always confirm all required HMs (Fly, Surf, Strength, Cut) are present in the party *before* leaving a Pokémon Center to travel to a new area.
