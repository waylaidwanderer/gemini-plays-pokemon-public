# Strategy: The Suicune Pursuit
- **Objective:** Trigger Suicune sighting at (14, 10) in northern Cianwood.
- **Eusine Battle Prep:** Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25). Strategy: Lead with Lv64 Calcifer. Sweep with Flamethrower/Thunderpunch.
- **Current Plan (The Grand Loop):**
  1. Currently at (11, 47).
  2. Move West to (2, 47) via Row 50/51 (bypassing WALL at (7, 47)).
  3. Move North to (2, 10) (X=2 corridor is clear of Terrace Climbs).
  4. Move East to (14, 10) for the sighting.
- **Contingency:** If walking paths fail, use Surf around the east side buoy gap at (23, 7). Landing spot: (16, 10).

# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Standard traversable terrain.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable terrain.
- WATER: Traversable only with Surf.
- DOOR / WARP_CARPET: Map transition points.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump down (South). Blocks North.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL (Terrace Climb): One-way barrier. Allows North movement, blocks South.
- ROCK (Object): Blocks movement; cleared with Rock Smash. Respawns upon map transition.

# Area Notes: Cianwood City
- **Barriers:** (4, 23) is a WALL. (4, 30), (6, 34), (6, 46) are Terrace Climbs (North only).
- **Smashed Rocks:** (5, 29), (4, 25), (4, 19), (9, 17), (8, 16).
- **Dead Ends:** (11, 15) is a pocket blocked by a ledge.

# Lessons Learned
- **Time Check:** Attempting sighting since Turn #50620. Loop initiated at Turn #50840.
- **Verification:** X=2 corridor confirmed clear of Terrace Climbs in Mental Map.
