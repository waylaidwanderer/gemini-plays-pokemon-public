- **Path:** (11, 17) -> (16, 6) -> (19, 6) -> South.

    - **Union Cave 1F:** Current. Exit at (17, 31).
    - **Route 33:** South.

    - **Route 33:** South.
- **Mechanics:**
    - **Gen 2 Battle:** Items consume turn.
    - **Low Kick:** 50 BP * 1.5 STAB * 2 Type = 150 Eff BP. Onix Def reduces it significantly but 14HP is critical range.
