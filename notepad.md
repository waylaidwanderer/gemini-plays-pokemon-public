# Game Mechanics & Learnings

## Navigation & Exploration
- **Mt. Moon Layout:** The western section of 1F appears to be isolated. The path forward is likely eastward from the entrance. The ladder at (18, 12) on 1F leads to a dead-end loop on B1F.
- **Defeated Trainers as Obstacles:** Confirmed that defeated trainers act as impassable obstacles and must be navigated around.

## Battle Strategy
- **Status Effects:** Do not continue exploring with major status effects like confusion. Prioritize healing.
- **Trainer Teams:** Be prepared for trainers to have more than two Pokémon.
- **Proactive Tactics:** Don't wait until HP is critical to use priority moves like Quick Attack.
- **Risk Assessment:** Underestimated damage from a Lv. 11 Paras's Absorb. Switching in a low-level, non-resistant Pokémon is too risky for weakening wild encounters.

## Type Matchup Discoveries
- **Electric vs. Bug/Grass:** Electric-type moves (Thundershock) are 'not very effective' against Paras.
- **Electric vs. Grass/Poison:** Electric-type moves are 'not very effective' against Grass/Poison types like Oddish and Bellsprout.

## Reminders
- Stock up on healing items like Paralyze Heals and Potions at the next Poké Mart.

- **Pathfinder Failure:** The master_pathfinder_agent has repeatedly failed (4+ times) to generate a valid path on Mt. Moon 1F, often trying to route through impassable walls or up ledges. It is unreliable for this map. I will navigate manually for now.
