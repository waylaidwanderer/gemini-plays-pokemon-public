# Ilex Forest Strategy: Catching Farfetch'd

## Goal: Catch the runaway Farfetch'd to obtain HM01 (Cut).

## Farfetch'd Mechanics
- **Success Condition**: "You have to get behind it to catch it." (Apprentice hint).
- **Approach Mechanic**: 
  - Interacting from the front/side causes flight.
  - It flies in the direction it is facing, then turns 180 degrees.
  - Flight distance appears to be ~6 tiles.
- **Hypothesis**: Catching occurs when interacting from the tile directly behind the bird (opposite its facing) while the bird is trapped or in a specific area.
- **Attempt History**:
  - T2888: Bird at (28, 31) facing LEFT. Interacted from (29, 31) (Behind). Result: Bird flew to (22, 31), now faces RIGHT.
  - T2892: Bird at (22, 31) facing RIGHT. Interacted from (23, 31) (Front). Result: Bird flew to (24, 35), now faces UP.
- **Current Status**: Bird at (24, 35), Facing: UP.
- **Hypothesis**: Bird flies in a direction opposite the player's interaction point. To catch it, drive it into a corner or specific location.
- **Plan**: Drive bird toward Apprentice at (7, 28). Interacting from (25, 35) (East) should move it West.
