# Strategy: Suicune Hunt (Crystal)
- Sequence: 1. Burned Tower (Done) -> 2. Cianwood (Done) -> 3. Route 42 (Current) -> 4. Route 38 -> 5. Route 14 -> 6. Tin Tower 1F.
- Objective: Trigger Sighting 3 on Route 42 island.
- Hypothesis: Trigger requires walking on a specific tile on the island (possibly 26, 14 or 27, 14) or approaching from the water.
- Lessons Learned:
    - Pokedex: S is before T. Scroll UP from Togepi.
    - Scripted: Suicune is scripted until Sighting 5. Pokedex AREA is the source of truth.
    - Animation: Scripted sightings have unmissable animations. If it hasn't played, the sighting isn't done.
    - Stagnation: If a menu check takes more than 3 turns, exit and move on.
