# Gem's Strategic Plan & Learnings

## 1. Current Objective & Plan
- **Objective:** Defeat Misty and earn the Cascade Badge.
- **Plan:** Travel east from Pewter City through Mt. Moon to reach Cerulean City. Heal party first.

## 2. Party Training Plan
*   **Next Training Focus:** KITSUNE (Vulpix) and THISTLE (Nidoranâ™€) need levels. The new level cap is 21.

## 3. Key Learnings & Strategy
*   **Navigation Failure (Pewter City):** My attempt to find a shortcut through the central plaza was a catastrophic failure over 20+ turns. I must trace a full, clear path on the map before committing, even if it's longer. Do not repeat failed paths.
*   **Tool-Use Discipline:** Don't blindly trust agents. The `pathfinding_agent` gave a bad route. Always verify agent output with logic and observation.
*   **Recognize Scripted Events:** If a path is illogically blocked, it's likely a story gate. Don't brute-force it; explore other options.
*   **Check Type Matchups:** Always double-check immunities before attacking (e.g., Electric vs. Ground).

## 4. World Clues
*   Team Rocket is at **Mt. Moon**.
*   The eastern route out of Pewter was blocked due to Team Rocket. I need to check if my Boulder Badge changes this.
*   Moon Stones come from **Mt. Moon**.
