# Completed Missions
- **Radio Tower:** Defeated Team Rocket, rescued Director, got Clear Bell.
- **Wise Trio:** Defeated in Barrier Station.

# Suicune Hunt (Tin Tower 1F)
- **Status:** Suicune is NOT visible at (9,9) after map reload.
- **Hypothesis:** 
    1. Suicune is now roaming (check Pokedex).
    2. Event is failed/complete (check Wise Trio for dialogue change).
- **Action:** Checking Pokedex for Suicune's location. If not found, will return to Barrier Station to talk to Wise Trio.

# Map Markers
- **Sages:** (5,9), (14,6), (11,11).
- **Fake Warp:** (10,2) is just floor.

# Suicune Battle Plan
- **Level:** 40
- **Moves:** Bubblebeam, Gust, Leer, Rain Dance.
- **Strategy:** Gyarados (Dragon Rage x3) -> Sleep (Lapis/Lucid).
- **Items:** 24 Great Balls.

# Verification Log
- Checked (10,2): Not a warp.
- Checked Sage (5,9): No battle.
- Checked Sage (14,6): No battle.
- **Action:** Exited Tin Tower. Re-entering immediately to check for Suicune respawn.
- **Action:** Walking to (9,10) to confirm Suicune's presence.
- **Concern:** Since I whited out in the previous battle, there is a risk Suicune has despawned permanently or moved. Gen 2 mechanics on white-outs vs legendaries are unforgiving.
