# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Location:** Route 28 (West End).
- **Status:** Battling Wild Rapidash.
- **Action:** Select Ultra Ball (Down -> A).
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Currently in Balls Pocket. Cursor on Great Ball.
  2. Screenshot shows order: Great -> Ultra -> Master.
  3. Game State shows order: Great -> Master -> Ultra (likely alphabetical).
  4. Trusting Screenshot, but proceeding cautiously to avoid Master Ball usage.
  5. Action `Down` -> `A` opens the submenu. I will verify the selection before using.
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Reasoning:** 
  1. Catch Rapidash.
  2. Resume plan to exit Route 28 West and find the correct path to the House.
