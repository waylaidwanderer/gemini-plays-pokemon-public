# Strategic Notes
## Objectives
- **Primary:** Complete Pokedex.
- **Secondary:** Hunt Roaming Beasts (Raikou/Entei).
- **Navigation:** Return to Ecruteak City.

## Roamer Hunt
- **Target:** Raikou & Entei.
- **Method:** Route 37 Loop.
- **Note:** No trapper in party. Goal is to encounter for Dex tracking.

## Observations & Tips
- **Menu Navigation:** `navigate_menu` can register double inputs. Use `press_buttons` for precision if needed.
- **Celadon Dept Store:** 2F has Repels (Left Clerk) and TMs (3F).
- **Exploration:** Unmarked warps at (16,3) & (17,3) (Celadon Mansion back?).

# Current Strategy
## Master Ball Retrieval & Roamer Hunt
- **Goal:** Retrieve Master Ball from Elm (New Bark Town).
- **Location:** Celadon City.
- **Action:** Fly Saffron -> Train -> Fly New Bark.
- **Status:** Selecting Mistral -> Fly.
- **Action:** Press `A` (Select Mistral) -> `A` (Select Fly).
- **Next:** Navigate Map to Goldenrod (Left x2 -> Down/Left?).
- **Goal:** Fly to Goldenrod City.
- **Then:** Fly to Ecruteak -> Route 37 for Roamer Hunt.
- **Lesson:** Flavor text objects (like the ball on Elm's table) are not interactable items. Don't let them distract from the objective.
- **Lesson:** Always mark NPCs immediately. Missing 'Mom' caused a path interruption.
- **Hypothesis Refinement:** If Master Ball is not in PC, verify if I have fulfilled ALL conditions (Rising Badge is confirmed). Possibility: Inventory was full when originally offered? (Unlikely, usually they hold it). Possibility: Already used?
