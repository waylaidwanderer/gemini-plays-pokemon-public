# Suicune Capture Strategy

- Move 2: Night Shade (44 dmg). Suicune has ~120 HP. Use twice for Red health.
- Item: Ultra Balls (32).

# Strategic Plans: Locate Suicune
## The Great Spiral (Intended Route)
- Entrance: (27, 44).
- Channel Entrance: (27, 30).
- Maze Logic (Spiral Inward):
  1. Lane 1 (X=27-29): Sail North to Gap 1 at (26, 10).
  2. Lane 2 (X=23-25): Sail South to Gap 2 at (22, 16).
  3. Lane 3 (X=19-21): Sail South to Gap 4 at (18, 26).
  4. Lane 4 (X=17-18): Sail North to Gap 5 at (16, 20).
  5. Lane 5 (X=14-16): Sail North to (14, 10) and land.
- Current Status: At (22, 16) (Gap 2).
- Next Task: Sail South along Lane 3 (X=19-21) to Gap 4 at (18, 26).

# Reflection Turn 48083
- Error: Hallucinated Lane 2 as Northbound. Hit BUOY wall at (23, 9).
- Correction: Lane 2 is Southbound. Re-tracing spiral steps to reach Gap 2.
- Progress: Deep in the buoy maze. Super Repel active.
- Note: (18, 26) is Gap 4, leading to the final two lanes. Must reach it again.
