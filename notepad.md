## League Analyst Advice [Turn 35458]
- Evaluation: Team is top-heavy (Typhlosion 49, Graveler 48). Others are underleveled (Haunter 37, others <20).
- Key Threats: Will's Psychic-types (outspeed/OHKO Haunter). Lance's Dragonites (lack of Ice coverage).
- Recommendations:
  - Priority 1: Level XENON (Haunter) to 45+. Teach it TM24 DragonBreath if not evolved.
  - Priority 2: Replace ICARUS (Pidgey) and Ravioli (Krabby) with high-level encounters (e.g., Red Gyarados or gift Dratini).
  - Priority 3: Evolve KIMCHI (Gloom) using a Sun or Leaf Stone.
  - Priority 4: Use Gneiss (Graveler) with Earthquake for Koga/Bruno, but avoid Bruno's Fighting-types.
  - Strategy: Buy TM33 Ice Punch in Goldenrod for Typhlosion.
