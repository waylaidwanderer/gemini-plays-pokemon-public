# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Timestamp:** Turn 25496 (Jan 6, 2026)
- **Primary Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Immediate Task:** Reach the Northwest area of Silver Cave Outside.
- **Current Status:** Escaped the "Middle Pocket" (Row 32-33). Currently at (39, 31).
- **Finding:** The "Middle Pocket" is a dead end. All southern tiles (Row 34) are walls.
- **Action:** Exiting East to **Route 28**.
- **Goal:** Explore Route 28 to find a path that loops back into the inaccessible Northwest area of Silver Cave Outside.
- **Hypothesis:** The entrance to the NW area is likely a hidden path or cut-through on Route 28.

# Tile Mechanics & Observations
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT:** Standard one-way jumpable tiles.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Inconsistent behavior observed.
    - **Confirmed Ledge:** (39, 32) allowed jumping South.
    - **Confirmed Wall:** (6, 30) and (28, 34) blocked movement South.
    - **Strategy:** Treat as WALL unless verified otherwise.
- **Navigation Notes:**
    - The "Central" area (x=5) connects to the West path via Row 22 (re-verified via Mental Map).
    - Row 30 acts as a hard barrier across most of the map, separating the North and South sections.
