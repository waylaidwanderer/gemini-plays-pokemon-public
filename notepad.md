# Strategy: Suicune Hunt (Crystal)
- Sequence: 1. Burned Tower (Done) -> 2. Cianwood (Done) -> 3. Route 42 Island (Current) -> 4. Route 38 -> 5. Route 14 -> 6. Tin Tower 1F.
- Quest Start: Turn 20970 (Dec 25, 5:00 PM)
- Sighting 3 (Route 42): 
    - Verified in Pokedex at Turn 21303.
    - Status: Island Sweep started Turn 21330. Visited ALL island FLOOR tiles (Turn 21330-21340). Sprite did NOT appear.
    - Map reset via Mt. Mortar at Turn 21349.
    - Current Task: Verify Pokedex AREA map to see if sighting triggered silently.
- Sighting 4 (Route 38): Next destination if Sighting 3 is confirmed complete.
- Lessons Learned:
    - Pokedex Navigation: Alphabetical (A-Z). Suicune is after Spearow/Sudowoodo.
    - Scripted vs Roaming: Suicune is scripted until Sighting 5. Pokedex "AREA" dot is reliable.
    - Menu Stagnation: Do not loop in menus. Use tools/agents.
