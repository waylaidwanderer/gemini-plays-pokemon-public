# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
- **Quest Start:** Turn 49885
- **Current Status:** Executing the "Gem Corridor" (X=6) route.

## Active Strategy: The Gem Corridor (X=6)
The northern plateau (14, 10) is accessible via the western coastal highway (X=2). This route uses the X=6 corridor to bypass central walls and elevation traps.

### Execution Plan
1. Central Ascent: Walk North from (12, 47) to (12, 44), then West to (6, 44). (In Progress)
2. Terrace Sprint: Walk North along X=6 to (6, 18).
3. West Coast Entry: Walk West to (4, 18), South to (4, 20), and West to (2, 20).
4. Highway Dash: Walk North along X=2 to Row 10.
5. Final Approach: Walk East to (14, 10) and trigger Suicune.

## Verified Mechanics
- UP_WALL: Blocks DOWN movement. Moving UP is allowed. (e.g., (6, 34), (4, 20), (6, 46)).
- X=6 Corridor: Clear north-south path from Row 44 to Row 18.
- X=2 Highway: Clear north-south path from Row 20 to Row 10.

## Battle Plan: Eusine
- Expected Team: Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25).
- Lead: Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion). Strategy: Flamethrower.

## Failed Hypotheses
- Hypothesis 1: Land access via X=11 (blocked by Row 31 wall).
- Hypothesis 2: Direct Surf to beach (dead end).
- Hypothesis 3: Cut tree at (11, 13) (fake tree).
- Hypothesis 4: Southern loop via Row 51 (blocked by elevation traps).

## Map Markers (Obstacles)
- (5, 29), (10, 27), (4, 25), (4, 19): Smashable Rocks.
- (14, 10): Suicune trigger point.
- (5, 18): Western Bypass gap.
