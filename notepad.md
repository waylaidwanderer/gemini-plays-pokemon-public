- Item at (17, 21): Heading there now.

## Lessons Learned
- Menu Navigation: The main menu wraps around (POKEDEX <-> EXIT). Resetting with 8 Ups returns to the same position. Verify cursor before acting.

## Strategy: Reaching Azalea Town
1. Swap Calcifer (Quilava) to lead slot to preserve Gneiss's HP.
2. Navigate south through Union Cave 1F to Azalea Town.

## Battle Notes
- Gneiss is out of Rock Throw PP.
- Calcifer is the primary attacker for cave encounters.
- Rocky (Onix) is a backup tank.
