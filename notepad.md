# Strategy: Trigger Suicune Sighting (Started: Turn 51131)
- City Logic: The city is divided by vertical walls. The primary land gaps are at Row 33 (for X=9) and Row 35 (for X=5 and X=3). The Western Corridor (X=0-2) allows passage north through the Row 15 wall. Row 12 is a horizontal corridor that connects the western side to the sighting spot at (14, 10).
- Execution Plan:
  1. Navigate to (10, 33) to reach the gap in the X=9 wall.
  2. Walk West to (9, 33), then navigate to (6, 35) to cross the X=5 wall.
  3. Walk West to (2, 35) to enter the Western Corridor.
  4. Hike North through the Western Corridor to Row 12.
  5. Walk East to (14, 12) and North to (14, 10).
- Battle Prep: Lead Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion).
