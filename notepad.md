# Johto Elite Four Challenge - RESTART REQUIRED
- Status: Whited out against Champion Lance (Turn 37226).
- Progress: Must re-defeat Will, Koga, Bruno, and Karen.

## Strategy for Elite Four
1. **Will (Psychic):** Typhlosion (Return/Flame Wheel) or Haunter (Night Shade).
2. **Koga (Poison/Bug):** Typhlosion (Flame Wheel) or Graveler (Earthquake).
3. **Bruno (Fighting/Rock):** Haunter (Night Shade/Dream Eater) or Graveler (Earthquake).
4. **Karen (Dark):** Typhlosion (Flame Wheel/Return) or Graveler (Earthquake).

## Strategy for Champion Lance (The Wall)
- **Problem:** Dragonites are bulky and hit hard with Outrage/Hyper Beam.
- **Correction:** Calcifer (Typhlosion) and Xenon (Haunter) are NOT compatible with TM33 Ice Punch in Crystal.
- **Action:** Purchase Full Restores/Max Potions and Revives at Indigo Plateau Mart.
- **Alternative:** Consider catching a Jynx (Ice Path) or Lapras (Union Cave, Friday) for Ice coverage.
- **Alternative:** Use Gneiss (Graveler) with Rollout/Rock moves against Flying types.

## Team Status & Preparation
- Calcifer (Typhlosion, Lv54): Lead attacker. Needs Ice Punch.
- Gneiss (Graveler, Lv50): Physical tank, good for Aerodactyl/Charizard.
- Xenon (Haunter, Lv40): Needs more levels/utility.
- Resources: ¥12660. 2 Revives. 0 Potions.
