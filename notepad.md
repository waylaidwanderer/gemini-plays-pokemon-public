# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Challenge the Pokémon League.
- **Secondary:** Defeat Champion Lance.
- **Tertiary:** Become Champion.

# Current Status
- **Location:** Lance's Room.
- **Party:**
  - Muscle (Lv65): 215/215 HP. (PP Restored).
  - Gyarados (Lv35): 24/114 HP.
  - Mistral (Lv15): Fainted.
  - Zenith (Lv15): Fainted.
  - Others: Healthy (Fodder).
- **Inventory:** 0 Max Revives.

# Battle Log: Champion Lance
- **Vs Gyarados:** My Gyarados (QAAGMAQNJW) won via Thrash.
- **Vs Dragonite (Lv47):**
  - Muscle fainted to Hyper Beam.
  - Switched to Zenith.
  - Used Max Revive on Muscle (Dragonite recharged).
  - Zenith fainted to 2nd Hyper Beam.
  - **Current Situation:** Switching Muscle in. Dragonite MUST recharge.

# Plan
1.  **Muscle Enters:** Safe switch-in due to recharge.
2.  **Muscle Sweeps:**
    - **Vs Dragonite:** Strength (Free hit + Next turn).
    - **Vs Aerodactyl:** Cross Chop.
    - **Vs Charizard:** Strength.
- **Turn 19400:** Muscle active (Full HP/PP). Dragonite recharging.
- **Action:** Use Strength (Slot 1).
- **Reasoning:** Free hit. Best neutral damage option.
- **Next:** Dragonite will attack next turn. Muscle tanks and hits again.
- **CRITICAL:** Max Revive DID NOT restore PP (Glitch/Mechanic?).
- **Result:** Strength/Cross Chop still 0 PP.
- **New Strategy:** **Rock Smash Attrition** & **Intimidate Loop**.
  - Use Rock Smash (10 PP left).
  - Use Gyarados (Intimidate) to lower Dragonite's Atk if needed.
  - If PP runs out: Struggle.
- **Immediate Action:** Select Rock Smash (Slot 3). Dragonite recharging.
- **Reminder:** Mark warps at (4,1) and (5,1) after battle.
- **CRITICAL REALIZATION:** Max Revive ONLY restores HP in Gen 2. It does NOT restore PP.
- **Status:** Muscle has 0 PP for Strength/Cross Chop.
- **Offense:** Only have Rock Smash (10 PP) and Dig (Immune).
- **New Strategy (Rock Smash Attrition):**
  - Spam Rock Smash. Hope for Defense drops.
  - If PP runs out, use Struggle.
  - Zombie Loop: If Muscle faints, switch to fodder -> Revive Muscle -> Repeat.
- **Current Turn:** Use Rock Smash (Slot 3). Dragonite recharging.
- **Turn 19404:** Dragonite is recharging. Free turn.
- **Action:** Use Rock Smash (Slot 3).
- **Strategy:** "Rock Smash Attrition". Dragonite is at -3 Defense. Even resisted hits will add up.
- **Status:** Muscle Full HP. 9 PP left on Rock Smash.
- **Note:** Max Revive failure confirmed (Gen 2 mechanic). We grind from here.
- **Turn 19405:** Dragonite finished recharging.
- **Action:** Select Rock Smash.
- **Method:** Press A (Fight) -> A (Select Move, assuming cursor memory on Rock Smash).
- **Expectation:** Dragonite attacks (Hyper Beam/Wing Attack/Thunder Wave). Muscle uses Rock Smash.
- **Note:** If "No PP" appears, cursor was reset. Will correct next turn.
- **Turn 19406:** Cursor on Strength (0 PP).
- **Action:** Move Down x2 -> Rock Smash (Slot 3).
- **Reasoning:** Dragonite KO'd Zenith with Hyper Beam last turn. It MUST recharge this turn. Free hit.
- **Status:** Muscle Full HP. Rock Smash 9 PP.
- **Plan:** Grind Dragonite down with Rock Smash drops.
- **Turn 19407:** Cursor confirmed on Rock Smash (Slot 3).
- **Action:** Press A to Execute.
- **Context:** Dragonite is recharging from the Hyper Beam that KO'd Zenith.
- **Status:** Free hit. Muscle (Full HP) vs Recharge.
- **Turn 19408:** Clearing text "It's not very effective...".
- **State:** Dragonite finished recharging. It WILL attack this turn.
- **Action:** Select Rock Smash (Slot 3).
- **Sequence:** B (Clear) -> A (Fight) -> A (Rock Smash).
- **Prediction:** Dragonite attacks (Hyper Beam/Thunder Wave). Muscle uses Rock Smash.
- **Status:** Muscle Full HP. Rock Smash 8 PP.
