# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Objectives
- **Primary:** Traverse Route 34 to reach Goldenrod City.
- **Secondary:** Check Day-Care on Route 34.
- **Tertiary:** Find Headbutt Tutor (Deprioritized).

## Navigation
- **Location:** Route 34 (11_1).
- **Current Action:** Battling Youngster Ian.
- **Target:** Day-Care House (13, 15).

## Current Strategy
- **Status:** On Route 34.
- **Action:** Navigating to (10, 14).
- **Reasoning:**
    - The path North on the right side (cols 13+) is blocked by a fence at Row 21.
    - I must use the left path (col 10) to bypass Youngster Ian and the fence.
    - I will try the Warp at (11, 14) from (10, 14) to see if it enters the Day-Care.
    - If the warp fails, I will continue North to Goldenrod via Column 9.
- **Notes:** (11, 15) warp failed previously. (13, 21) confirmed as wall.

## Key Items & Progress
