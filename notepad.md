# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy

- **Secondary Goal:** Investigate Radio Tower (Team Rocket takeover).
- **Navigation:** Go to Radio Tower (Northwest Goldenrod).
- **Status:** Navigating West along Row 28 to reach the West side of Goldenrod (x=6).
- **Plan:**
    1. Navigate West to (6, 28).
    2. Turn North and travel up the West side of the city.
    3. Look for the Radio Tower entrance (likely Northwest).
    4. Confirmed: Row 27 is blocked by buildings, Row 28 is the clear path.

## Key Information
- **Turn 12001:** Rocket Grunt at (31, 10) is a non-battling blocker.
- **Underground:** "No Entry" door at (18, 6) requires a key or switch.
- **Radio Tower:** Rumored to be taken over.

## Tile Mechanics

## Reflections (Turn 12001)
- **Execution:** Good immediate responses.
- **Hygiene:** Notepad cleaned up. Grunt behavior noted.
- **Goals:** Clear outcome-focused goals.
- **Hypothesis:** Uniform is needed. If not on a Grunt, maybe it's in the locked room or with a specific NPC I missed.
- Obstacle: Rocket Grunt at (16, 23) blocks the shortcut west on Row 23.
- Navigation Note: The West side path at x=6 is blocked by walls at Row 4-5. Must use Main Street (x=18) to go North.
