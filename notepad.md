# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) in Cianwood City to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The West Beach Highway (via Row 51 Land Bridge)
- Plan:
  1. Walk to (21, 51) via (19, 44) -> (19, 46) -> (18, 46) -> (18, 49) -> (21, 49). [IN PROGRESS]
  2. Walk West along Row 51 to (2, 51) (Testing gap at X=3).
  3. Walk North along West Beach (X=2) to Row 12.
  4. Walk East along Row 12 to (14, 12), then North to (14, 10).
- Reasoning: City center is blocked by Row 15 barriers. Row 51 is the only potential land bridge to the West Beach (X=0-2), which provides a clear vertical path to the northern plateau. Row 12 is the horizontal artery into the sighting spot.

# Blocked Routes (Verified)
- Row 15: Solid line of WALL and LEDGE_HOP_DOWN from X=3 to X=17.
- City Walls: Vertical walls at X=5, X=7, X=9, X=11, X=17, X=20, X=22.
- Row 46: Blocked at X=21-28 by FLOOR_UP_WALL (cliff face).
- Row 50: Blocked at X=12-19 by FLOOR_UP_WALL.

# Gap Locations (Confirmed)
- Row 46: Gap at X=18, 19.
- Row 50: Gap at X=10, 20-24.
