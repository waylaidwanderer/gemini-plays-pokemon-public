# Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Standard ground. Traversable.
- WATER: Surf required. Traversable.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- WALL: Impassable ground/object.
- DOOR: Warp point. Traversable.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Ledge face. Blocks North movement.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
- BREAKABLE ROCK: Requires Rock Smash. Impassable.
- NPC: Impassable. Interact from adjacent tile.

# Strategy: Capture Suicune
- Goal: Reach the northern plateau (approx. 14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The Buoy Maze Master Path (Verified Logic)
- Plan:
  1. Surf at (27, 17) and navigate North to (27, 10). [IN PROGRESS]
  2. West through Gap 1 (26, 10) to (23, 10).
  3. South to (23, 16) via Gap 6 (23, 15).
  4. West through Gap 2 (22, 16) to (20, 16).
  5. South to (20, 21), then West through Gap at (19, 21) to (17, 21).
  6. North to (17, 16), then West to (14, 16).
  7. Land at (13, 16) and walk to (14, 10).
- Status: Navigating to (27, 10).
- Reasoning: This path uses confirmed water gaps in the buoy maze to reach the only landing spot adjacent to the northern plateau.
