# Quest Log
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.
- **Status:** Exploring Mt. Silver Cave 1F.
- **Next:** Traverse Cave to Red.

# Current Strategy: Post-Game
- **Location:** Silver Cave Room 1.
- **Status:** Relocating to West Edge (Column 0).
- **Action:** Navigate to (0, 35), then North to (0, 10).
- **Reasoning:** Central North path (Col 8) is blocked. Column 3 is blocked North of Row 14. Column 0 appears to be a clear corridor spanning the entire map height (Row 35 to Row 10), accessible via the bottom corridor (Row 35).
- **Goal:** Challenge Red at Mt. Silver.

# Tile Mechanics
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN:** One-way South.
- **LEDGE_HOP_LEFT:** One-way Left.
- **WARP_CARPET:** Step on to exit map.
- **CUT_TREE:** Obstacle unless Cut is used.
- **PIT:** Drops player to floor below.
- **LADDER:** Transitions between floors.
- **FLOOR_UP_WALL:** Walkable from South (Verified at 15,28). Northbound exit needs verification. Southbound entry blocked at (10,34). Likely context-dependent or hidden objects.
- **BUOY:** Water boundary/Wall.

# Reflection (Turn 25132)
- **Status:** Exploring Mt. Silver Cave 1F.
- **Hygiene:** Notepad and Map Markers are up to date.
- **Goals:** Clear. Exploring North to find Red.
- **Strategy:** Testing if FLOOR_UP_WALL tiles at Row 20 are traversable from the South.
