# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Strategy & Pathing
- **Goal:** Reach Azalea Town (West of Route 33).
- **Current Task:** Defeat Hiker Anthony.
- **Current Task:** Defeat Hiker Anthony.
- **Battle Status:** Rocky Fainted. Sending out Topaz (Lv4).
- **Situation:** Hopeless. Machop Lv11 vs Topaz Lv4.
- **Action:** Send out Topaz. Attack until fainted.
- **Outcome:** Whiteout inevitable.
- **Post-Battle Plan:**
    - Respawn at Center.
    - Heal.
    - **Strategy Adjustment:**
        - **Option A:** Grind Unakite/Rocky on wild mons in Union Cave.
        - **Option B:** Catch a Geodude/Sandshrew for better matchup? (Geodude resists Normal/Rock, but weak to Fighting. Sandshrew is Ground, neutral to Fighting).
        - **Option C:** Just play the Anthony fight better. Heal aggressively. Use Flash/Mud-Slap if available? (Garnet has Mud-Slap!).
        - **Mud-Slap:** Lowers accuracy. If Garnet can survive one hit, Mud-Slap could ruin Machop's day.
- **Map Notes:**
    - **Route 33:** Defeated here.
    - **Union Cave:** North.
