## Battle Strategy (Blackthorn Gym)
- Leader Clair: Dragonair Lv37 x3, Kingdra Lv40.
- Strategy: Typhlosion (Lv45) with Thunderpunch and Graveler (Lv44) with Earthquake. Jynx (Ice Path) is a good backup for Dragonairs.
- Catch List: Swinub (Common), Jynx (Rare). Use Sleep Powder (Kimchi) or Hypnosis (Xenon). Strategy Advisor says helpful but not strictly necessary.

## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Walkable. NOTE: B1F floor tiles do NOT slide. B2F floor tiles (non-islands) DO slide.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Needs Surf (HM03).
- ICE: Sliding mechanic. B1F northern corridor (Row 1-2) and B2F large rink. Moving onto ICE causes sliding until hitting non-ICE, wall, or object.
- PIT: Warp to B2F. Dropping a boulder fills the pit on B2F, creating a "stopper" tile.
- BOULDER: Pushable with Strength (HM04). Resets to start position when changing floors via ladder or pit. Verified.
- STRENGTH: Must be re-activated after every floor transition or battle. Verified.
