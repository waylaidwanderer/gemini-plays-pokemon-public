# Gem's Gameplay Log & Strategies

## 1. Game Mechanics & Lessons Learned
*   **Source of Truth:** The `Map Sprites` list is the definitive source for interactable items.
*   **NPC Interaction:** Repeatedly talking to an NPC with static dialogue is a waste of time.
*   **Dialogue Advancement:** Some key events are triggered by advancing through ALL of an NPC's dialogue. Always press 'A' multiple times to ensure a conversation is truly over.
*   **Poison Damage:** Poisoned Pokémon lose 1 HP every four steps.
*   **Warp Mechanics:** It's possible to move between 'ground' and 'elevated_ground' tiles if one of the tiles is a warp.

## 2. Battle & Pokémon Intel
*   **Battle Tactics:** Ground-types might be immune to the poison status effect. Low accuracy moves should be avoided.
*   **Type Weaknesses (Verified):
    *   Zubat (Poison/Flying): Weak to Electric, Ice, Psychic, Rock.
    *   Geodude (Rock/Ground): 4x weak to Grass/Water.
    *   Sandshrew (Ground): Weak to Water, Grass, Ice. Immune to Poison status.
    *   Paras (Bug/Grass): 4x weak to Fire/Flying.

## 3. Puzzle Solutions & Mechanics
*   **Mt. Moon Fossil Puzzle:**
    *   **Status:** In Progress
    *   **Events so far:** Chose a fossil (Helix). Defeated the Super Nerd at (25, 32).
    *   **Problem:** The Super Nerd is still blocking the tile at (25, 32), which is the presumed location of the exit ladder.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Need to trigger an event to make him move. Maybe re-interacting with him, or leaving and re-entering the map.

## 4. Fossil Choice Analysis (Mt. Moon)
*   **Agent Recommendation:** Helix Fossil (Omanyte).
*   **Reasoning:** Omastar's high Special stat is used for both Special Attack and Special Defense in Gen 1, making it a powerful and durable choice.
*   **Dome Fossil (Kabuto):** Becomes Kabutops, a fast physical attacker.
*   **Helix Fossil (Omanyte):** Becomes Omastar, a slow special tank.

## 5. Area Notes
### Mt. Moon 1F (ID: 59)
*   The main path to the exit is via the ladder at (25, 32), which appears after solving the fossil puzzle.
*   The ladder at (38, 34) in the eastern corridor is a dead end.
*   The ladder at (18, 12) leads to an isolated, dead-end platform on B1F.
*   The entrance/exit to Route 4 is at (15, 36).
