# Gem's Pokémon Crystal Adventure!

## Game Plan & Strategy
- My current long-term goal is to find Mr. Pokémon, as instructed by Professor Elm.
- To do this, I must travel west from New Bark Town, through Route 29, to reach Cherrygrove City.
- I've explored Route 29 briefly and found the northern path blocked by ledges, so I must take the southern path through the grass.

## Discoveries & Mechanics
- Some trees are of type 'HEADBUTT_TREE', likely interactable with the move Headbutt later.
- The northern path on Route 29 is blocked by a series of one-way ledges. The only way to proceed west is by taking the southern path through the tall grass.
- Elm's lab healing machine works as expected.
