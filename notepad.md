# I. Core Principles & Lessons Learned
- **Immediate Action is Non-Negotiable:** Deferring tasks like tool fixes, agent creation, or documentation is a critical failure. All such actions must be performed in the current turn.
- **Systematic Hypothesis Testing:** When faced with a puzzle, I must form single, testable hypotheses and design minimal experiments. I will document each test, its outcome, and my conclusion to avoid repeated failures.
- **Trust But Verify Agents:** Agents provide powerful plans, but they may lack complete information. Follow their plans, but be prepared to pivot and gather more data when a plan fails.

- **closed_gate:** An impassable gate that is currently visible on the screen.
