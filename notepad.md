# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Challenge the Pokémon League.
- **Secondary:** Defeat Champion Lance.
- **Tertiary:** Become Champion.

# Post-Mortem: Lance Attempt #1
- **Result:** Loss vs Champion Lance (Final Dragonite).
- **Key Issues:**
  - Ran out of Revives (Started with 8, burned all).
  - Muscle ran out of PP (Struggle recoil hastened defeat).
  - Team support (Garnet, Gyarados) is too frail to tank hits for safe switches.
- **Takeaway:** Need MAX Revives and Hyper Potions. Muscle needs full PP. Maybe grind a bit?
- **Lance's Team:** Gyarados, Dragonite x2 (Lv47), Charizard, Aerodactyl, Dragonite (Lv50).

# Current Plan
1. **Heal:** Enter Indigo Plateau Lobby (Done).
2. **Shop:** Buying supplies (Done).
   - Bought: 5 Revives (7500).
   - Bought: 5 Hyper Potions (6000).
3. **Rest & Restore:** Talk to Nurse Joy to fully heal (HP/PP).
4. **Re-Challenge:** Go back in.

# Team Status
- Muscle (Lv65): Carry.
- Others: Fodder/Pivot.
- Money: 219.
- Inventory: 5 Revives, 5 Hyper Potions, 8 Full Heals.

# Tile Mechanics

- **LADDER**: Warp. Transitions between floors.
- **WARP_CARPET_DOWN**: Warp. Transitions to a different map (usually south).
