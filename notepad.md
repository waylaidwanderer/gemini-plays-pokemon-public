# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Challenge the Pokémon League.
- **Secondary:** Defeat the Elite Four.
- **Tertiary:** Train team.

# Current Status
- **Location:** Will's Room (Elite Four).
- **Party:** Healthy. Muscle (Lv61) leading.
- **Inventory:** 6 Hyper Potions, 10 Revives, 2 Full Restores.
- **Money:** Low (¥589).

# Exploration Log
- **Victory Road:** Fully traversed.
- **Indigo Plateau:** Lobby explored. Shopping done.

# Plan
1.  **Battle:** Talk to Will and win.
    - **Strategy:** Muscle (Lv61) spams Strength.
    - **Reasoning:** Strength (Normal) is neutral vs all his dual-Psychic types (Flying, Ice, Grass, Water). Cross Chop (Fighting) is resisted by Psychic and Flying, making it poor vs Xatu, Exeggutor, Slowbro.
    - **Matchup:** Muscle outlevels by ~20 levels. Expect OHKOs.
2.  **Next:** Advance to Koga's room.

# Battle Log
- **Vs Will:**
  - **Xatu:** Defeated.
  - **Jynx:** Current opponent.
    - **Status:** Muscle 108/205 HP. Jynx Full HP.
    - **Speed:** Jynx is faster.
    - **Action:** Muscle uses STRENGTH.
    - **Outcome Prediction:** Jynx uses Psychic (~90 dmg). Muscle survives with <20 HP. Strength OHKOs Jynx.
- **Turn 19117:** Previous attempt failed to register (inputs eaten by lag/animation?). Menu is stable now. Cursor on PACK.
- **Action:** Manual Input: Up (FIGHT) -> A -> A (STRENGTH).
- **Status:** Muscle 108/205. Committing to attack to break the heal loop.
- **Turn 19118:** Cursor confirmed on FIGHT.
- **Action:** Manual Input: A (Select Fight) -> A (Select Strength).
- **Prediction:** Jynx attacks (Muscle survives ~14 HP). Strength kills Jynx.
- **Turn 19119:** Menu confirmed open. Selecting STRENGTH.
- **Contingency:** If Muscle faints (Crit), send **Sneasel** (Immune to Psychic, Resists Ice). Use Shadow Ball.
- **Turn 19120:** Declined switch (initially).
- **Revision:** Changing mind! Switching to **Sneasel**.
- **Reasoning:**
  1. Exeggutor will likely use Psychic (Super Effective on Muscle).
  2. Sneasel is immune to Psychic. Safe switch-in.
  3. Sneasel (Faster) uses **Screech** (-2 Def) then dies.
  4. Muscle returns and OHKOs -2 Def Exeggutor with Strength.
- **Action:** Up (Select YES) -> A (Confirm). Next turn: Select Sneasel.
- **Turn 19122:** Switching to **Kunai (Sneasel)**.
- **Matchup:** Sneasel vs Exeggutor.
- **Prediction:** Exeggutor uses Psychic (Immune). Sneasel enters safely.
- **Next Turn:** Use Shadow Ball (Super Effective) or Screech.
- **Turn 19123:** Confirming switch to Kunai (Sneasel).
- **Strategy:** Sneasel absorbs Psychic (Immune).
- **Follow-up:** Sneasel uses Shadow Ball (Super Effective) or Screech. If Sneasel faints, Muscle returns to finish.
- **Turn 19126:** Kunai used Shadow Ball (Super Effective, ~40% dmg). Exeggutor used Egg Bomb (Missed).
- **Situation:** Kunai (Full HP) vs Exeggutor (~60% HP).
- **Action:** Shadow Ball again. Expecting Kunai to outspeed.
- **Contingency:** If Kunai faints, Muscle finishes with Strength.
- **Turn 19127:** Kunai fainted (Crit Egg Bomb).
- **Strategy:** Send **Muscle** (108 HP).
- **Matchup:** Muscle (Faster) vs Exeggutor (60% HP).
- **Prediction:** Strength deals ~95% of remaining HP. Muscle likely faints to Psychic.
- **Cleanup:** Finish low HP Exeggutor with Garnet (Quick Attack) or Gyarados. Revive Muscle after battle (or during if needed).
