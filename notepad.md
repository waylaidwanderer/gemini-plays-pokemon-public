# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Deposit a Pokemon to receive Dratini.

# Current Status (Turn 18370)
- **Location:** Dragon's Den 1F (5, 15).
- **Action:** Testing Exit Warp at (5, 15).
- **Context:** Arrived here via Ladder from B1F. (5, 15) is a Warp Carpet blocked by a wall below. Trying to trigger it by entering from the North.
- **Connection:** B1F (20, 3) Ladder -> 1F (5, 15) Warp/Arrival.

# Plan
1. Step Up to (5, 14).
2. Step Down to (5, 15) to attempt warp trigger.
3. If successful, go to Blackthorn PC.
4. If unsuccessful, find path to Main Exit at (3, 5).

# Tile Mechanics
- **Warp Carpet (5, 15):** Seems to require specific entry direction (North?) or is inactive.
- **Row 11 Wall:** Blocks direct path North. Must navigate via Col 9?

# Tile Mechanics
- **Whirlpool:** Barrier.
- **Buoy:** Barrier.
- **Column 28:** The secret passage.
