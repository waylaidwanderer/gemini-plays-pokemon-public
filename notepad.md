# Suicune Quest (Crystal) - FIXED SIGHTINGS
- Milestone 1: Burned Tower (Seen).
- Milestone 2: Cianwood City (Seen). Defeated Eusine.
- Milestone 3: Route 42 (In Progress). Pokedex confirms location.
- Milestone 4: Route 36 (Next). Requirement: Complete Route 42 sighting.

## Suicune Hunt Strategy
- Suicune is NOT a roamer in grass until after the Tin Tower event.
- Route 42 Trigger: Approach the island center. Current Hypothesis: Approach from the WEST via Surf (Started Turn 17681).
- Route 36: Enter from the Violet City side (East) after Route 42 is completed.

## Suicune Trigger Hypothesis Testing (Route 42)
- Hypothesis 21: Systematic floor sweep (Y=10-17) failed. No trigger on any FLOOR tile. [Turns 17654-17664]
- Hypothesis 22: Trigger requires entering Route 42 from the WEST (Ecruteak side) and approaching the island center. [Started Turn 17681]
- Attempt 1: Paced island center and fruit trees thoroughly (Turn 17710-17730). Result: FAILED. No sighting triggered.
- Hypothesis 23: Sighting is triggered on the mainland path or water, not the island itself.
- Hypothesis 24: Sighting requires approaching from the EAST (Mahogany side).
- Step 1: Fly to Mahogany Town. [DONE]
- Step 2: Enter Route 42 from the East. [DONE]
- Step 3: Surf to the island. [In Progress]
