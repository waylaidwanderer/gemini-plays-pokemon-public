# Mt. Moon Navigation Notes

## Current Strategy
- **Objective:** Defeat the Youngster at (13, 17) on the elevated platform.
- **Rationale:** This trainer guards the entrance to the large, unexplored western maze, which contains the only remaining reachable ladder on this floor. My previous attempts to find a path on the lower levels were a complete failure. Accessing and clearing this maze is the only logical path forward.

# Battle Learnings

- **Type Matchups:**
  - Electric is NOT very effective vs. Bug/Grass (Paras).
  - Electric is NOT very effective vs. Grass/Poison (Oddish, Bellsprout).
- **Risk Management:** Do not switch in low-level, non-resistant Pok√©mon to weaken wild encounters. It's too risky.

# Agent Reliability

- **`master_pathfinder_agent`:** This agent is **UNRELIABLE** in Mt. Moon. It has failed multiple times by routing through impassable walls and up ledges. Do not use for long-distance navigation on this map.

# Dungeon Mechanics Update
- **Defeated Trainers:** The defeated Rocket Grunt on Mt. Moon B2F at (16, 23) *is* an impassable obstacle, similar to trainers on Route 3.
