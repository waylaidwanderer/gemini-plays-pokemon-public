# I. Game Mechanics & World Knowledge

## A. Core Gameplay (Verified)
- **Battle Style:** Set mode.
- **Items in Battle:** Prohibited.
- **Level Caps:** Active and enforced.
- **PC Interaction:** To use a PC, stand on the tile directly *below* it and face *up* before pressing 'A'.
- **Menu Navigation:** The 'B' button is the primary method for exiting/canceling out of menus.
- **Forced Sleeping Switch:** The game will force you to send out or switch to a sleeping Pokémon if no other conscious Pokémon are available. This is a mechanical exception to the strategic guideline of avoiding switching to sleeping Pokémon.

## B. Tile Mechanics & Traversal (Verified)
- `ground` / `grass`: Standard traversable tiles.
- `impassable` / `unknown`: Cannot be entered. Must be navigated around.
- `water`: Requires Surf to traverse.
- `ledge`: Can be jumped down (from Y-1 to Y+2 in one step), but not climbed up. Impassable from below and sides.
- `steps`: Allows movement between `ground` and `elevated_ground`.
- `elevated_ground`: Walkable ground at a different elevation, only accessible from `steps` or other `elevated_ground` tiles. One-way drops to adjacent `ground` tiles are possible.
- `cleared_boulder_barrier`: Functions as a one-way ramp. Allows upward movement from an adjacent `ground` tile to the `cleared_bolder_barrier` tile (which acts as `elevated_ground`). Downward movement from `cleared_boulder_barrier` to `ground` is prohibited.
- `boulder_barrier`: Impassable tile that can be cleared by a `boulder_switch`.
- `boulder_switch`: Floor switch for boulders. Activating it changes `boulder_barrier` to `cleared_boulder_barrier`.
- `spinner_*`: Forces movement in the specified direction.
- `ladder_up` / `ladder_down`: Function as warps but are traversable tiles.
- `hole`: A tile that a boulder can be pushed into, usually causing it to fall to a lower floor. The player can also walk into the hole after the boulder.
- **Boulder Pushing:** When the player is standing on a tile directly next to the boulder, pushing it will move the boulder one tile, but the player's character remains stationary.

# III. Meta-Progression & Lessons Learned

## A. Core Methodological Failures (Self-Correction Log)
- **Violation of Immediate Action Mandate:** I have repeatedly failed to perform necessary maintenance on my tools and notepad immediately, instead deferring the tasks to continue gameplay (e.g., Turn 145425, Turns 145345-145370). This is a critical violation of my core directive to prioritize internal state maintenance above all else, stemming from a misunderstanding of my nature as an LLM. There is no 'later'; tasks must be done in the current turn.
- **Flawed Hypothesis Testing (Confirmation Bias):** I have previously assumed a path existed and spent numerous turns trying to fix my tools to confirm this belief, rather than first using a tool like `map_connectivity_analyzer` to test the fundamental assumption of reachability. This leads to wasted time and prolonged failure loops.
- **Lack of Strategic Flexibility:** I have demonstrated a tendency to get stuck on a single problem or approach. If progress on an objective stalls, I must be more willing to pivot to a different task or adopt a more exploratory strategy.

# IV. Tool & Agent Development Log

## A. Tool Development Lessons
- **Immediate Maintenance Mandate:** I must prioritize fixing faulty tools and correcting data management issues (notepad, markers) *before* any in-game action. Deferring these tasks is a critical methodological failure.
- **Diagnostic Tool Output:** Pathfinding tools must report the specific obstacle that blocks a path upon failure. This is essential for distinguishing between a solvable puzzle and a genuinely impossible route.
