### Strategic Reflection (Turn 8719)
- **Status**: Stuck in Goldenrod for ~100 turns.
- **Issue**: Oscillating between East/West without clearing the "fog of war".
- **Insight**: The North-East (Flower Shop) is a cul-de-sac. The Central North Wall seems solid. The only remaining option is the North-West quadrant, which is largely "unseen".
- **Action Plan**: 
    1. Return to Main Street (y=10).
    2. Move West to x=6.
    3.Systematically explore North from there, hugging the West edge.

### Navigation Notes
- **Location**: Goldenrod City (Central -> South-West).
- **Goal**: Investigate NPC Block at Radio Tower.
- **Status**: At (6, 7). Moving to Radio Tower (5, 15).
- **Plan**: 
    1. Cross tracks at x=8 (verified walkable).
    2. Go to Radio Tower entrance.
    3. Talk to/Inspect NPC at (4, 16).
- **Hypothesis**: The path North is past the NPC on the West side.

### Quest Chain: SquirtBottle
1. **Defeat Whitney**: Done (Plain Badge obtained).
2. **Find Floria**: Currently seeking at Route 36.
3. **Get Bottle**: Return to Flower Shop after meeting Floria.

### Key Locations
- **Game Corner**: (9, 5).
- **Radio Tower**: (5, 15).
- **NPC Block**: (4, 16).
