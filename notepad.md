# Active Strategy: The Suicune Pursuit
- **Immediate Goal:** Trigger Suicune sighting at (14, 10) in northern Cianwood.
- **Battle Prep:** Lead with Lv64 Calcifer to sweep Eusine.
- **Plan (The Grand Loop):**
  1. Currently at (18, 47). Move East to (21, 47).
  2. Move South to (21, 51) (Bypassing Row 50 Terrace Climbs via X=21 gap).
  3. Move West on Row 51 to (2, 51).
  4. Move North via X=2 corridor to (2, 12).
  5. Move East on Row 12 to (14, 12), then North to (14, 10) for the sighting.
- **Verification:** X=21 is a confirmed gap in the Row 50 terrace. X=2 corridor and Row 12 are clear of all barriers.
