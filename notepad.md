# Persistence Knowledge
## Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Traversable. Standard walking surface.
- WALL: Impassable.
- LADDER: Floor change (e.g. 1F to B1F).
- WARP_CARPET_DOWN: Map transition.
- COUNTER: Face and press A to interact.
- WATER: Requires SURF.
- LEDGE: Semi-traversable (jump down).
- GRASS: Wild encounter zone.
- HOLE: Fall to floor below.

## Active Quest: Find Granddaughter
- Started: Turn 37715. Timestamp: Friday, January 9, 2026 at 5:17 PM PST.
- Status: Investigating B1F. Sailors at (30, 6) and (31, 6) are blocking the northern corridor.
- Strategy: Talk to both sailors to trigger their movement. The "lazy" sailor buddy quest is active.
- Target: Reach western corridors (x=28, x=25) via row 5.
- Obstacle: Super Nerd at (26, 9) is a trainer and blocks the x=26 corridor.
- Hypothesis: Talking to the sailor at (31, 6) after finding his buddy will clear the path.

## Kanto Strategy
- Goal: Collect 8 Kanto badges.
- Target 1: Lt. Surge (Vermilion City).
- MVP: GNEISS (Graveler) Lv 51. Ground-type immunity to Electric.

## Lessons Learned
- XENON (Haunter) is immune to Normal moves.
- Status: Paralysis reduces speed by 75%.
- NPCs like sailors may swap positions or block corridors until specific dialogue is triggered.
- Map transitions reset NPC positions.
- Super Nerd at (26, 9) acts as a wall and blocks the corridor at x=26.
- Lesson: Keep warp markers (like ladders) permanent for efficient navigation.
