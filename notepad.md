# Hall of Fame Entry
- **Achievement:** **CHAMPION OF THE JOHTO LEAGUE!**
- **Date:** Turn 33314
- **MVP:** Muscle (Machoke) Lv88.

# Reflection (Turn 35045)
- **Lesson:** Shop inventory varies significantly. Kanto Marts (Viridian/Vermilion) lacked Repels entirely. Goldenrod 2F Bottom Clerk only has standard Repels. Top Clerk appears to be Medicine-focused.
- **Strategy:** If Top Clerk lacks Super/Max Repels, I will compromise and buy standard Repels from the Bottom Clerk to avoid further delays. 
- **Efficiency:** Better to hunt with standard Repels than spend 50 turns finding Super ones.

# Roamer Hunt Log
- **Session Start:** Turn 34090.
- **Status:** In Ecruteak. Attempting to open Pokegear Map (Retry).
- **Issue:** Previous attempt to select Map card failed (Input 'Right' didn't move cursor from 'BACK').
- **Strategy:** Open Pokegear, verify cursor, then switch to Map.
- **Plan:** Fly to Ecruteak -> Roamer Hunt.
- **Note:** Bottom Clerk (13,6) sells: Poke/Great Ball, Escape Rope, Repel, Revive, Full Heal, Doll, Mail. Top Clerk (13,5) sells Medicine.
- **Pattern:** Circle grass (16 steps) -> Shuffle Ecruteak -> Repeat.
- **Interruption:** Received call from Cooltrainer Gaven (Turn 35087). Restarting map check.
- **Observation:** Roamers located on Route 38 and Route 42.
- **Action:** Closing Pokegear to shuffle locations by moving to Route 37.
