- LEDGE_HOP_LEFT: One-way West jump (2 tiles).
- CAVE: Warp leading to interior.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable wall above floor.

## Progress
- Badges: Zephyr (Violet City), Hive (Azalea Town).
- Current Goal: Reach Goldenrod City via Ilex Forest.
- Post-Battle Plan (Azalea Town Map 8_0):
  - Explore unseen tile at (24, 15) near the Gym.
  - Explore potentially reachable unseen tiles in the NE (31, 0) to (39, 2). Hypothesis: Reachable via unseen path or hidden gap.
  - Rocket Grunt at (31, 9) confirmed gone.
  - Check Kurt at (3, 2) in Kurt's House (Map 8_3) for the ball. Gave White Apricorn on Turn 2720.

## Strategy for Ilex Forest
1. Enter Ilex Forest from the western gate of Azalea Town (Warp at 2, 10 or 2, 11).
2. Help the Charcoal Kiln's apprentice catch the runaway Farfetch'd.
3. Obtain HM01 (Cut).
4. Teach Cut to a compatible Pokémon.
5. Clear the small tree blocking the path to Goldenrod City.
