# Strategy: The Suicune Pursuit
- **Objective:** Trigger Suicune sighting at (14, 10).
- **Eusine Battle Prep:** Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25). Lead with Lv64 Calcifer.
- **Navigation Plan (South Bypass):**
  1. Land at (19, 30).
  2. Walk to (6, 46) [Terrace Climb].
  3. Walk West to (2, 46).
  4. Walk North to (2, 10).
  5. Walk East to (14, 10).
- **Note:** Rocks respawn upon map transition. (6, 46) is a verified terrace climb point.

# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard traversable terrain.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable terrain.
- WATER: Traversable only with Surf.
- DOOR / WARP_CARPET: Map transition points.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Allows jumping down (South) but blocks movement from the opposite direction (North).
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Terrace edges. (6, 46) allows climbing West onto the terrace.
- ROCK (Object): Blocks movement; can be cleared with Rock Smash. Respawns upon map transition.

# Lessons Learned
- **Cianwood Pathing:** (11, 15) and (12, 14) are dead ends for northern access. Use the far-left corridor (X=0-2) via the South Bypass (6, 46).
- **Surf Navigation:** Buoy barriers heavily partition the water. Landing and walking is often more reliable.
- **Poke Seer's House:** (5, 17) is a regular interior, not a shortcut.
