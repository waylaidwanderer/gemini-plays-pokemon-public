# Gameplay Notes & Strategy
## Navigation & Exploration
*   North map connection from Route 3 leads to 'Route 4 (Before Mt. Moon)' lower tier (loop).
*   Route 4 (Before Mt. Moon) upper tiers: navigate eastward by descending ledges.
*   **Path Planning:** Manually plan complex paths in segments. Review screen/map memory.
*   **Item Acquisition:** Pick-up items are visible sprites in `Map Sprites` after trigger.
*   **NPC Interaction:** Max 3-4 attempts for mobile NPCs; assume non-battling/defeated if no engagement.
*   **Notepad Management:** Consolidate updates during planning phases.

## Battle Strategy
*   Precise battle menu navigation. Mind type matchups & PP. Internalize ROM hack type changes.
*   **Risk Assessment:** Avoid switching low HP Pokémon against KOs. Run if party critical (unless training overrides).
*   **Healing Priority:** Pokémon Center if key Pokémon critically injured & no immediate objective outweighs.

## ROM Hack Specifics
*   **General:** Old Rod (Viridian Mart), HMs forgettable/menu use, TMs repurchasable, Trade evos by level.
*   **Type Matchups (CRITICAL):** Ghost (Special) SE vs Psychic. Bug no longer SE vs Poison. Grass 0.25x vs Poison/Flying. Poison NVE vs Zubat. Bug SE vs Poison (likely 2x, so 4x vs Grass/Poison like Gloom).
*   **Stat Boosts:** Pikachu, Farfetch’d, Venomoth, Onix.
*   **Level Caps:** Misty (Starmie Lv21 -> Cap 21), Lt. Surge (Raichu Lv28 -> Player Cap 24).

# Key Learnings & Rules

## Navigation & Map Mechanics
*   NPCs on `navigable: false` tiles are physical obstacles; their tile remains non-navigable.
*   Ledges: Upward movement onto a ledge from below is prevented, even if `navigable="true"`.
*   Mt. Moon 1F: (8,19) is impassable, blocking south from (8,18).
*   **Segmented Dungeons:** Complex dungeons (e.g., Mt. Moon) have isolated segments per floor, accessed via specific warps. Systematically explore warps.
*   **1x1 Warps:** Step off and back on if activation is tricky (consider Pikachu).
*   Trust game state `reachable: no` for warp/object accessibility.

## Battle & EXP Mechanics
*   **EXP at Level Cap:** Pokémon at cap (e.g., BELLA Lv21) gain NO EXP, despite message.
*   Prioritize healing if party critical (outside of strategic sacrifices).

## Type Matchup Discoveries
*   Poison-type moves are Not Very Effective (NVE) against opposing Poison-type Pokémon (observed: Acid vs Ekans).

# Key Learnings & Rules (Continued)
*   AI Critique Learnings (Turn 9256): Be more methodical in navigating segmented dungeons. Rigorously cross-reference warp coordinates with destinations/entry points from Game State Info before committing to a path. Disengage from non-progressive NPC dialogue loops sooner. Use `exploration_prioritizer_agent` and `objective_validator_agent` more proactively when uncertain or validating targets.

# Agent Performance Notes
*   `dungeon_navigator_agent` has proven highly unreliable in complex, multi-level areas like Mt. Moon B2F, consistently generating invalid paths. Prioritize manual exploration or very short, verifiable agent paths in such areas.

# AI Critique Learnings & Game Mechanics

## System Interaction Notes
*   Turn Count Mismatch: System noted a turn count mismatch at turn 9326 (reported 9325, actual 9326). Current turn is 9327 (at time of critique). Must be vigilant with `validation_checks` turn number.

## Agent Development & Usage
*   Path Validator Agent: Created `path_validator_agent` (Turn 9325, then again at Turn 9361) to verify navigation paths, especially in complex areas where `dungeon_navigator_agent` proved unreliable (e.g., Mt. Moon B2F).

# Route 4 Navigation Notes
*   Encountered an impassable barrier at X=63 (extending from Y=10 to Y=15). Bypassed it by taking a northern path along Y=9, starting from (62,9) eastward.

# Cerulean Gym Strategy (vs Misty - Cap Lv21)
*   **Team & Prep:**
    *   CRITICAL: Level ZAPPY (PIKACHU) to Lv21. Currently Lv18.
    *   Ensure ZAPPY and BELLA (GLOOM) are at full health with sufficient PP.
    *   Other party members (NINA, ECHO, LUNA, SIR) are underleveled; use as pivots if necessary.
*   **Lead Pokémon:** BELLA vs Staryu (Lv18). Use STUN SPORE, then ABSORB. Switch to ZAPPY if Staryu uses Harden excessively or BELLA is at risk.
*   **Matchups:**
    *   vs Staryu (Lv18 Water): BELLA (Stun Spore, Absorb).
    *   vs Goldeen (Lv18 Water): ZAPPY (Thundershock). BELLA is weak to Peck; switch if BELLA faces it.
    *   vs Starmie (Lv21 Water/Psychic, knows Psychic moves): ZAPPY. Use THUNDER WAVE first, then THUNDERSHOCK. BELLA is very weak to Psychic.
*   **General Tips:**
    *   Misty has 3 Pokémon. Lead and ace have Psychic moves.
    *   Utilize status moves (Stun Spore, Thunder Wave) for speed control.
    *   Plan switches carefully due to 'Set' battle style.
    *   Conserve ZAPPY's Thundershock PP for Starmie if possible.

- Swimmer (ID CERULEANGYM_SWIMMER) at (Cerulean Gym 9,8) - Defeated. Pokémon: Horsea Lv16, Shellder Lv16.

## Cerulean Gym Mechanics
*   Can cross single-tile water gaps between two ground tiles (e.g., (10,5) to (8,5) over (9,5) water).
