## Pokemon Locations
- Route 29: Hoppip (Splash)
- Route 29 Navigation: Westbound path blocked by trees at x=37 (y=12-15). Must go south to y=16 to bypass.
- Successfully bypassed tree blockade. Continuing west on the lower path.
- Youngster at (27, 16) on Route 29 advises that weak Pokemon should stay out of grass.
- Route 29: Lower path dead-ends at x=14. Must backtrack to x=23 to go north through a gap in the ledge.
- Route 29: Path at x=21 blocked by CUT_TREE. Must backtrack East to x=44 to find a path North around the ledge.
- Route 29: Vertical Ledges at x=28 act as one-way gates allowing movement West but blocking movement East. Must go around them at y=14-16 to go East.
- Route 29: Vertical Ledge bypass confirmed. Go South to y=16, East to x=43, then North through gap at x=44.
