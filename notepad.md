# Strategic Notes
## Objectives
- **Primary:** Reach Indigo Plateau (Money Farming Loop).
- **Secondary:** Defeat Elite Four.
- **Tertiary:** Hunt Roamers (Raikou/Entei) - *Paused*.

## Current Task: Return to 1F and Explore Southeast
- **Location:** Victory Road 2F (ID: 3_91) at (3, 33).
- **Goal:** Return to 1F Ladder at (1, 35).
- **Reasoning:** 
  - Ledge at (3, 34) seems impassable or bugged.
  - Mental Map analysis of 1F shows a viable path to the East section via `(17, 56)`.
  - The West path (Ladder 1, 49) appears to be a dead end loop or return path.
  - New Plan: Go back to 1F, traverse South to Row 56, navigate through (13, 54) gap to reach Southeast corner, then head North.
- **Route:** `(3, 33) -> (1, 33) -> (1, 35) (Ladder Down)`.

## Status
- **Money:** ¥3294.
- **Party:** Gyarados (Lead), Lugia, Machoke, Pidgey, Oddish, Quilava.
