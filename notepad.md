# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement. Acts as a one-way ledge jumping North. Found at (10, 48), (12, 50), etc.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. One-way ledge jumping South. Found at (10, 15).
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- Start Turn: 49771
- Start Time: 3:29 PM

## Strategy: The Outer Sea Loop (Final)
The northern plateau (Row 10-12) is only accessible via the Western Corridor (X=0-2). The corridor is only accessible from the southern clearway (Row 51).
1. Walk to the Eastern Beach at (23, 32). (In Progress)
2. Surf South at X=24/25 to Row 51.
3. Land at (23, 51) or (24, 51).
4. Walk West along Row 51 to (2, 51) to enter the Western Corridor.
5. Walk North through the corridor to (2, 12).
6. Walk East along Row 12 to (14, 12).
7. Walk North to (14, 10) to trigger Suicune sighting.

# Progress Notes
- Verified: FLOOR_UP_WALL blocks South movement (Turn 49811).
- Verified: Central Pool is an enclosed pocket.
- Verified: Land routes to Row 51 are blocked by South-facing ledges.
- Note: No wild encounters on land. Out of Repels.
- Hypothesis: (14, 10) is the trigger point for the Suicune sighting.
