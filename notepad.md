# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Reach the Dragon Shrine via the East Whirlpool.

# Current Status (Turn 18313)
- **Location:** Dragon's Den B1F (26, 18).
- **Action:** Navigating North to row 10, then West to reach land.
- **Reasoning:**
    - The East Whirlpool path failed.
    - Exploration North reveals a large water body.
    - Mental Map shows land at (20, 9) (Ladder area).
    - Buoys seem to form a barrier at x=15 but stop around row 12, allowing access via row 10.
- **Goal:** Reach the land at (20, 9) and check if I can access the Dragon Shrine from there or if there's another path.

# Plan
1. Navigate to (20, 10).
2. Check for landing spots at (20, 9) or nearby.
3. Explore the land area (Ladder 1F is at 20, 3).
4. Find a way to the Dragon Shrine (19, 29).
