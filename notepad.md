- **Turn 16240:** Defeated Psychic Phil.
- **Turn 16222:** Confirmed Suicune not in Pokedex.
- **Route 44 Update:** North/East bank of 2nd lake (Zach's island) is a DEAD END (Ledges block Eastward travel).
- **Correction:** Path to Blackthorn must be via the South Path, accessible from the 1st lake (likely landing South at x=27).
- **Next Step:** Backtrack to 1st lake and explore South bank.
- **Turn 16312:** Defeated Cooltrainer Cybil. Proceeding East on South Path to Blackthorn City.
- **Turn 16322:** Defeated Cooltrainer Allen at (37,15).

- **Observation:** Spotted an Item Ball at (32, 23) in the eastern ice area, currently separated by a wall.
- **Observation:** Spotted another Item Ball at (35, 9) in the far North-East, currently unreachable from the low ground.
- **Correction:** The "South-East Path" was a dead end.
- **Hypothesis:** The way forward is likely jumping the ledge at (18, 24) to access the southern rows (25+).
- **Turn 16368:** Sliding Down from (19, 21) to (19, 23). Next: Move Right to (20, 23) to exit ice.
