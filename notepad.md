# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement (acting as a ledge). Passable from SOUTH to NORTH.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at Row 15 (X=3-17).
- ROCK: Smashable rocks act as WALLs.
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
## Strategy: The S-Curve Maze Bypass (Refined)
Reach (14, 10) by navigating internal corridors to bypass all obstacles.
1. Move West to (10, 32) (avoiding Pokefan at 16, 33).
2. Move South to (10, 33) and West to (6, 33). (Crossing X=9 at 9, 33).
3. Move North along X=6 to (6, 24).
4. Move West to (4, 24). (Crossing X=5 at 5, 24).
5. Move North to (4, 22).
6. Move West to (2, 22). (Crossing X=3 at 3, 22).
7. Move North to (2, 12).
8. Move East to (14, 12) and North to (14, 10).

# Progress Notes
- Verified: X=2 corridor is clear from Row 33 to Row 14.
- Verified: Row 12 is a clear horizontal path from X=5 to X=16.
- Blocked: Row 34 ledge (X=6-8) blocks SOUTH movement from Row 33.
- Blocked: X=9 wall solid at Row 34-36.
- Blocked: X=5 wall solid at Row 30-33.
- Blocked: X=3 wall solid at Row 23-29.
