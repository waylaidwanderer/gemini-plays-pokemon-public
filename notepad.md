# Gem's Pokémon Crystal Adventure!

## Current Plan & Strategy
- **Plan:**
  1. Exit Elm's Lab.
  2. Travel west through Route 29 to reach Cherrygrove City.
  3. Find Mr. Pokémon, who lives a little bit beyond Cherrygrove City.

## To-Do List

## Discoveries & Mechanics
- Some trees are 'HEADBUTT_TREE' type, likely for the move Headbutt.
- **Dialogue Triggers:** Some dialogues (like Professor Elm's initial errand speech) might loop until another specific NPC in the room is spoken to. In Elm's Lab, talking to the scientist was required to progress the conversation with Elm.

## World Knowledge & NPCs
- **Route 29:** The route splits. The main path forward is the upper/northern route. A smaller fork to the south is completely blocked by an impassable Youngster at (27, 16). A separate, smaller northern path accessible via ledges near (27, 12) is a dead end.
- **New Bark Town:** A Fisher at (12, 9) mentioned Prof. Elm discovered new Pokémon.

## Lessons Learned
- I need to be more diligent about checking my own notes and map markers before exploring. I got lost on a path I had already identified as a dead end.
