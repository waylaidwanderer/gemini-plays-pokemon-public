# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement. Passable East-West and North. Found at (6-8, 34), (10, 48), (12, 50), (16, 10).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. One-way ledge jumping South. Found at (10, 15).
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
- Start Turn: 49771
- Start Time: 3:29 PM

## Strategy: The Ultimate Sea Route (Final)
1. Clear Surf text and Surf East to column X=27. (In Progress)
2. Surf North along X=27 to Row 8 (Passing through (27, 9) buoy gap).
3. Surf West along Row 8 to (21, 8).
4. Surf Down to (21, 9), then West along Row 9 to (14, 9).
5. Surf South to land at (14, 10) and trigger Suicune sighting.

# Progress Notes
- Verified: (27, 9) is a gap in the buoy walls.
- Verified: (21, 9), (20, 9), (19, 9) are WATER, providing a passage West.
- Note: Out of Repels. Running from wild encounters.
- Hypothesis: (14, 9) is WATER, allowing landing at (14, 10).

# Reflection Turn (49821)
- Immediate Execution: Re-pivoting to the Sea Route. The land route is blocked by multiple one-way ledges (FLOOR_UP_WALL) that prevent southward travel to the necessary clearways. The Sea Route via X=27 and Row 8 is the only unobstructed path to the northern plateau.
- Notepad Hygiene: Strategy updated to the definitive plan.
- Error Analysis: Root cause of delay was misidentifying the landing point and the directional nature of city ledges.
