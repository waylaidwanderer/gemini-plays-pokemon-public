## Sighting Progress
1. Burned Tower: Verified.
2. Cianwood City (North): Verified.

4. Route 36 (Sudowoodo Junction): Pending. Checked once (Ecruteak entry).
5. Tin Tower 1F: Pending.

## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Traversable. Standard ground collision.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Traversable with SURF.
- CUT_TREE: Impassable; remove with CUT.
- GRASS / TALL_GRASS: Traversable; triggers encounters.
- CAVE / DOOR / WARP: Transitions.
- LADDER: Vertical transition.
- HEADBUTT_TREE: Impassable.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Traversable (ledges/stairs).

## Strategy
- Current: Test "Entry Direction" hypothesis. Fly to Mahogany and enter Route 42 from the East, then surf to the island.
- Alternative: Re-verify Wise Trio Room (Tin Tower Gatehouse) for any missed battles.
- Note: Suicune tracker insists on Route 42 island sighting #3.
