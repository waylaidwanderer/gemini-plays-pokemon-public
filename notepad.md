# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Standard walkable ground.
- WATER: Traversable only while Surfing (requires HM03).
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- WALL: Impassable obstacle.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL / LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Impassable from the north in Cianwood (verified at (6, 34), (12, 50), (23, 46)).
- Interaction: To Surf, face WATER from an adjacent FLOOR tile and press A. Stepping onto FLOOR from WATER automatically ends Surfing.

# Lessons Learned
- Cianwood's ledges are not standard; manual verification is required.
- Zig-zag buoy lines block the eastern sea. Gap found at (22, 8).
- Always reveal 'unseen' tiles manually before planning long routes through them.
