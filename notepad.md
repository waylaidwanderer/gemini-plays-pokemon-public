- Started: Friday, January 16, 2026

### Current Objectives
1. **Find Floria**: Located at Route 36 (North of Route 35).
2. **Get SquirtBottle**: Return to Flower Shop (19, 1) after finding Floria.
3. **Clear Sudowoodo**: Use SquirtBottle on Route 36.

### Navigation Status: Goldenrod City (Puzzle)
- **Goal**: Reach Route 35 (North).
- **Problem**: Main path blocked at (16, 4). East Path blocked at (32, 6) by fence.
- **Verified Dead Ends**:
    - **Sister's House Area (29, 5)**: Blocked.
    - **Alcove (31, 6)**: Blocked by fence.
    - **East House (33, 9)**: NPCs discussing PP. Likely no passage.
    - **Route 34 East Loop**: Blocked by fence at Row 3.
- **Confirmed Info**: Floria is at Route 36 (North of Goldenrod).
- **Navigation Plan**: 
    1. The North-East sector (Row 5-8, Col 20-35) seems to be a dead end (House, Gym).
    2. Return to Underground North Entrance (9, 5).
    3. Take Underground to South Entrance (11, 29).
    4. From South-West, navigate North along the West Edge (past Radio Tower) to reach Route 35.
- **Hypothesis**: The path to Route 35 is strictly on the West side of the city.

### Verified Locations

    - Underground Entrances: (11, 29) [South], (9, 5) [North]
- **Underground Halls (Map 3_54)**:

### Reflection (Turn 9251)
- **Progress**: Confirmed West tracks are a dead end.
- **Plan**: Enter Underground via South Entrance (11, 29).
- **Surface Navigation**: successfully exited Underground at (5, 25).
- **Strategy**: The area immediately North of the exit is blocked by planters.
    - Path found: Go South to Row 27, then West to the edge (x=1 or x=2), then North.
    - This aligns with the "Narrow Path" hypothesis.
- **Goal**: Navigate North along the West edge (x=2) to reach the Radio Tower/Route 35 area.
- **Blockage**: (2, 25) seems impassable despite looking like floor. Attempting to bypass via column 3.
- **City Layout**: Goldenrod appears divided into vertical strips.
    - **East Strip**: Flower Shop, Residence. Dead end North.
    - **Center Strip**: Enclosed/Blocked.
    - **West Strip**: Radio Tower, Route 35 Gate. Accessible via Underground or wrapping around South?
- **Plan**: Move South to Row 27, then West past Pokemon Center. If blocked, use Underground (11, 29) to reach West Side (5, 25) again and retry navigating North from there.
