# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) in Cianwood City to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The West Beach Highway (Land Route)
- Plan:
  1. Walk to (27, 46) and jump DOWN the ledge to (27, 47). [IN PROGRESS]
  2. Walk to (4, 51) then West to (2, 51) (Unseen).
  3. Walk North along West Beach (X=2) to (2, 12).
  4. Walk East along Row 12 to (14, 12), then North to (14, 10).
- Reasoning: The eastern side (PokeCenter) is separated from the northern plateau by Row 15 walls/ledges. The only potential path is to reach the West Beach (X=0-2) which appears to be a vertical corridor bypassing the northern barriers. Row 51 is the only identified land bridge from the east side to the west beach.

# Blocked Routes (Verified)
- Row 15: Solid line of WALL and LEDGE_HOP_DOWN from X=3 to X=17.
- City Walls: Vertical walls at X=5, X=9, X=11, X=17.
- Southern Ledge: Row 46 (X=6-28) is a south-facing cliff. Jump DOWN to reach the southern corridor.

# Failed Hypotheses
- Surfing Route: Blocked by east-facing ledge at X=15 (Advisor/Evaluator confirmed).
- Central City Land: Blocked by Row 15 barrier.

# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard ground. Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable.
- WATER: Surf required.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Impassable cliff face.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
