# Plan
1.  **Champion Lance:**
    - **Lead:** Muscle (26 HP). Sacrificial lead for clean switch.
    - **Vs Gyarados:** My Gyarados (Thrash/Bite).
    - **Vs Charizard/Aerodactyl:** My Gyarados (Surf).
    - **Vs Dragonites:** Muscle (Strength).
    - **Strategy:** Zombie Mode. Revive spam.

# Battle Log
- **Vs Bruno:** Victory.
- **Vs Karen:** Victory.
  - Muscle (26 HP) survived.
- **Next:** Champion Lance.
  - **Strategy:** "Zombie Mode" (Revive spam). Muscle is key.
  - **Lance's Team:** Gyarados, Dragonites (x3), Charizard, Aerodactyl.
  - **Matchups:**
    - Gyarados/Charizard/Aerodactyl: Weak to Rock/Electric. My Gyarados has Surf (Good vs Charizard/Aerodactyl/Rock-types).
    - Dragonites: Weak to Ice/Rock/Dragon. I have no Ice. Muscle's Strength is best bet.
    - **Plan:** Lead with Muscle (26 HP). Let him faint. Max Revive (Full HP) or Revive (50%).
    - **Note:** I have 1 Max Revive. Save for emergency? Or use early to establish dominance?
    - **Actually:** Use Mistral as fodder to revive Muscle.
