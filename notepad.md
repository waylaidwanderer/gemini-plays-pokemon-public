# Reflection & Strategy Notes (Turn 36288)
- **Menu Navigation:** The Pokegear cursor remembers its last position. To reliably open the Map, use `Left, Left` (forces cursor to BACK) then `Right` (selects MAP).
- **Roamer Behavior:** Observed persistent clustering on Route 38 and 44 for ~30 turns. If this persists for another 20 turns, consider relocating to Ecruteak/Route 37 to disrupt the pattern.
- **Shuffle Timing:** Warp transitions require ~5000-6000ms sleep in tools to be safe.
- **Session Stats:** Start: Turn 34090. Current: 36315.

# Tile Mechanics
- **Ledge Hop:** One-way jump over ledges.
- **Headbutt Tree:** Can be shaken for Pokemon.
- **WARP_CARPET_LEFT:** Map transition tile.
