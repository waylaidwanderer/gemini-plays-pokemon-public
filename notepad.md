# PC Storage (Box 1)
- Ravioli (KRABBY): Lv10 (Surf, Whirlpool)
- LAPIS (POLIWAG): Lv12 (Waterfall, Surf, Whirlpool)

# Tile Mechanics
- WATER: Traversable only via Surf.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- FLOOR: Standard walkable ground.
- WALL: Impassable obstacle.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Represents a ledge face. Impassable from the SOUTH (cannot walk north). Behaves as FLOOR from other directions.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump from NORTH to SOUTH.
- (11, 14): Dead End Pocket. Wall at (11, 13) and (12, 14) blocks access to the north plateau.
- (11, 15): Gap in the city wall (Y=15). Accesses the beach area but not the plateau.

# Quest Strategies
## Suicune: 'The Western Land Bridge' (Bypasses Everything)
- Discovery: The northern plateau (Suicune's spot) is connected to the western beach, which can be reached on land by navigating the far southern gap in the city walls.
- Route:
    1. From (5, 19), walk South to (5, 46).
    2. Walk West through the gap at (5, 46) to (2, 46).
    3. Walk North along the western edge (X=2) all the way to Y=12.
    4. Walk East to (14, 12) to reach the plateau area.
    5. Walk North to (14, 10) to reach the sighting spot.
- Fact: This is a 100% land-based route that ignores buoys, surfing, and repels. It is much longer but guaranteed to work without HMs.
- Preparation: Lead with XENON (Haunter).
- Start Turn: 47680 (Suicune North Beach Quest)

# Strategy Lessons
- Buoy Maze: The buoy spiral is the only intended path.
- Menu Memory: Items in the pack stay selected. Use the pocket-switch trick to reset cursor.
- Efficiency: Use (19, 30) for launching into the spiral.
