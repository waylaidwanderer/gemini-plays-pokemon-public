# Strategic Objectives
- **Primary:** Earn Rising Badge.
- **Secondary:** Pass Dragon User Challenge.
- **Immediate:** Cross the whirlpool to reach the Dragon Shrine.

# Key Mechanics & Lessons
- **Field Moves:** If 'A' interaction fails (even when facing correctly), ALWAYS fallback to Menu -> Pokemon -> [Mon] -> [Move].
- **Whirlpool:** Requires facing the whirlpool tile directly. 'A' button might be unreliable; Menu is safer.

- Status: Opening Menu to use Whirlpool (Manual).
- Reason: 'A' interaction failed to trigger text even when facing DOWN. Must use Party Menu.
- Step 1: Press 'Start' to open menu.
- Step 2: Select 'POKéMON'.
- Step 3: Select Lapis -> Whirlpool.
