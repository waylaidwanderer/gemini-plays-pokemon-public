# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard ground. Traversable.
- WALL: Impassable ground/object.
- WATER: Surf required. Traversable.
- BUOY: Impassable water obstacle.
- DOOR: Warp point. Traversable.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Ledge face. Blocks North movement.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way jump (North to South).
- BREAKABLE ROCK: Requires Rock Smash. Impassable.
- NPC: Impassable. Interact from adjacent tile.

# Strategy: Capture Suicune
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The West Beach Land Route (Verified)
- Plan:
  1. Walk to (12, 30) then down to (12, 32). [IN PROGRESS]
  2. Walk West through the corridor at Row 32/33 to reach the beach at X=2.
  3. Walk North along the X=2 corridor to Row 12.
  4. Walk East to (13, 12), then North to the plateau at (14, 10).
- Status: At (19, 30), beginning the land trek.
- Reasoning: This route is 100% land-based and bypasses all breakable rocks and the buoy maze. It uses the far west beach corridor (X=2) which is clear of ledges between Y=49 and Y=11.
