### Sprout Tower Layout
- The central pillar on 1F and 2F is a complete divider, preventing east-west travel.
- To cross between the east and west sides, one must use the 3rd floor.
- The main tower exit is on the eastern side of the 1st floor at (9, 15).

## IV. Untested Hypotheses & To-Do
- **Hypothesis:** Can Onix or Hoothoot learn Flash (HM05)?
- **To-Do:** Test teaching Flash as soon as I exit Sprout Tower.

## Sprout Tower Escape Plan
1. Ascend to Sprout Tower 3F via the ladder at (10, 14).
2. On 3F, cross from the west side to the east side by navigating around the central pillar. Target tile (8,9) to cross.
3. On the east side of 3F, find the ladder leading down to 2F. Explore the unseen areas if necessary.
4. On the east side of 2F, navigate to the ladder at (17, 3) to descend to 1F.
5. On 1F, navigate to the exit at (9, 15).
