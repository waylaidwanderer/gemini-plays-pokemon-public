# Strategy: Capture Suicune (Started Turn 48227)
- Goal: Reach (14, 10) to trigger sighting.
- Approach: The Northern Water Loop (Verified)
- Plan:
  1. Surf North to (22, 16). [IN PROGRESS]
  2. East to (23, 16), then North through Gap 6 at (23, 15) to (23, 14).
  3. West through Gap 4 at (19, 14) to (18, 14).
  4. North to Row 9, then West to (14, 9).
  5. South to (14, 10) and land.
- Status: At (22, 21) surfing, heading North.
- Reasoning: Row 15 is a continuous barrier of cliffs and buoys. The only way to the northern plateau is to loop through the gaps at X=23 and X=19 to reach the open water at Row 9.
