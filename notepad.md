# Kanto Campaign Status
- **Location:** Cerulean Pokemon Center.
- **Current Objective:** Reach the Power Plant via Route 9.
- **Immediate Task:** Attempt to Cut the tree at (33, 24) using the Menu to bypass potential context-button issues.
- **Observation:** Direct 'A' interaction failed. Testing Menu activation: Start -> Pokemon -> Belladonna -> Cut/Status. If "Cut" is valid, it will trigger. If not, "Status" will open (harmless).
- **Backup Plan:** If this fails, the tree is likely uncuttable. Will then investigate the house at (30, 23) as a potential path.

# Strategic Goals
1. **Restore Power:**
   - Investigate Power Plant (East of Cerulean, end of Route 9).
   - Fix the Generator (likely requires a part).
2. **Wake Snorlax:**
   - Requires Poke Flute functionality (Radio expansion card?).
   - Requires Power restored.
3. **Collect Kanto Badges:**
   - [x] Vermilion (Thunder)
