# Strategic Plan: Mt. Silver & Red
- **Strategy (The HOW):**
    1. Explore the upper areas of SilverCaveRoom1 (Row 11 and above) to find the ladder to the next floor.
    2. Face Red at the peak.

# Progress Tracking
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Acts as a wall on its North edge. Impassable when moving North (Up) FROM the tile, or South (Down) ONTO the tile. Verified: (8, 20)->(8, 19) [Up] BLOCKED, (10, 33)->(10, 34) [Down] BLOCKED.
- Navigation Analysis: The central area is divided by FLOOR_UP_WALL barriers. Side corridors (X=0, X=19) are likely the way forward.

# Area Records: Silver Cave Room 1 (3_74)

- Inventory: 19/20 slots used in Items pocket. 4/12 in Balls pocket.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: North edge is impassable. Cannot move North FROM it or South ONTO it.
