# Blackthorn Gym Layout & Boulders
- 2F Boulders:
  - Boulder 6: (3, 3)
  - Boulder 7: (6, 1)
  - Boulder 8: (8, 17)
- 2F Pits:
  - Pit (2, 5) -> 1F (2, 6)
  - Pit (8, 3) -> 1F (7, 6)
  - Pit (8, 7) -> 1F (7, 7) (Status: FILLED)
- Strategy:
  1. Boulder 8 (8, 17) seems most accessible from the entrance. Investigate its path to Pit (8, 3).
  2. Boulder 6 (3, 3) to Pit (2, 5).
  3. Boulder 7 (6, 1) to Pit (8, 3). (Wait, two boulders for one pit? No, check if there's another pit).
- 1F Path to Clair:
  - The "bridge" requires pits at (2, 6), (7, 6), and (7, 7) to be filled.
  - (7, 7) is filled.
  - Need to fill (2, 6) and (7, 6).
  - 2F Pits (2, 5) and (8, 3) correspond to these. (Turn 29374)

# Battle Lessons
