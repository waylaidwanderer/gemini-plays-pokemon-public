# Gem's Journey in Pokémon Crystal

## Current Strategy
- **Primary Goal:** Stop Team Rocket.
- **Secondary Goal:** Investigate Radio Tower (Team Rocket takeover).
- **Navigation:** Explore Goldenrod Game Corner.
- **Status:** In Goldenrod City (North). Talking to Rocket Grunt at (29, 7).
- **Plan:**
    1. Listen to Rocket Grunt at (29, 7).
    2. If no uniform, check Rocket Grunt at (31, 10).
    3. If neither has it, check the Radio Tower entrance area (Northwest).
    4. Re-evaluate if the Uniform is in the Underground (maybe I missed someone).

**Notes:**
- Radio Tower entrance was elusive.
- Rocket Grunt at (16, 23) blocks the street.
- Gentleman at (5, 10) bragged about buying Blizzard TM with coins.
- Underground Uniform quest unconfirmed.

## Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR:** Standard walkable tile.
- **WALL:** Impassable.
- **COUNTER:** Impassable, but interactable from adjacent tile if an NPC is behind it.
- **LADDER:** Warp tile to another map.

**Goldenrod City Notes:**
- Name Rater is at (15, 7).

## Reflections & Lessons
- **Fly Mechanic:** Must verify destination text before confirming. Do not batch navigation and confirmation.
- **Map Markers:** Distinguish PC types (Storage vs Research) to avoid confusion.
- **Menu Hygiene:** Ensure menus are fully closed to avoid state desync.
- **Navigation Lesson:** Always verify the path against specific tile data (Mental Map/ASCII) to identify obstacles like Headbutt Trees or Walls before defining a path plan. Straight lines are rarely safe.
- **Observation:** The Super Nerd at (6, 9) in the Underground appears to be already defeated (or friendly), as he didn't trigger a battle on sight. This suggests I might have cleared this area before or he's a non-hostile NPC.
- **Hypothesis Check:** If the "Uniform" quest isn't active, maybe I can just walk into the Radio Tower? But I couldn't reach the door. The Underground is the best lead for now.
- **Discovery:** Pokefan M at (2, 10) threw his **Coin Case** in the **Underground**. I should go find it.
