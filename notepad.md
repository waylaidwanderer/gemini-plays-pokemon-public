# I. Core Gameplay & World Rules
- **Poison Damage:** Poisoned Pokémon in the party lose 1 HP every four steps taken outside of battle.
- **Fainted Pokémon can use HMs:** Confirmed that a fainted Pokémon can be selected to use a field move like Strength.
- **Follower Pokémon Mechanics:** When moving onto a tile occupied by Pikachu, the player and Pikachu appear to swap positions. The first button press turns to face, the second moves.

# II. Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- `ground`: Walkable tile.
- `grass`: Tall grass where wild Pokémon appear. Walkable like `ground`.
- `elevated_ground`: Walkable ground at a higher elevation. Movement to/from `ground` tiles requires `steps` or a one-way `ledge` drop.
- `cleared_boulder_barrier`: A tile that becomes traversable after a boulder switch is activated. Acts like `elevated_ground` and can function as a one-way ramp up.
- `steps`: Connects `ground` and `elevated_ground` tiles, allowing vertical movement between them.
- `ledge`: Can only be traversed downwards from an adjacent tile above it.
- `water`: Crossable using HM Surf.
- `impassable`: Walls, rocks, and sometimes objects like defeated trainers. Cannot be entered.
- `ladder_down` / `ladder_up`: Warps between floors.
- `hole`: Warps the player (or a boulder) to the floor below.
- `boulder_switch`: Floor switch for boulders.
- `boulder_barrier`: Impassable barrier linked to a boulder switch.
- `warp`: A tile that transports the player to another location, often a door or cave entrance.

# III. Puzzle Mechanics & Solutions
- **Reset Condition:** Boulder puzzles reset upon leaving and re-entering a map or using ladders between floors.
- **Boulder/Item Interaction:** Pushing a boulder onto an item collects the item and moves the boulder into that space.
- **Strength Push Mechanics:** The push is executed from an adjacent tile, and only the boulder moves.

# IV. Battle Intelligence
## A. Type Effectiveness Chart (OBSERVATION-ONLY)
- **Super Effective (2x damage):**
  - Electric > Flying, Water
  - Water > Rock/Ground
  - Ground > Rock/Ground, Fire, Electric, Rock
  - Ice > Ground, Grass, Flying, Dragon
  - Flying > Fighting, Grass, Bug
  - Fighting > Normal, Rock, Ice
- **Not Very Effective (0.5x damage):**
  - Normal !> Rock/Ground, Rock
- **Immune (0x damage):**
  - Ground immune to Electric
  - Flying immune to Ground

## B. Strategic Notes & Mechanics
- **"No Will to Fight" Message:** A party menu cursor error on a fainted Pokémon, not a refusal to battle.
- **Struggle Mechanic:** Used automatically only when a Pokémon is out of PP for ALL moves.
- **Full Heal:** Cures status conditions only, does not restore HP.
- **Body Slam:** Can cause paralysis.

# V. Methodology & Lessons Learned
- **Hypothesis-Driven Approach:** I must form a single, testable hypothesis, document it, test it, and record the conclusion. This avoids chaotic, assumption-driven actions.
- **Tool Reliability & Immediate Action:** A tool that produces an incorrect or impossible result is a critical failure. I MUST fix it immediately with `define_tool` instead of deferring the task or attempting workarounds. This is a non-negotiable directive.
- **Trust System Over Tools:** If the system validation check insists a path is reachable while my tools (`pathfinder`, `landmass_analyzer`) say it is not, the system is correct and my tools are flawed. The immediate priority becomes debugging the tool, not continuing to test hypotheses based on the tool's flawed output.

# VI. Tool Development Status
- `pathfinder`: **BUGGED.** The tool is failing to find a path on Victory Road 1F that the system validation checks confirm exists. This indicates a critical flaw in its traversal logic for multi-level maps.
- `landmass_analyzer`: **SUSPECT.** This tool's logic is the basis for the pathfinder's, so it may also be flawed. Its conclusion that I am on a disconnected landmass is contradicted by the system.

# VII. Current Debugging Plan: `pathfinder`
- **Situation:** Trapped on the western landmass of Victory Road 1F. My tools report no path out, but system validation insists the exits are reachable.
- **Conclusion:** My `pathfinder`'s traversal logic is bugged.
- **Plan:**
  1. Run `pathfinder` with extensive verbose logging, targeting the confirmed-reachable ladder at (2, 2).
  2. Analyze the log to pinpoint the exact logical failure in the `get_neighbors` function.
  3. Rewrite the traversal logic to be more robust and correctly handle all known tile types and elevation changes.
  4. Re-verify the tool by pathfinding to the ladder again.
