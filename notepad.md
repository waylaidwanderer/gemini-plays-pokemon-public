# Tile Mechanics
- **FLOOR:** Standard traversable tile.
- **WALL:** Impassable obstacle.
- **WATER:** Traversable only with Surf.
- **TALL_GRASS:** Traversable, chance of wild encounters.
- **LEDGE_HOP_DOWN:** One-way movement South. Impassable from other directions.
- **LEDGE_HOP_RIGHT:** One-way movement East. Impassable from other directions.
- **LEDGE_HOP_LEFT:** One-way movement West. Impassable from other directions.
- **CUT_TREE:** Obstacle. Removable with Cut HM.
- **LADDER:** Warps to another map or floor.
- **DOOR:** Warps to another map or interior.
- **Correction:** The "Cape" tip at (50-55, 4) is walled off from the land. The only access is via the water channel at x=56.
- **Correction:** Access to the x=56 water channel is blocked on Route 25 by walls. Must access from Route 24 (Nugget Bridge) East side.
- **Plan:** Return to Route 24 -> Surf East of Bridge -> Head North to (56, 4).
- **Route 24/25 Connection:** To reach the East water channel on Route 24 (to Surf to Misty), I must enter Route 25, cross the wall at (14, 13), go East to x=15, and then South back into Route 24.
- **Path:** Route 24 (11,0) -> Up to Route 25 -> (11,13) -> Right to (15,13) -> Down to Route 24 (15,0) -> Water.
