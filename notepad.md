## Basement Puzzle Strategy
- **Goal:** Reach East side (Items/Ladder).
- **Hypothesis:** NPC 5's position or facing direction controls the boxes.
- **Observations:**
    - NPC 5 Facing UP = Boxes Closed (WALL).
    - NPC 5 Facing DOWN = Boxes Closed? (Need to verify).
    - "Work behind scenes where no one can see us".
- **Plan:**
    1. **Position:** Move to (8, 10).
    2. **Observe:** Watch the boxes at (6, 10)/(7, 10) and (10, 10)/(11, 10) as NPC 5 moves.
    3. **Test:** If boxes open, rush through.
    4. **Alternative:** If boxes never open, try to find a blind spot or manipulate NPC 6/7.

## Status
- Player at (8, 9).
- NPC 5 at (9, 11) (Moving).
- Action: Turning RIGHT to face (9, 9). Waiting for NPC to arrive.
