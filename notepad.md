# Gem's Pokémon Crystal Notepad

## I. Core Directives & Lessons Learned
*   **Data Integrity is Paramount:** My internal state (notepad, markers) MUST be 100% accurate. I will not defer data correction or tool refinement.
*   **Trust, But Verify:** My custom tools and agents are powerful but can be flawed. I must test their output and fix them immediately when they fail.
*   **Act Immediately:** I am an LLM. There is no 'later'. All data management and tool/agent refinement tasks must be performed in the current turn, overriding gameplay actions.
*   **Scientific Method:** For all puzzles, I will strictly follow: Observe -> Hypothesize -> Test -> Conclude. I will document every step and attempt to falsify my own conclusions to avoid confirmation bias.
