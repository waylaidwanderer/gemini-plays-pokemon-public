# Active Strategy: The Suicune Pursuit
- **Immediate Goal:** Trigger Suicune sighting at (14, 10) in northern Cianwood.
- **Battle Prep:** Lead with Lv64 Calcifer to sweep Eusine's team.
- **Plan (The X=2 Expressway):**
  1. Currently at (27, 45). Move West to (18, 45).
  2. Move South through gap at (18, 46) to (18, 49).
  3. Move East to (21, 49) and South through gap at (21, 50) to (21, 51).
  4. Move West on Row 51 to (2, 51).
  5. Move North via X=2 Expressway to (2, 10).
  6. Move East on Row 10 to (14, 10) for the sighting.
- **Verification:** Gaps at (18, 46) and (21, 50) confirmed FLOOR. X=2 corridor is clear of all barriers.

# Progress Tracking
- **Sighting Pursuit Start:** Turn #50620.
- **Failed Hypotheses:**
  1. Inner Maze Path (Blocked by Row 15 wall).
  2. Sea Bypass (Blocked by buoy wall).
  3. Southern Surf Loop (Unverified transition).
- **Key Discovery:** Cianwood land is partitioned by one-way cliffs. The X=2 Expressway via the southern gaps is the intended land route.

# Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR: Standard terrain.
- WALL / BUOY: Impassable.
- WATER: Surf only.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks North.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL (Terrace): Blocks South.
- ROCK: Cleared with Rock Smash.

# Area Notes: Cianwood City
- **Navigation:** X=2 is the only land corridor reaching Row 10 from the south. X=4 is blocked by a wall at (4, 23).
- **Dead Ends:** (11, 15) is a pocket blocked by cliffs.
