# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
## Strategy: The Western Bypass (X=2)
The northern plateau (14, 10) is accessible via the western coastal corridor (X=2).

### Execution Plan
1. Central Terrace: Navigate to (6, 24) via the gap at (9, 33). (In Progress)
2. West Coast Entry: Navigate to (2, 20) via the (5, 24) gap and (4, 20) UP_WALL.
3. Highway North: Walk North along X=2 to Row 14.
4. Final Approach: Walk East to (14, 14) and North to (14, 10).

## Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR: Land (Traversable).
- WALL, BUOY, DOOR: Impassable.
- WATER: Requires Surf.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way North. Blocks DOWN movement (e.g., Row 50; (6, 34); (4, 20); (4, 30)).
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: One-way South. Blocks NORTH movement (e.g., (10, 15)).

## Battle Plan: Eusine
- Roster: Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25).
- Counter: Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion) - Flamethrower sweep.
