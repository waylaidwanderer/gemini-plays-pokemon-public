# Game Mechanics & Systems
## Tile Mechanics (Verified)
- FLOOR / TALL_GRASS: Walkable.
- WALL / COUNTER / FLOOR_UP_WALL (from North): Impassable.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN (⤵️): One-way North to South. (Verified at Row 21, 23, 34).
- Blackthorn Elevation: Tiered city. Barriers at Row 21, 23, 28, 30, 32, 34.
- Northward Gaps:
  - Row 23: Column 0-2, 13.
  - Row 21: Column 0-4, 9, 19, 33.

# Exploration Log
- Items: Max Potion (7, 33), Mysteryberry (16, 82).
- Confirmed Path to Route 45 Strip 5 (x=16-17):
  (17, 33) -> (17, 31) -> (13, 31) -> (13, 25) -> (25, 25) -> (25, 29) -> (31, 29) -> (31, 33) -> (25, 33) -> (25, 35) -> (17, 35).

# Lessons Learned
- Blackthorn Maze: Southern walls at Row 32, 34 are hard barriers from the North. Resetting to high ground requires using specific gaps (e.g., col 13 at Row 23).
- Strip Isolation: Route 45 Strip 5 is isolated at Row 35. Must enter from Blackthorn x=15-18.
- Menu Verification: Always check the current screen before executing long button sequences.
