*   **Tertiary Goal:** Find and assist Bill on Route 25.

# Gameplay Notes & Strategy
## Navigation & Exploration
*   NPCs on `navigable: false` tiles are physical obstacles; their tile remains non-navigable.
*   Ledges: Upward movement onto a ledge from below is prevented, even if `navigable="true"`.
*   **Segmented Dungeons:** Complex dungeons (e.g., Mt. Moon) have isolated segments per floor, accessed via specific warps. Systematically explore warps.
*   **1x1 Warps:** Step off and back on if activation is tricky.
*   Trust game state `reachable: no` for warp/object accessibility.
*   **Item Pickup:** Items are picked up by facing them and pressing 'A' *when the screen is clear*, not by walking onto their tile.

## Battle Strategy
*   Precise battle menu navigation. Mind type matchups & PP. Internalize ROM hack type changes.
*   **Risk Assessment:** Avoid switching low HP Pokémon against KOs. Run if party critical (unless training overrides).
*   **Healing Priority:** Pokémon Center if key Pokémon critically injured & no immediate objective outweighs.
*   **Multi-Pokémon Trainers:** Confirm trainer is fully defeated (all Pokémon) before assuming victory and moving on.
*   **Map Markers:** Mark defeated trainers *immediately* after the battle concludes and dialogue is cleared.

## ROM Hack Specifics
*   **General:** Old Rod (Viridian Mart), HMs forgettable/menu use, TMs repurchasable, Trade evos by level.

  - Bug NVE vs Poison (CONFIRMED: Beedrill's Pin Missile (Bug) NVE vs ECHO (Poison/Flying) on Route 24).
  - Grass 0.25x vs Poison/Flying (Observed).
  - Poison NVE vs Poison (Observed: Acid vs Ekans, and likely applies to Zubat which is Poison/Flying).
*   **Stat Boosts:** Pikachu, Farfetch’d, Venomoth, Onix.
*   **Level Caps:** Brock (Onix Lv12 -> Cap 12), Misty (Starmie Lv21 -> Cap 21), Lt. Surge (Raichu Lv28 -> Player Cap 24).

# Game Mechanics & Discoveries

## Battle & EXP Mechanics
*   **EXP at Level Cap:** Pokémon at cap (e.g., BELLA Lv21) gain NO EXP, despite message. BELLA's EXP was 6458 before Psyduck and 6458 after Psyduck, confirming no gain from Psyduck or Starmie.
*   Prioritize healing if party critical (outside of strategic sacrifices).

## Type Matchup Discoveries
*   Poison-type moves are Not Very Effective (NVE) against opposing Poison-type Pokémon (observed: Acid vs Ekans).

# Agent Development & Usage
## Evolution Advisor Agent
*   Defined. Will be used for evolution decisions (e.g. Moon Stone on NINA/LUNA).
## General Agent Usage Notes
*   When an agent definition or call fails multiple times, abandon that specific agent or approach for the immediate future and attempt to solve the problem manually or with a different, simpler tool to maintain momentum.
*   The Gym Puzzle Solver Agent was deleted due to repeated failures and hitting the agent limit.

# Cerulean Gym Mechanics
*   **Final Conclusion:** All direct water crossings in the central pool are impossible. Path to trainers involves navigating the perimeter ground tiles only. Water tiles marked `navigable: false` are truly impassable. Reaching trainers on platforms requires navigating the outer ground walkways and then specific connecting ground tiles onto those platforms.

# Cerulean Gym Navigation Correction
*   The tile (6,5) directly south of the platform where I fought Misty (e.g. from (6,4)) is WATER and impassable.
*   **Corrected Exit Path from (6,4) facing Down:** Right (to 7,4), Right (to 8,4), Down (to 8,5), Down (to 8,6), Left (to 7,6), Left (to 6,6), then Down x8 (to 6,7 -> 6,8 -> 6,9 -> 6,10 -> 6,11 -> 6,12 -> 6,13 -> 6,14). Then Down again to use the warp at (6,14).

# Cerulean Melanies House Notes
*   Melanie (Girl, ID 1) at (4,2) - Non-battling. Dialogue: 'I take care of injured POKéMON. I nursed this BULBASAUR back to health. It needs a good trainer to take care of it now.'
*   Bulbasaur (ID 2) at (5,2) - Non-battling. Dialogue: 'Bubba! Zoar!'. Was not offered despite Melanie's dialogue, possibly due to full party and no PC prompt triggered.
*   This house does not appear to be a direct path to Vermilion City based on initial exploration.

- Oddish (ID 3) at (2,5) in Melanie's House: Dialogue 'ODDISH: Orddissh!' - Interacted.

- Sandshrew (ID 4) at (6,4) in Melanie's House: Dialogue 'SANDSHREW: Pikii!' - Interacted.

# Cerulean Bike Shop Notes
*   Bike Shop Clerk at (7,3) offers a BICYCLE for ¥1,000,000.

- Cerulean City: The tree at (20,29) (burgled house entrance) requires HM01 Cut.

- Badge House Man (Cerulean Badge House, (6,4)) - Non-battling. Offers badge descriptions.

# Archived Hypotheses & Learnings
## Cerulean City Bridge (Route 24 Exit) - Failed Hypotheses (Archived)
*   Moving North *from* each tile (9,8) through (19,8) does not trigger a map transition.
*   Moving North *onto* each tile (13,8) through (19,8) from their corresponding Y=9 tiles does not trigger a map transition.
*   Stepping *onto* each tile (10,8) through (19,8) by moving eastward along Y=8 does not trigger a map transition.
*   Stepping *onto* each tile (18,8) through (9,8) by moving westward along Y=8 does not trigger a map transition.
*   Moving North from (10,8) when already on the tile and facing North (two-step) does not trigger a map transition. (Tested Turn #9858)
*   Moving North from (11,8) when already on the tile and facing North (two-step) does not trigger a map transition. (Tested Turn #9861)

# Cerulean City Item/Trainer Bug (29,27) & (30,27)
- The Poké Ball item at (29,27) is unobtainable due to Cool Trainer F (ID 7) at (30,27) being in a persistent dialogue loop (e.g., 'ELECTRODE is loafing around...'). Abandoning this item for now. Will try again later if I pass by and remember.

# Exploration Agent Suggestions
* Exploration Prioritizer Agent (Turn 10172): Suggested exploring unseen tile cluster near (31,13) in Cerulean City (Priority 5).

# Tool Usage Discoveries
*   `manage_world_knowledge` `add_node`: Requires a self-generated unique string for the `id` field in the payload, contrary to initial assumption that it was auto-generated if omitted. Example: `{"id": "my_unique_node_id", ...}`.

## Battle Discoveries & Type Matchups (Ongoing)
*   **Poison vs. Bug/Flying (Butterfree):** BELLA's Acid (Poison) was super effective against a Lv13 Butterfree (Bug/Flying). This strongly suggests Poison-type moves are super effective against Bug-type Pokémon in this ROM hack. Needs further verification with pure Bug types and pure Flying types if possible. (Route 24, Turn 10206)
*   **Bug vs. Poison/Flying (Beedrill vs Echo):** Enemy BEEDRILL's Pin Missile (Bug-type) was 'not very effective' against ECHO (Poison/Flying, Lv12). This implies Bug is NVE vs. Poison, or NVE vs. Flying, or both. Given Bug is normally NVE vs. Flying, this reinforces the hypothesis that **Bug is NVE vs. Poison** in this ROM hack. (Route 24, Turn 10224)

- Nugget Bridge Bug Catcher 1 at (ROUTE_24 11,31) - Defeated. Pokémon: BUTTERFREE Lv13, BEEDRILL Lv13.

- Lass (Nugget Bridge Cool Trainer F) (ID 6) at (ROUTE_24 11,29) - Defeated. Pokémon: JIGGLYPUFF Lv15, ODDISH Lv15.

# Route 24 - Nugget Bridge Notes
*   Nugget Bridge is a trainer gauntlet (5 trainers to beat for a prize).
*   Party Health: ZAPPY (21/53 HP) and ECHO (14/34 HP) are low. Proceeding with caution and strategic switching.

# Trainer Battle Intel (Route 24)
- Youngster (ROUTE24_YOUNGSTER1) (ID 5) at (ROUTE_24 12,26) - Defeated.

*   **PIDGEY (Route 24 Lass vs ZAPPY Lv18):** Confirmed faster. Uses Sand-Attack repeatedly. (Observed Turn 10350+)

- Lass (ROUTE24_COOLTRAINER_F1) (ID 4) at (ROUTE_24 11,23) - Defeated. Pokémon: PIDGEY Lv16, NIDORAN♀ Lv16.

# Future Agent Ideas
*   (No outstanding unimplemented agent ideas currently)

# Lessons Learned from Critiques & Gameplay
- Resource Management: Protracted battles against single Pokémon (e.g., Pidgey on R24) can severely deplete party resources. Re-evaluate strategy if a battle drags on and consider retreating to heal sooner, especially in a gauntlet.
- Accuracy Debuffs (e.g., Sand-Attack): Stacked accuracy debuffs are extremely detrimental. Consider switching out debuffed Pokémon sooner, even if it means taking a hit on a fresh Pokémon. Moves with <100% base accuracy become highly unreliable.
- Critical Agent Evaluation: While agents provide valuable advice, critically evaluate their recommendations, especially if they rely on unconfirmed assumptions (e.g., speed tiers) or if following their advice repeatedly leads to unfavorable situations (e.g., due to persistent debuffs not fully accounted for by the agent's initial assessment).
- Pathing Near Warps: When pathing near sensitive warps, ensure the movement plan explicitly moves *past* the warp tile if not intending to use it, or detours significantly. Avoid landing on a warp tile if the next intended move is in the warp's activation direction.
- **Impassable Trainer Tiles:** Tiles occupied by defeated trainers that are marked `navigable: false` in the map XML are still impassable. The NPC's defeated status does not override the tile's inherent impassability. Always find a path around such tiles.

# Route 24 - Nugget Bridge Notes (Update)
* Nugget Bridge Challenge completed. Received Nugget as prize.

# Gameplay Notes & Strategy (Update)
## Financials
* Current Money: ¥8112 (as of Turn 10498)

# Agent Development & Usage (Updates)
*   Consider enhancing `exploration_prioritizer_agent` and `objective_validator_agent` to provide high-level pathing hints (e.g., 'approach from west', 'requires upper platform access') if a clear route is discernible, possibly using their `run_code` capability for deeper analysis.
*   `cerulean_pathfinder_agent` (Turn 10508): First use provided a flawed path, attempting to move into the Gym Sign obstacle at (28,22) in Cerulean City. Needs review/debugging if future paths also fail to consider basic obstacles. The agent's system prompt has been updated to explicitly state that `navigable="false"` tiles are impassable.

# Cerulean City Navigation Notes (Additions)
- Officer Jenny (CERULEANCITY_GUARD2) at (28,13) blocks westward movement along Y=13. Pathing must go around (e.g., via Y=14 walkway).

# Battle Discoveries & Type Matchups (Ongoing)
*   **Stun Spore vs. Mankey (Fighting):** BELLA's Stun Spore (Grass-type status) failed against a Lv18 Mankey (Fighting) on Route 24 (Cool Trainer M). Message: "It didn't affect Enemy MANKEY!". This could indicate an immunity for Mankey, a specific type interaction in this ROM hack, or a miss (though the message suggests more than a miss). (Route 24, Turn 10534)

# Nugget Bridge Notes (Completion & Rocket Encounter)
* All 5 trainers on Nugget Bridge (Route 24) defeated.
* Received NUGGET as a prize from Cool Trainer M (ID 1, ROUTE24_COOLTRAINER_M1) at (12,16).
* After receiving the NUGGET, the same NPC (Cool Trainer M, ID 1) revealed himself to be a Team Rocket member and attempted to recruit Gem. Dialogue sequence followed, culminating in a battle.
