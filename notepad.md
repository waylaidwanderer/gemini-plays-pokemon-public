# Suicune Hunt Stats
- Started: Turn 18348
- Current Status: Roaming Johto.
- Strategy: Mean Look with XENON (Lv21), Sleep, Ultra Balls.

# Suicune Battle Plan
- Lead: XENON (Lv21)
- Turn 1: MEAN LOOK (prevent fleeing)
- Turn 2+: HYPNOSIS (apply Sleep)
- Goal: Lower HP carefully and use ULTRA BALLS.
- Note: Suicune is Level 40. XENON is Level 21. Mean Look must hit before Suicune acts or it will flee.

# Suicune Hunt Strategy
- **Preparation**: Stock up on Super Repels (Ecruteak Mart) and lead with XENON (Lv21).
- **Tracking**: Use the Pokedex AREA map after every map transition. Suicune moves whenever you change maps.
- **Encounter Loop**: Move back and forth between Ecruteak City and Route 38. This triggers Suicune's movement.
- **Catching**: When Suicune is on your current route, use a Super Repel (if XENON is leading) and search the grass. In battle, use MEAN LOOK immediately to prevent fleeing, then HYPNOSIS.

# PC Storage (Box 1)
- RICOTTA (RATICATE 16), CINNABAR (GOLDEEN 21), VORTEX (POLIWAG 22), INTERCEPT (YANMA 12), ROCKY (ONIX 6), EGG (CLEFFA 5), XFDW (MEOWTH 16), FRITTATA (TOGEPI 5), SHUCKIE (SHUCKLE 15), Blarney (SUDOWOODO 20).

# Lessons Learned
- Cannot use FLY from inside buildings; must be outdoors.
- Roaming Pokemon (Suicune) relocate upon EVERY map transition.
- FLYING forces roaming Pokemon to a completely random location in Johto.
- Poké Mart inventories scale with Badge progress; Super Repels appear later.
- Interacting with clerks behind counters: Face the counter tile, not the NPC.
- City Navigation: Buildings create complex layouts; use pathfinding tools to find non-obvious routes.
