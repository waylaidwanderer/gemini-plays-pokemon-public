# I. Quest Log

- **Current Quest: The Mt. Moon Fossil**
    - **Objective:** Find a way past the Rocket Grunt at Mt. Moon B2F (30,12) or the Hiker at 1F (6,7).
    - **Status:** Active. Current focus is testing new hypotheses generated by the puzzle_solver_agent.
- **Stalled Quest: The Copycat's Gift**
    - **Objective:** Obtain a POKé DOLL and give it to COPYCAT.
    - **Status:** Stalled. All leads in Cerulean City have been exhausted. Suspect COPYCAT is not in a currently accessible area.

# II. Fossil Quest - Hypotheses Log

- **Active Hypotheses (Ranked by Agent):**
    1.  **Fainted Fossil:** The Grunt wants a revived fossil Pokémon that has fainted. (Untestable due to low encounter rate in current area).
    2.  **Moon Stone Evolution:** Evolving a Clefairy with a Moon Stone in front of the Grunt will trigger an event.
    3.  **Hiker Disguise:** The Hiker on 1F will move if a 'Hiker' Pokémon (like Geodude) is in the party lead.
    4.  **Poké Doll for Hiker:** The Hiker on 1F will accept the POKé DOLL.

- **Failed Hypotheses:**
    - The Silph Scope will reveal a ghost in Mt. Moon, or the Grunt himself is a ghost. (Result: Failed. Prof. Oak prevents the item's use.)
    - The Rocket Grunt on B2F will accept the POKé DOLL as the 'fossil'. (Result: Failed. Prof. Oak prevents the item's use.)
    - Giving the POKé DOLL to the Grunt will make the Hiker on 1F move. (Result: Dependent on failed hypothesis, invalidated.)
    - The Hiker will only move for an 'adult', a status temporarily gained by interacting with the 'Old Man' in Viridian City. (Result: Failed. Hiker's dialogue was unchanged.)

# IV. Game Mechanics & Tile Glossary

- **General Mechanics:**
    - **POKé DOLL Escape:** A POKé DOLL can be used to guarantee an escape from a wild Pokémon battle.
- **Observed Anomalies:**
    - **Battle Menu Anomaly:** The game appears to intentionally restrict move selection in certain wild battles to the first move slot.
    - **Party Menu 'SWITCH' Lock:** The game can prevent using the 'SWITCH' command in the party menu, observed after multiple failed escape attempts.
    - **Shop Menu Navigation Anomaly:** The Cerulean Mart shop menu does not follow a standard grid layout and requires 'B' to exit.
- **Area-Specific Mechanics:**
    - **Pewter Museum Trap Tile:** On Pewter Museum 2F, the tile at (3,5) is a trap that warps the player to an isolated room. Escape requires interacting with a follower Pikachu.
    - **Pokemon Tower 6F Healer Change:** The friendly Channeler at (13,11) is no longer a healer. Her dialogue has changed to 'I feel anemic and weak...'.
- **Tile Types:**
    - **elevated_ground:** Walkable ground at a different elevation. Direct movement between `ground` and `elevated_ground` is impossible without `steps`.
