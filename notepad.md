# Tile Mechanics
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: Blocks SOUTH movement. Passable from SOUTH to NORTH.
- LEDGE_HOP_DOWN: Blocks NORTH movement. Found at Row 15 (X=3-17).
- Vertical Walls: X=3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 17, 20.

# Suicune Quest (Cianwood)
## Strategy: Sea Route Bypass (Final)
Reach (14, 10) by surfing around the city via the eastern buoy gaps.
1. Use SUPER REPEL and Surf East to X=27 corridor.
2. Surf North along X=27 to Row 8 (Gap in Row 9 buoy wall at 27, 9).
3. Surf West along Row 8 to X=19 (Above the plateau).
4. Surf South to Row 11 and land at (16, 11).
5. Move North over ledge at (16, 10) to trigger Suicune at (14, 10).

# Progress Notes
- Blocked: All land routes (X=2, 4, 6, 10, 12) are blocked by SOUTH-blocking ledges (FLOOR_UP_WALL).
- Verified: (27, 9) is a gap in the buoy walls.
- Verified: (16, 11) is a landing point for the plateau.
- SUPER REPEL is active.
- Stagnation Check: Abandoning land-based routes; Sea Route is the final priority.
