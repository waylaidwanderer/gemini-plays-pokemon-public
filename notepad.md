# Persistence Knowledge
## Tile Mechanics (Global)
- FLOOR: Traversable. Standard walking surface.
- WALL: Impassable.
- LADDER: Floor change (e.g. 1F to B1F).
- WARP_CARPET_DOWN: Map transition.
- COUNTER: Face and press A to interact.
- WATER: Requires SURF.
- LEDGE: Semi-traversable (jump down).
- GRASS: Wild encounter zone.
- HOLE: Fall to floor below.

## Active Quest: Find Granddaughter
- Status: Investigating lower deck (B1F). Path at (30, 6) is clear after map reset.
- Strategy: Navigate to western side via (30, 5) and (29, 5). Target: Super Nerd at (26, 9).
- Goal: Find the "lazy bum" sailor and the missing girl.

## Kanto Strategy
- Goal: Collect 8 Kanto badges.
- Target 1: Lt. Surge (Vermilion City).
- MVP: GNEISS (Graveler) Lv 51. Ground-type immunity to Electric.
- Training: Level up ICARUS and Ouroboros.

## Lessons Learned
- XENON (Haunter) is immune to Normal moves.
- NPCs may block corridors until specific events/dialogue.
- NPCs often update positions after a map transition.
- Hypothesis: The "lazy" sailor at (30, 6) moved to (31, 6) after talking to him and re-entering the map.
- Test: Re-entered B1F from 1F.
- Conclusion: Confirmed. Sailor (ID 2) is at (31, 6), path at (30, 6) is clear.
