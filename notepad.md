# Strategy: Suicune Hunt (Crystal)
- Sequence: 1. Burned Tower (Done) -> 2. Cianwood (Done) -> 3. Route 42 Island (Current) -> 4. Route 38 -> 5. Route 14 -> 6. Tin Tower 1F.
- Quest Start: Turn 20970 (Dec 25, 5:00 PM)
- Sighting 3 (Route 42): 
    - Verified in Pokedex at Turn 21303 (Dec 25, 6:58 PM).
    - Status: Standing on (26, 14) at Turn 21318, sprite not visible.
    - Hypothesis: Specific trigger tile required on the island.
    - Plan: Walk on all island FLOOR tiles.
- Lessons Learned:
    - Pokedex Navigation: Alphabetical order check! S is before T. Scroll UP from Togepi to find Suicune.
    - Scripted vs Roaming: Suicune is scripted until Sighting 5. Pokedex "AREA" dot for Suicune is reliable during sightings.
    - Menu Stagnation: Avoid repeatedly checking menus for confirmed information. Trust agents and notepad.
