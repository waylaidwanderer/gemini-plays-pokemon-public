# Underground Warehouse Switch Puzzle

**Goal:** Open Gate 3 (16, 6) to find the Director.

**Confirmed Mechanics:**
- **Gate 1 (2, 6):** Opens with **Switch 3 ON** (State 0-0-1).
- **Gate 2 (10, 6):** Opens with **Switch 3 ON + Switch 1 ON** (State 1-0-1). Also opened with Seq 3->2->1 (State 1-1-1).
- **Gate 3 (16, 6):** **OPEN** with **Switch 1 ON** (State 1-0-0).
- **Gate 1 (2, 6):** CLOSED with All Switches ON (Seq 1->2->3). Visual Confirmation.
- **Gate 3 (16, 6):** OPEN with All Switches ON (Tool reported, likely stale).
- **Hypothesis:** Switch 2 ON or Switch 1 ON closes Gate 1. Gate 1 definitely opens with Switch 3 ON.
- **Plan:** Turn Switch 2 OFF. Check Gate 1.

**Current Status:**
- Switches: 1 ON, 2 ON, 3 ON.
- Position: Moving to Switch 2.

**Key Locations:**
- Switch 1: (16, 1) [Right]
- Switch 2: (10, 1) [Middle]
- Switch 3: (2, 1) [Left]
- Gate 2: (10, 6)
- Gate 3: (16, 6)
- **Gate 3 (16, 6):** Confirmed CLOSED with Seq 3->1->2 (State 1-1-1).
- **Gate 3 (16, 6):** Confirmed CLOSED with Seq 1->3->2 (State 1-1-1).
