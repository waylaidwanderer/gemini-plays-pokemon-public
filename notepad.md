# Current Objectives
*   **Primary Goal:** Obtain the Boulder Badge from the Pewter City Gym Leader, Brock.
*   **Secondary Goal:** Acquire sufficient funds (¬•) for Potions and train SPROUT (Oddish) to an effective level for the Gym battle.
*   **Tertiary Goal:** Systematically explore all 'Reachable Unseen Tiles' in Pewter City and investigate the 'Reachable Undiscovered Map Connection' to the East.

# Pewter City Strategy
*   **Immediate Priority (CRITICAL):** Systematically explore 'Reachable Unseen Tiles' (currently 14 listed, mostly in N/NW) using `exploration_planner_agent` to find trainers for money (current: ¬•156) and items. This is more achievable than repeated failed attempts to reach distant locations like the Pok√©mon Center across complex terrain.
*   **Financial Priority:** Defeat trainers for money to afford Potions (¬•200 each) and other supplies.
*   **Oddish Training for Brock:** SPROUT (ODDISH Lv7) needs significant training and ideally a Grass-type damaging move. The current level cap for 0 badges is 12. If Brock is faced, the cap becomes 14 (his Onix's level).
*   **Map Markers:** Consistently use map markers for defeated trainers (‚ò†Ô∏è), used warps (üö™), key locations (üìç), non-battling NPCs (‚ÑπÔ∏è), and confirmed dead ends (üö´).

# Pok√©mon Center Tasks (Next Visit)
*   **Heal Pok√©mon.**
*   **Agent Management (Priority):
    *   Use `pathing_script_analyzer_agent` on the A* script and `advanced_pathfinder_agent` logic to diagnose failures. Formally mark `advanced_pathfinder_agent` for deletion or major overhaul; cease current usage. Resolve status of `direct_pathing_agent`.
    *   **Low-Usage Agent Review (CRITICAL DECISIONS NEEDED):** Decisively re-evaluate `item_finder_agent`, `pokedex_completer_agent`, `team_builder_agent`, `leveling_training_advisor_agent`. Improve their prompts/utility for active use, or delete them to free up agent slots (currently at 10/10 limit).
    *   **Address 'New Agent Ideas':** Make decisions on defining (requires deletion of existing agent) or discarding 'Route Progress Analyzer Agent' and 'Risk Assessor Agent' ideas.
    *   Test `npc_interaction_planner_agent` further.
*   **Financial Planning:** Re-assess funds and purchase Potions if affordable.

# Current Pok√©mon Status
*   SPROUT (ODDISH): Lv7 (25/25 HP, EXP: 262). Moves: TACKLE, POISONPOWDER.
*   SPBARKY (PIKACHU): Lv12 (39/39 HP, EXP: 1728). **AT LEVEL CAP (12).** Moves: THUNDERSHOCK, TAIL WHIP, QUICK ATTACK, THUNDER WAVE.

# Inventory & Finances
*   POK√© BALL x2
*   Money: ¬•156

# Hard Mode Rules & ROM Hack Changes (Summary)
*   Battle Style: Set. No items in battle. Level caps apply (current 0 badges: 12. Brock's Ace Onix Lv14 -> cap before Brock: 14).
*   HMs: Forgettable, menu use, not PC storable. All 151 obtainable. Trade evos by level. Smarter AI. Tougher bosses. EXP. All early.

# Navigation Strategy & Best Practices (CRITICAL - MUST ADHERE)
*   **Meticulous Tile-by-Tile Verification (ABSOLUTE PRIORITY):** Before *any* movement segment, consult map memory (XML) and verify `navigable="true"` and `type` of *every single tile*. XML is sole truth for player movement.
*   **Extremely Short, Verifiable Segments:** Path segments MUST be 3-5 tiles max, or single clear small areas. Each chunk 100% confirmed navigable from XML *before* execution.
*   **Use `move_validator_agent` (CRITICAL):** Before executing *any* planned path segment longer than a single step, use `move_validator_agent` to confirm path validity against the map XML. This is essential to prevent wasted turns.
*   **Focus on Continuous Open Corridors:** Prioritize verified open corridors based on XML, not distant coordinates across unverified terrain.
*   **Map Marker Usage (IMMEDIATE & ABSOLUTE):** *Immediately* mark confirmed dead ends (üö´), key navigational turns/points (üìç), and important warps (üö™) after discovery/use. Essential for spatial understanding.
*   **Pikachu Interaction:** If a direct path avoiding Pikachu's tile can be identified, it's more efficient than stepping onto his tile and immediately changing direction.
*   **`navigable="false"` is Absolute:** If XML shows `navigable="false"`, it is IMPASSABLE by player, regardless of tile type or NPC status. Trust `navigable` attribute.
*   **Agent Utilization for Exploration:** Use `exploration_planner_agent` to generate paths for 'Reachable Unseen Tiles'.

# Recent Events & Observations (Last ~50 turns)
*   **Pewter City Arrival & Gym Guide:** Reached Pewter City. Youngster NPC at (36,17) led me to the Gym entrance at (12,19). He is not a battlable trainer. Marked Gym entrance (üèõÔ∏è) and Youngster (üíÅ).
*   **Navigation Issues:** Multiple failed attempts to navigate Pewter City, particularly towards the Pok√©mon Center, due to blocked paths and not strictly adhering to short, verified segments or using `move_validator_agent`.
*   **Cool Trainer F Interaction:** Cool Trainer F at (9,16) is not a trainer; provided info about Mt. Moon. Marked as (‚ÑπÔ∏è).
*   **Current Location:** (15,21) in Pewter City, facing Down. Pikachu at (15,20).

# Archived Learnings & Notes (Condensed)
*   Older battle logs, detailed early game event triggers, specific NPC dialogue not immediately relevant, detailed A* script failure logs (to be addressed by `pathing_script_analyzer_agent`). Repel Mechanics: Lead Pok√©mon level must be *strictly greater* than wild Pok√©mon level for Repel to be effective. `exploration_planner` Misuse: Agent is strictly for 'Reachable Unseen Tiles', not for paths to known, seen tiles. System Warnings: Avoid mixing directional and action buttons.

# Post-Critique Learnings & Adjustments (Turn 3800)
*   **`move_validator_agent` Usage (CRITICAL - NON-NEGOTIABLE):** MUST use `move_validator_agent` for *every single* multi-step path planned. No exceptions. This is to prevent further wasted turns from hitting impassable tiles, signs, or ledges incorrectly.
*   **`exploration_planner_agent` Contingency:** If `exploration_planner_agent` returns an empty path when reachable unseen tiles exist (as in Turn 3777), I must manually plan the exploration of those tiles using short, validated segments.
*   **Financial Priority (Reiteration):** Finding and defeating trainers for money (current: ¬•156) remains a top priority for Potions and supplies.
*   **Agent Management (Pok√©mon Center):** The plan to review, improve, or delete underused agents (`item_finder_agent`, `pokedex_completer_agent`, `team_builder_agent`, `leveling_training_advisor_agent`), resolve `direct_pathing_agent` status, and address 'New Agent Ideas' at the next Pok√©mon Center visit is still active and crucial.
*   **Map Knowledge Update:** `move_validator_agent` confirmed tile (32,13) in Pewter City is impassable (Turn 3800). This blocks direct southward travel from (32,3) beyond (32,12).

# Reflection & Strategy Update (Turn 3815)

## Navigation Learnings & Corrections
*   `move_validator_agent` previously indicated that path to (27,25) failed because tile (27,24) is **impassable**. This blocks direct southward approach to Super Nerd at (27,26) from (27,23). Will mark (27,24) as üö´.
*   Previously noted: (32,13) is impassable. Will mark as üö´.
*   **CRITICAL REITERATION:** Must use `move_validator_agent` for ALL multi-step paths. No exceptions. Break paths into short, verifiable segments.

## Financial & Training Status
*   Current Funds: ¬•156. Potions cost ¬•200. Critically low on money.
*   Finding and defeating trainers remains HIGHEST immediate priority.
*   SPROUT (Oddish Lv7) still needs significant training for Brock.

## Pewter City NPC Updates
*   Super Nerd at (28,18) is non-battling (provided Museum info). Marked ‚ÑπÔ∏è.

## Agent Management Notes
*   `exploration_planner_agent` failure on Turn 3777 (empty path with existing unseen tiles) needs prompt review/improvement at next PC visit.
*   **New Agent Ideas (for future definition if slots allow & utility confirmed):**
    *   **`route_progress_analyzer_agent`**: Analyzes map completion (trainers, items, warps).
        *   Input: `map_name`, `map_id`.
        *   Output: `completion_percentage`, `summary_of_missing_elements`.
    *   **`risk_assessor_agent`**: Assesses risk for party against challenges/areas.
        *   Input: `player_party_status`, `challenge_details`.
        *   Output: `risk_level`, `mitigation_suggestions`.
*   Tasks for next Pok√©mon Center visit remain: Review low-usage agents (`item_finder_agent`, `pokedex_completer_agent`, `team_builder_agent`, `leveling_training_advisor_agent`), consider defining new ones if slots are available.

## Current Tactical Plan (One action per turn)
1.  **Turn 3820:** Updated tactical plan in notepad. (DONE)
2.  **Turn 3821:** Attempted to delete `advanced_pathfinder_agent`. (FAILED - Agent not found)
3.  **Turn 3822:** Attempted to delete `direct_pathing_agent`. (FAILED - Agent not found)
4.  **This Turn (3823):** Update tactical plan in notepad with failed deletions.
5.  **Next Turn (3824):** Mark impassable tile (32,13) in Pewter City with üö´. (Tile (27,24) is already marked).
6.  **Subsequent Turns:** Path to an interaction spot for Super Nerd at (27,26) (e.g., (26,26) facing Right, (28,26) facing Left, (27,25) facing Down, or (27,27) facing Up). Goal: battle for money.

## Pathing Failures & Strategy Shift (Turn 3831)
*   `move_validator_agent` confirmed path to (27,25) to interact with Super Nerd at (27,26) failed due to tile (31,25) being impassable. Marked (31,25) as üö´.
*   Given repeated failures to find a path to the Super Nerd at (27,26) and no other apparent trainers in Pewter City, shifting strategy to explore the eastern 'Reachable Undiscovered Map Connection' from (40,18), (40,19), (40,17), or (40,20). This supports the secondary goal of acquiring funds.

## Path Execution Learning (Turn 3837)
*   **Full Sequence Execution:** When a multi-step path is validated (e.g., by `move_validator_agent`), I *must* provide the *entire* sequence of button presses in the `buttons_to_press` array for that turn. Providing only a partial sequence led to being blocked, as the game likely attempted an unintended continuation based on the last input direction after the provided sequence ended. My current position is (35,17) after executing only the first 8 of 16 validated presses. The Youngster at (36,17) blocked an implicit 'Right' continuation. Resuming path to (40,18).

## Pewter City NPC Event (Turn 3841)
*   Youngster (ID 5), previously Gym Guide at (36,17), initiated dialogue at (38,19) saying "BROCK's looking for new challengers! Follow me!".
*   Forced movement: Player moved from (38,19) to (30,19).
*   Youngster (ID 5) is now located at (28,18) facing Right.
*   Game state also lists Super Nerd (ID 3, non-battling) at (28,18). Focusing on Youngster as the active event.
*   Tile (28,18) is marked `navigable="false"` in map XML. Will interact from an adjacent tile.

## Pewter City Gym Escort Event (Turn 3841-3843)
*   Youngster (ID 5), previously Gym Guide, after dialogue at (38,19) saying "BROCK's looking for new challengers! Follow me!", forced player movement from (38,19) to (30,19).
*   Youngster (ID 5) then moved player from (30,19) to (12,19) in front of the Pewter Gym.
*   Youngster (ID 5) finished dialogue with "If you have the right stuff, go take on BROCK!".
*   Youngster (ID 5) is now located at (18,19) facing Right (as per game state on Turn 3843).
*   This event effectively guided the player to the Gym but did not involve a battle.
