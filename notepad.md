# Suicune Quest: Cianwood City
- **Start Turn:** 49885
- **Current Status:** Executing the "Great Southern Loop" (Row 51) to reach the Western Highway.

## Active Strategy: The Great Southern Loop
The northern plateau (14, 10) is accessible via the western coastal highway (X=2). Central land routes are blocked by elevation traps. This route utilizes the southern clearway at Row 51.

### Execution Plan
1. Reach Southern Clearway: Walk to (12, 28), Surf to (20, 32), and land. (In Progress)
2. Southern Crossing: Walk south to (20, 51), then west along Row 51 to (2, 51).
3. Coastal Ascent: Walk north along X=2 to Row 14.
4. Final Approach: Walk East to (8, 14), then North to Row 12 at (8, 12).
5. Trigger: Walk East to (14, 12) and North to Suicune at (14, 10).

## Verified Mechanics
- X=2 Highway: Clear land path from Row 51 to Row 14.
- Row 51: A completely clear land bridge across the island (X=2 to X=24).
- (20, 50): FLOOR. Valid gap in the southern ledge system.

## Battle Plan: Eusine
- Expected Team: Drowzee (Lv23), Haunter (Lv23), Electrode (Lv25).
- Lead: Calcifer (Lv64 Typhlosion).
- Strategy: Flamethrower sweep.

## Failed Hypotheses
- Hypothesis 1: Land access via X=11 (blocked by Row 30 wall).
- Hypothesis 2: Land access via X=6 (blocked by Row 34 elevation trap).
- Hypothesis 3: Cut tree at (11, 13) (fake tree).

## Map Marker Updates
- Restored marker for ROCK at (5, 29).
- Verified ROCKs at (4, 19), (4, 25), (10, 27).
