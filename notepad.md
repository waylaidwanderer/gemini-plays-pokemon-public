# Suicune Capture Strategy
- Lead: XENON (Haunter, Lv44).
- Move 1: Hypnosis (Sleep). Accuracy is key.
- Move 2: Night Shade (44 dmg). Suicune (Lv40) has ~120 HP. Use twice for Red health.
- Move 3: Dream Eater (100 power). Only works if Suicune is asleep.
- Item: Ultra Balls (32).
- Backup: GORP (Snorlax) as a tank. Calcifer (Typhlosion) is risky due to type disadvantage.

# Strategic Plan: Beach Express (West Coast)
- Step 1: Surf West from (15, 27) to (11, 27) and land.
- Step 2: Walk North along the X=2 corridor. This path avoids the elevated city center.
- Step 3: At Row 12, turn East and walk across the North Plateau.
- Step 4: Reach (14, 10) to trigger Suicune sighting.
- Status: XENON leading, Ultra Balls ready.
