- WATER: Traversable with HM03 SURF.
- TALL_GRASS / LONG_GRASS: Traversable; triggers wild encounters.
- LEDGE: One-way traversable (usually South).
- WARP / DOOR / WARP_CARPET / CAVE: Map transition.
- FRUIT_TREE: Impassable; interact for fruit/apricorn.
- HEADBUTT_TREE: Impassable; interact with HM02 HEADBUTT.
- CUT_TREE: Impassable until cleared with HM01 CUT.
- FLOOR_UP_WALL: One-way wall; jumpable from North to South.

# PC Storage (Box 1)
- CINNABAR (Goldeen 21), RICOTTA (Raticate 16), VORTEX (Poliwag 22), INTERCEPT (Yanma 12), ROCKY (Onix 6), EGG (CleFFA 5), XFDW (Meowth 16), FRITTATA (Togepi 5), SHUCKIE (Shuckle 15), Blarney (Sudowoodo 20).

# Battle Mechanics & Type Effectiveness
- Normal-type Pokémon (e.g. RATICATE) are immune to Ghost-type moves (e.g. LICK, NIGHT SHADE).
- To catch roaming Pokemon: Lead with Mean Look (XENON) to prevent fleeing. Use Hypnosis to sleep. Lower HP without fainting.

# General Lessons
- Surfing: Moving from a WATER tile onto a FLOOR tile automatically stops SURF.
- Roaming Logic: Map transitions (walking or flying) can cause roaming Pokemon to change routes. Check Pokedex frequently.
