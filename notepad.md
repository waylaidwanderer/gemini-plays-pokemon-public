# Mt. Moon Navigation Notes

## Current Strategy
- **Objective:** Fully explore the western maze area of Mt. Moon 1F.
- **Hypothesis (Attempt 1):** The entrance to this maze is the corridor leading west from (13, 23). The Youngster at (13, 17) is not blocking the entrance as previously thought; he must be reached from the other side of the central rock formation. The path forward is likely through this maze.

# Battle Learnings

- **Type Matchups:**
  - Electric is NOT very effective vs. Bug/Grass (Paras).
  - Electric is NOT very effective vs. Grass/Poison (Oddish, Bellsprout).
- **Risk Management:** Do not switch in low-level, non-resistant Pok√©mon to weaken wild encounters. It's too risky.

# Agent Reliability

- **`master_pathfinder_agent`:** This agent is **UNRELIABLE** in Mt. Moon. It has failed multiple times by routing through impassable walls and up ledges. Do not use for long-distance navigation on this map.

# Dungeon Mechanics Update
- **Defeated Trainers:** The defeated Rocket Grunt on Mt. Moon B2F at (16, 23) *is* an impassable obstacle, similar to trainers on Route 3.
