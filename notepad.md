- Start Turn: 45281 (Timestamp: Tuesday, Jan 13, 2026).
- Completed Cycles: 84.
- Repel 6: Application failed Turn 45882. Need to re-apply. Inventory: 58.

- Resource: 58 Super Repels remaining.
- Strategy Note: Statistically, roamers appear within 50-100 cycles. Continuing until encounter or ~100 cycles.
- Trapper Strategy:
  - Xenon (Haunter, Lv 44) missed Mean Look (learned at Lv 1 as Haunter, Lv 13 as Gastly).
  - Option: Train Spinarak (AAAAAAAAAA, Lv 13) in PC; it has Spider Web.
  - Decision: Use Master Ball for the first encounter.

- Bookkeeping: Use turn history for cycle counts to avoid "time-slipping". Verified Turn 45874.
