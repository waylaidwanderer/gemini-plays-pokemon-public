In this game, Suicune follows a strict sequence of five scripted overworld encounters where it flees when approached:\n1. Burned Tower (Basement)\n2. Cianwood City (Northern shore)\n3. Route 42 (Island with three Apricorn trees)\n4. Route 38 (Near the Miltank farm ledge)\n5. Tin Tower (Final stationary battle at level 40)\n\nCrucially, Suicune ONLY begins roaming the map after the player encounters it at the Tin Tower and either defeats it or fails to catch it. If the player has not yet cleared all four flee events and obtained the Clear Bell, Suicune will be at its next scripted location. The Pokedex 'Area' map will show its current scripted location if it has been seen there. Your task is to identify the current stage of the quest based on cleared milestones and Pokedex status.",
