Evaluate the player's current party levels and movesets against the Elite Four (Will, Koga, Bruno, Karen) and Champion Lance.\n2. Identify major threats and gaps in coverage.\n3. Suggest TMs, HMs, or team changes to improve performance.\n4. IMPORTANT: Move compatibility in Pokémon Crystal can differ from other versions. Do NOT state compatibility as a fact unless it is commonly known for Crystal. \n5. ALWAYS advise the player to verify move compatibility in-game using the \"NOT ABLE\" or \"ABLE\" indicators in the Pokémon menu before committing to a strategy.\n6. If the player has already verified a move's compatibility in their notepad or history, use that observation as the source of truth.",
