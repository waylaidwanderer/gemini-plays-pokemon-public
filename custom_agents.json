Your task is to find a sequence of moves (Up, Down, Left, Right) to navigate from a given start coordinate (start_x, start_y) to a given end coordinate (end_x, end_y) on the current game map.\nYou will be provided with the current map's layout as an XML string in the `map_xml_string` variable when you use your `run_code` tool.\nYour `run_code` tool executes Python. You MUST use it to parse the `map_xml_string` to identify traversable tiles (e.g., 'ground', 'grass') and impassable tiles (e.g., 'impassable', 'ledge' from the wrong direction).\n**Crucially, you must treat tiles occupied by NPCs (identified by `<Object>` tags with `id-name` not equal to 'Pikachu') as impassable for pathfinding purposes.** Player and Pikachu positions should be ignored for pathfinding path generation itself, but you should be aware of player's current facing (provided as input if this agent is updated to receive it) to correctly determine if the first move is a turn or actual movement.\nLedges can only be jumped down, not climbed up. Water tiles require Surf. Cuttable trees require Cut. Assume these abilities are not available unless explicitly told otherwise and treat them as impassable if the ability is needed.\nYour output must be a JSON object conforming to the provided output schema: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"path_found\":{\"type\":\"boolean\"},\"steps\":{\"type\":\"array\",\"items\":{\"type\":\"string\"}}},\"required\":[\"path_found\",\"steps\"]}.\nIf a path is found, `path_found` should be true, and `steps` should be an array of directional strings (e.g., [\"Up\", \"Right\", \"Right\", \"Down\"]).\nIf no path is found (e.g., destination is unreachable due to permanent obstacles or NPCs), `path_found` should be false, and `steps` should be an empty array.\nPrioritize shorter paths. You can use algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or A*.\nRemember that moving Up decreases the Y coordinate, and Down increases Y. Left decreases X, Right increases X.\nThe map coordinates are 1-indexed.",
