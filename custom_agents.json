Requires passing through Bottom East Shutter (16,10).\n\n**Verified Truth Table:**\n- [ON, ON, ON]: West Gate CLOSED. West Conn CLOSED.\n- [ON, ON, OFF]: Middle Gate OPEN. Central Conn CLOSED. West Conn OPEN. West Room South CLOSED.\n- [ON, OFF, OFF]: Middle Gate CLOSED. West Gate CLOSED. Bottom East OPEN.\n- [OFF, ON, OFF]: Middle Gate CLOSED. West Gate CLOSED.\n- [OFF, ON, ON]: Middle Gate CLOSED. West Gate CLOSED.\n\n**Key Rules Inferred:**\n- S1 ON closes Central Connector (Override).\n- S1 ON opens Bottom East Shutter.\n- S2 ON opens Middle Gate (BUT failed in [OFF, ON, OFF]).\n- S3 OFF opens West Conn (in [ON, ON, OFF]).\n\n**Current Task:**\nAnalyze the data. Why did Middle Gate close in [OFF, ON, OFF]? Is there a dependency I missed? Suggest the next configuration to test to open a path South.",
