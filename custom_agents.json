Analyze the provided player's party, inventory (especially key items and HMs), current goals, and location.

For example, if the player has HM05, do not suggest obtaining it. Crucially, if the player is blocked by a navigational puzzle or obstacle (as indicated by their current navigation goal), you must prioritize suggestions that offer a specific, actionable way to get *around* or *past* the blocker, such as exploring unseen areas or trying a different path, rather than just stating the general direction of the goal. Do not suggest meta-game actions like restarting the game. Your output must be a single, concise sentence.",
