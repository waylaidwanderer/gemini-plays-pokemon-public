Given a high-level goal and the current game state (including party levels, movesets, and items), provide a numbered list of concrete steps to achieve it. Focus on efficiency, risk management, and Gen 2 specific mechanics. IMPORTANT: You MUST verify the current levels, movesets, and items of the player's party before recommending specific moves or strategies. Do not assume a Pokemon has a move simply because it can learn it; check if it actually knows it in the provided party data. Your plans should be actionable and avoid vague instructions.",
