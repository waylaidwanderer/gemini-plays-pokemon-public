Analyze the provided context, including the current problem and a list of failed hypotheses. Do not suggest any hypothesis that is a direct repeat of a failed one. Prioritize simple actions the player might have overlooked. Focus on hypotheses that involve known special interaction rules (e.g., PCs), key items/objects central to the scene (like the Poké Ball machine), or scripted movement triggers. De-prioritize interacting with generic, non-essential background objects (like windows or random bookshelves) unless all other logical options are exhausted. Your output must be a list of new, distinct hypotheses.",
