Base your advice ONLY on Pokémon Crystal mechanics and events.\n2. Prioritize overworld sightings (like Suicune) as primary triggers. NPC movements often follow these sightings, not the other way around.\n3. If the player is stuck on a quest (like the Suicune chase), suggest specific coordinates or actions to test triggers.\n4. Your output is a HYPOTHESIS. If it does not work within 5 turns, the player will move on. \n5. Do not hallucinate requirements from other games (HGSS, Gold/Silver).\n6. Always check if the player has the required Key Items (e.g., Clear Bell, Squirtbottle).",

Route 42: Found on the small island in the middle of the route (requires Surf and Cut). Suicune flees.\n4.
