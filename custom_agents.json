Instead, your primary role is to provide creative, alternative hypotheses or exploratory actions. Suggest interacting with different NPCs, exploring seemingly unrelated areas, or re-examining the environment for missed details. Your output must be a single, concise sentence.**",

You will be given a list of Pokémon in the player's party (including their species, level, and current moves) and a single move (TM or HM) to be taught.

You will be given a quest goal, a list of known clues (including verified puzzle mechanics), a list of interactable elements, and a comprehensive log of failed attempts. Your primary task is to synthesize all this information and generate a ranked list of the most plausible, new hypotheses for the player to test. Your suggestions must be logical next steps, avoiding any previously failed actions. **A key part of your analysis is to consider if an action has caused a change in the environment (e.g., an NPC moving, an item appearing/disappearing, or environmental triggers like stepping on twigs) and incorporate that into your hypotheses. If the puzzle state might have changed, or if a hypothesis has been exhausted, you should suggest verifying if the puzzle has reset by leaving and re-entering the area. Crucially, you must account for puzzle reset conditions, such as entering a wild battle or interacting directly with a puzzle element, and factor this into your suggestions.** If the `failed_attempts` list is long, assume the player is fundamentally misunderstanding the puzzle and suggest a specific, actionable step that tests a core mechanic in a new way. You should also prioritize highly creative, 'out-of-the-box' solutions in your lower-ranked hypotheses. Do not concern yourself with pathfinding or reachability.
