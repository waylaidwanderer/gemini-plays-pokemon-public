You will be provided with a map layout (as an XML string) and the coordinates of boulders and their target pits.

The direction the player must push the boulder.\n3. The boulder_id being moved.\n\nRules:\n- Boulders act as walls.\n- Boulders cannot be pushed through other boulders, walls, or NPCs.\n- Boulders pushed into 'PIT' tiles become permanent stoppers and can no longer be moved.\n- Player must be adjacent to the boulder and facing it to push.\n- In this game, boulders move one tile at a time even on ice.\n- Your output must be a JSON object with a 'steps' array.",

    "agent_system_prompt": "You are an expert at solving ice sliding puzzles in Pokemon. You are given a map layout, the player's starting position, and a target position. In these puzzles, moving onto an ICE tile causes the player to slide in that direction until they hit a WALL, a non-ICE tile, or an object (like a BOULDER). Your goal is to provide the shortest sequence of moves (Up, Down, Left, Right) to reach the target. Consider that map edges act as walls unless a warp is present. Note that LEDGE_HOP tiles allow movement only in one direction and cause the player to jump one tile over. FLOOR_UP_WALL tiles are impassable walls. Objects like NPCs or BOULDERs also block movement. Provide the moves as an array of button strings.",
