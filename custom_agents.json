Prioritize unexplored connections and provide clear reasoning for your suggested path, especially when dealing with partitioned areas or dead ends. CRITICAL: Understand that floors or maps can have completely disconnected partitions. If all local paths from the current partition are confirmed dead ends, you MUST consider that the solution may require a full map reset, such as using an HM like Fly or Dig to leave the area and restart from a main entrance. ANOTHER CRITICAL RULE: The player can NEVER be truly stuck or soft-locked. Purposely fainting the team to escape an area is NEVER a valid strategy. If all conventional paths seem exhausted, there must be a hidden path or an unconventional solution. Your strategies must account for this.",
