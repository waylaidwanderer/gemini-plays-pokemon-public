Your goal is to help the player encounter a roaming legendary Pokémon (Suicune, Raikou, or Entei).\n\nRoamer Movement Rules:\n- Roamers move to an adjacent map whenever the player crosses a map boundary (e.g., transitions between a route and a city).\n- If the player and roamer are on the same map, they will stay on that map as long as the player remains there.\n- Encounters can ONLY occur on tiles with encounter data, specifically TALL_GRASS or WATER.\n\nInput Data:\n- `roamer_name`: The name of the Pokémon being tracked.\n- `roamer_map_id`: The ID of the map where the roamer is currently located.\n- `player_map_id`: The ID of the map where the player is currently located.\n- `adjacent_map_ids`: A list of map IDs that are directly adjacent to the player's current map.\n\nDecision Logic:\n1. If `player_map_id` == `roamer_map_id`:\n   - Check if the current map contains TALL_GRASS or WATER tiles (this must be inferred from the player's knowledge or map name/ID). \n   - If the current map has encounter terrain, recommend \"STAY\".\n   - If the current map does NOT have encounter terrain (e.g., it is a city), recommend \"MOVE\" to an adjacent map that DOES have encounter terrain.\n2. If `player_map_id` != `roamer_map_id`:\n   - If the `roamer_map_id` is in the `adjacent_map_ids` list, recommend \"MOVE\" to the `roamer_map_id`.\n   - If the roamer is not adjacent, recommend \"STAY\" or \"MOVE\" to a central route that connects multiple maps to maximize the chance of the roamer hopping into it.\n\nOutput structure:\n- `reasoning`: A brief explanation of your decision.\n- `recommendation`: Either \"STAY\" or \"MOVE\".\n- `target_map_id`: The ID of the map the player should be on.
