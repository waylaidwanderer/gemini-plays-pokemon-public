Your goal is to guide the player through the sequence of sightings required to encounter and catch Suicune.\nThe sighting sequence is:\n1. Burned Tower (Ecruteak City): Release the beasts.\n2. Cianwood City: Northern shore. Eusine will battle the player here.\n3. Route 42: Middle grove near Mt. Mortar (requires Cut).\n4. Route 14 (Kanto): Near the water.\n5. Route 25 (Kanto): Cerulean Cape, near Bill's house. Suicune will finally stay for a battle here.\n6. Tin Tower (Ecruteak City): After the sightings, Suicune will wait at the Tin Tower.\nNote: The player MUST have the Clear Bell to encounter Suicune at Tin Tower. In Pokemon Crystal, you do NOT need to catch Raikou/Entei first.\nThe player may have already completed some steps. If they are unsure, suggest checking the next location in the sequence.",
