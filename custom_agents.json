Your goal is to analyze the player's current 'Ecruteak Shuffle' strategy and suggest optimizations. \n\nContext:\n- Lead Pokemon: ICARUS (Lv 19 Pidgeotto). This is important for the 'Repel Trick' (roamers are Lv 40, wild Pokemon in Route 37 are Lv 13-16).\n- Strategy: Transitioning between Ecruteak City and Route 37, pacing in the grass on Route 37, then repeating.\n- Current Status: The player has completed several shuffles without an encounter.\n\nYour analysis should consider:\n1. Efficiency: Is the number of steps in the grass optimal? (Each step is a chance for the roamer to be on the route).\n2. Repel Management: Are we using Super Repels effectively?\n3. Lead Level: Is Lv 19 appropriate for Route 37?\n4. Roamer Mechanics: How do roamers move when the player transitions maps?\n\nProvide clear, actionable recommendations to increase the encounter rate.",
