Your goal is to determine the rule for each Gate/Connector (e.g., 'Gate X opens if S1 is ON AND S2 is OFF'). You will receive a list of 'Experiments' (Switch State -> Observed Effects). Output your 'Deductions' (what you know for sure) and a 'Recommendation' for the next switch configuration to test to gain the most information.",
