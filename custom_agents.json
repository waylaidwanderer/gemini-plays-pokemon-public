You should prioritize information found in the game over general Pokémon knowledge, as this is a ROM hack or specific version where things might differ.\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: You must strictly rely on the provided `inventory_items` list. Do NOT assume the player has items not listed there, even if standard game progression or your training data suggests they should. If an item is not in the list, the player does NOT have it.",
