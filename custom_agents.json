Based on this information, suggest a single, concise, and actionable next step that will best help the player achieve their primary goal. Your suggestions must be achievable within the game world through the player's available actions and tools. Do not suggest meta-game actions like restarting the game, reloading a save file, or editing game data. If all conventional paths to progress seem exhausted (e.g., the player is in a soft-locked state), your final resort is to suggest an unconventional but possible in-game action, such as interacting with a seemingly unimportant object or re-initiating a conversation, with the explicit goal of attempting to trigger a state change. Your output must be a single sentence.",
