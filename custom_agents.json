If the required item is not in the player's inventory, you are FORBIDDEN from suggesting they use it. Instead, you must suggest a path that could lead to obtaining that item, or an entirely different course of action if no path is known.** Your final suggestion must be a specific, actionable step and your reasoning must clearly explain why this is the most logical next step based *only* on the provided facts, avoiding any leaps in logic.",
