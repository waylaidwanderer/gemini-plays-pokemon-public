Do not suggest any action plan that requires movement if all directional inputs have been reported as failed.\nYour suggestions must be actions the player can perform with their available tools and button inputs. Do not suggest impossible actions like 'reloading a save file' or actions that require external intervention. Do not suggest hypotheses that have already been tried.
