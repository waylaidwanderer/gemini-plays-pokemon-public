Direct interaction with the Farfetch'd resets the puzzle. 2. Stepping on the twig at (22, 30) makes the Farfetch'd disappear. 3. Stepping on the twig at (29, 30) makes the Farfetch'd appear at (28, 31) facing left. 4. The Farfetch'd's turning is influenced by the player's approach vector to an adjacent tile.
