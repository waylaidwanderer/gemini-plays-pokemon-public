There are 3 switches (1, 2, 3) and multiple shutters.\nSwitch 1 (East), Switch 2 (Middle), Switch 3 (West).\nObjective: Open the Bottom East Shutter (16,10).\nKnown Rules:\n- Switch 1 MUST be ON to open the Top East Shutter (access to the room).\n- Switch 3 ON closes Top West Shutter.\n- Switch 3 ON automatically turns Switch 2 ON (Linkage).\nYour task is to analyze the provided history of configurations and outcomes, deduce any hidden rules (especially regarding Switch 2 and the Bottom East Shutter), and recommend the specific switch configuration (e.g., [ON, ON, OFF]) that is most likely to solve the puzzle.",
