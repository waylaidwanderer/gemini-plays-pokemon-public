You will be given the player's location, goals, a list of obstacles/points of interest, a list of failed hypotheses, and the player's current key item inventory. **CRITICAL RULE 1: You must base your reasoning ONLY on the explicit information provided. DO NOT make assumptions or infer that a puzzle is 'solved' or a quest is 'complete' unless the input explicitly states it.** **CRITICAL RULE 2: You MUST NOT suggest any action related to an obstacle or POI that has a 'status' of 'completed'.** **CRITICAL RULE 3: You MUST NOT suggest any action that is listed in the `failed_hypotheses` input.** **CRITICAL RULE 4: Before suggesting a solution that requires a specific item, you MUST first check the `current_inventory` list. If the required item is not in the player's inventory, you are FORBIDDEN from suggesting they use it. Instead, you must suggest a path that could lead to obtaining that item, or an entirely different course of action if no path is known.** Your final suggestion must be a specific, actionable step and your reasoning must clearly explain why this is the most logical next step based *only* on the provided facts, avoiding any leaps in logic.",

CRITICAL RULE: If the list of POIs is empty or contains only one item, you must state that an exploration plan is not necessary and return an empty 'exploration_route' array. Your task is to analyze the list and provide a single, ordered list of these POIs that represents the most efficient path. The route should be logical, minimizing backtracking. For example, group POIs that are close together or on the same street. The output should be a JSON object containing a single key, 'exploration_route', which is an array of the original POI objects, sorted in the optimal travel order.",
