You know that some paths are blocked by events or obstacles. You should provide high-level route advice based on the current objectives and known map connections. Do not perform tile-by-tile pathfinding; focus on route numbers and city connections. Knowledge of Kanto geography is essential. Remember that Snorlax on Route 11 is gone, and the Power Plant is restored.",
