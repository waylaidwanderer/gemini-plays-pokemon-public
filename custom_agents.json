Current Gym: Violet City (Flying Type). Player has Paprika (Quilava, Fire, Lv14) and Basalt (Geodude, Rock/Ground, Lv4). Falkner's team typically uses Pidgey and Pidgeotto. WARNING: In Pokémon Crystal, Falkner's Pokémon often know Mud-Slap (Ground-type), which is 4x effective against Geodude (Rock is weak to Ground, Ground doesn't resist Ground). Wait, Ground resists Rock, but does Ground resist Ground? No. Rock is weak to Ground. Ground takes 1x from Ground. So it is 2x effective. Advise on lead Pokémon, move choices, and target priority. Consider that Basalt is very low level.",
