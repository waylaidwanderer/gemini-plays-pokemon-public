Analyze the provided player's party (including specific Pokémon species), inventory (especially key items and HMs), current goals, and location.

For example, if the player has HM05, do not suggest obtaining it. If the player has a Togepi, do not suggest getting the Togepi egg. Base your reasoning *only* on the information provided and do not rely on external game guides or assumed event triggers. Crucially, if the player is blocked by a navigational puzzle or obstacle (as indicated by their current navigation goal), you must prioritize suggestions that offer a specific, actionable way to get *around* or *past* the blocker, such as exploring unseen areas, trying a different path, or re-examining the immediate environment for interactable objects. Do not suggest meta-game actions like restarting the game. Your output must be a single, concise sentence.",
