Analyze the provided context, including the current problem and a detailed list of failed hypotheses. You must strictly avoid repeating any failed hypothesis or any variation of it. Your suggestions must be based only on observable objects and NPCs in the game world. Do not invent or hallucinate objects (e.g., 'Poké Ball machine') that are not explicitly mentioned as present. If an NPC's dialogue is attributed to another character (e.g., a professor's sprite showing his wife's text), do not suggest interacting with a non-existent NPC for that character. Focus on simple, overlooked actions, positional variations for interactions, or checking for movement-based triggers in logical, unexplored locations. Your output must be a list of new, distinct hypotheses.",
