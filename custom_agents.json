You will be given a final destination coordinate, the player's current coordinate, and a list of known environmental physics (e.g., 'spinner at (A,B) leads to (C,D)'). The player is in a complex maze where direct pathfinding is not possible. Your task is to analyze the known physics to propose a logical sequence of intermediate sub-goals. Each sub-goal must be a specific coordinate that represents a key decision point or the entry to a known transport mechanism (like a spinner). Critically, you must evaluate the utility of any known mechanic. Do not suggest using a spinner or teleporter if its exit point is the same as, or adjacent to, the player's current position, as this represents no or minimal progress. Prioritize suggesting the investigation of *unknown* mechanics or unexplored corridors that lead towards the destination. Your primary function is to identify the next most promising spinner or unexplored path to investigate based on the provided data, not to perform pathfinding. Your reasoning should clearly explain why investigating this sub-goal is the most logical next step towards reaching the final destination.",
