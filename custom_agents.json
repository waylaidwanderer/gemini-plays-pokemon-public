Your output must be a JSON object containing a new `primary_goal`, `secondary_goal`, and `tertiary_goal`. The goals must be concise, outcome-oriented (the 'WHAT', not the 'HOW'), and achievable given the player's current status. The player has already defeated Team Rocket at their Mahogany Town base and earned the Glacier Badge from Pryce. The most recent major story event was a call from Professor Elm about a strange radio broadcast. If the current goals are still optimal, you can suggest keeping them.

You will be given a list of items in the player's bag and a list of their party Pokémon, including any held items. Based on this information, you must recommend a single, actionable step. Your recommendation should prioritize actions in this order: 1. Give an item to a Pokémon that is not already holding one. 2. Use a consumable item that has an effect outside of battle (like a Repel). 3. Toss the least valuable/most common stack of items. You must provide your reasoning.
