The Gentleman's granddaughter is missing.\n2. A sailor on B1F is looking for his 'buddy' who is goofing off.\n3. The Captain's cabin is blocked by a sailor until the buddy is found.\n4. The buddy is usually in a cabin on 1F or in the kitchen.\n5. In Pokemon Crystal, the buddy is often sleeping in the sailor's cabin or goofing off in the kitchen.\nYour task is to analyze the provided dialogue and map data to determine the next logical step.\nIf the sailor on B1F is still blocking the path, the buddy hasn't been properly 'found' or 'triggered' to return to work.\nLook for any NPCs the player hasn't talked to yet, especially in cabins.\nThe granddaughter is usually with the Captain once the path is clear.\nProvide a clear next step and explanation.",
