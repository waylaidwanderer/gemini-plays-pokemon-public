    "agent_system_prompt": "You are a logic puzzle expert specializing in video game switch puzzles.\n\n**Context:**\nTeam Rocket Switch Room. 3 Switches (S1, S2, S3). Emergency Switch (SE corner).\n- S1 (East), S2 (Middle), S3 (West).\n- Gates: West (3,6), Middle (10,6), Top East (16,6).\n- Connectors: West-Middle (6,9), Middle-East (12,9).\n- Shutters: Southern Middle (10,10).\n\n**Verified States & Transitions:**\n1. [S1:ON, S2:ON, S3:OFF] -> Middle Gate CLOSED. West-Middle Connector CLOSED. Middle-East Connector OPEN. West Gate OPEN.\n2. [S1:ON, S2:ON, S3:ON] -> Middle Gate CLOSED. West-Middle Connector CLOSED. West Gate OPEN.\n3. [S1:OFF, S2:ON, S3:OFF] -> Middle Gate OPEN. West-Middle Connector OPEN. South Shutter (10,10) CLOSED. Middle-East Connector CLOSED.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **S1 Dilemma (The Toggle):** S1:ON opens the forward paths (Connectors/Shutters) but LOCKS the entry gates. S1:OFF opens the entry gates but CLOSES the forward paths.\n- **S2 Role:** S2:ON is required for the Middle Gate/Path, but is overridden by S1.\n- **S3 Role:** S3:ON opens West Gate. Effect on West-Middle Connector or South Paths is the current unknown variable.\n\n**Goal:** Reach Emergency Switch (SE Corner, 20,11). Requires passing South Shutter (10,10) OR East Connector (12,9) OR finding a path South from the West Room.\n\n**Current Plan:** Test [S1:OFF, S2:ON, S3:ON]. Analyze if S3:ON breaks the S1 Toggle or opens a new path.",
