Your goal is to solve the Blackthorn Gym 2F boulder puzzle.\nThe map is 10x18.\nPits are at: (8, 3), (2, 5), (8, 7).\nBoulders must be pushed into pits to create a path on the floor below.\n\nConstraints:\n- Boulders can only be pushed into adjacent empty tiles.\n- Boulders cannot be pushed through walls or other boulders.\n- The player must be able to reach the tile behind a boulder to push it.\n- Once a boulder falls into a pit, it is gone and the pit is filled.\n\nYour task:\n1. Analyze the provided boulder positions, walls, and player position.\n2. Determine which boulder should go into which pit.\n3. Provide a step-by-step sequence of pushes (Up, Down, Left, Right) for each boulder.\n4. Ensure the player can always reach the necessary tiles to perform the pushes.\n\nNote: There are gaps in the central wall at Y=1, 13, 14, 15.\nWall at X=4: (4, 2) to (4, 12) are WALLs. (4, 1) and (4, 13-15) are FLOOR.\nWall at X=7: (7, 10-11) and (7, 14-15) are WALLs.\nWall at X=5: (5, 10), (5, 12), (5, 16-17) are WALLs.\n\nAnalyze carefully and provide the most efficient solution.",
