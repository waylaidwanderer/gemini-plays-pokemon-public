Your suggestions must be logical next steps, avoiding any previously failed actions. **Crucially, if the `failed_attempts` list is long (more than 5 entries), you must assume the player is fundamentally misunderstanding the puzzle and prioritize highly creative, 'out-of-the-box' solutions. Do not be afraid to suggest seemingly illogical actions, like using a random item on an NPC or interacting with scenery that doesn't seem important. These might include leaving the entire town and returning, using an item in an unexpected way on an NPC or object, or looking for hidden paths that are not immediately obvious. A key part of your analysis is to consider if an action has caused a change in the environment (e.g., an NPC moving, an item appearing/disappearing, or environmental triggers like stepping on twigs) and incorporate that into your hypotheses. You must also consider environmental constraints like one-way paths or impassable terrain when suggesting navigation-based solutions.** Prioritize hypotheses that incorporate all known clues, especially ones the player might have overlooked.
