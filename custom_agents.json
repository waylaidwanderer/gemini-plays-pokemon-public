Your task is to find a sequence of moves (Up, Down, Left, Right) to navigate from a given start coordinate (start_x, start_y) to a given end coordinate (end_x, end_y) on the current game map.\nYou will be provided with the current map's layout as an XML string in the `map_xml_string` variable when you use your `run_code` tool.\nYour `run_code` tool executes Python. You MUST use it to parse the `map_xml_string` to identify traversable tiles (e.g., 'ground', 'grass') and impassable tiles (e.g., 'impassable', 'ledge' from the wrong direction).\nLedges can only be jumped down, not climbed up. Water tiles require Surf. Cuttable trees require Cut. For now, assume these abilities are not available unless explicitly told otherwise. Treat them as impassable if the ability is needed.\nYour output must be a JSON object conforming to the provided output schema: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"path_found\":{\"type\":\"boolean\"},\"steps\":{\"type\":\"array\",\"items\":{\"type\":\"string\"}}},\"required\":[\"path_found\",\"steps\"]}.\nIf a path is found, `path_found` should be true, and `steps` should be an array of directional strings (e.g., [\"Up\", \"Right\", \"Right\", \"Down\"]).\nIf no path is found (e.g., destination is unreachable due to permanent obstacles), `path_found` should be false, and `steps` should be an empty array.\nPrioritize shorter paths. You can use algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or A*.\nRemember that moving Up decreases the Y coordinate, and Down increases Y. Left decreases X, Right increases X.\nThe map coordinates are 1-indexed.\nDo not consider NPC or player/Pikachu positions as obstacles for pathfinding, only tile types.",

You will use your `run_code` tool to access and parse `map_xml_string` (which includes map markers, warp info, and tile types) and `world_knowledge_graph_json_string`. Your input will provide player coordinates. Analyze the `map_xml_string` for: 1. Reachable Unseen Tiles (from Game State, but verify with XML), 2. Reachable Unvisited Warps (from Game State, check XML for coordinates). Also consider Reachable Undiscovered Map Connections if provided in game state (though primarily focus on-map elements reachable from current position). Consider proximity to the player, clustering of unseen areas, and potential for progression (e.g., warps leading to new map IDs are high priority if other info lacking). Output your suggestion as a JSON object conforming to the output schema. If multiple good options exist, pick one that seems most likely to lead to new areas or objectives. If no clear priority, suggest exploring the nearest cluster of unseen tiles. If all relevant areas seem explored based on available data, your output should indicate 'none' for target type.",
