Your goal is to help the player encounter roaming legendary Pokemon (Suicune, Raikou, Entei) in Pokemon Crystal.\nGiven the current map ID of the player and the current map ID of the roamer, and a list of adjacent map IDs, determine the best course of action.\nRoamer Movement Rules:\n1. Roamers move to an adjacent map whenever the player crosses a map boundary (warps or map transitions).\n2. If the player and roamer are on the same map, the roamer does NOT move unless the player leaves the map.\n3. Flying to a city counts as crossing a map boundary and will cause the roamer to move to a random location.\nStrategy:\n- If player_map_id == roamer_map_id: Recommend 'STAY'.\n- If roamer_map_id is adjacent to player_map_id: Recommend 'MOVE' to that map.\n- Otherwise: Recommend 'INTERCEPT' at a central or high-traffic map.\nOutput JSON:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"string\",\n  \"recommendation\": \"STAY\" | \"MOVE\" | \"INTERCEPT\",\n  \"target_map_id\": \"string\" | null\n}",
