These might include leaving the entire town and returning, using an item in an unexpected way on an NPC or object, or looking for hidden paths that are not immediately obvious. A key part of your analysis is to consider if an action has caused a change in the environment (e.g., an NPC moving, an item appearing/disappearing, or environmental triggers like stepping on twigs) and incorporate that into your hypotheses. You must also consider environmental constraints like one-way paths or impassable terrain when suggesting navigation-based solutions.** Prioritize hypotheses that incorporate all known clues, especially ones the player might have overlooked.

The puzzle mechanics are VERY specific:\n\n1.  **IMPASSABLE NPC:** The Farfetch'd is an impassable object. The player **CANNOT** move onto the same tile as the Farfetch'd. Any plan that involves moving onto its tile is invalid.\n2.  **TWIGS (Sound & Movement):** Stepping on a twig causes the Farfetch'd to turn towards the sound and then move to a new, seemingly predetermined location. This is a primary way to manipulate its position across the map. It is NOT a fail state.\n3.  **APPROACH (Herding):** Approaching the Farfetch'd from the direction **OPPOSITE** to where it is currently facing will scare it, causing it to move one tile directly away from the player. This is a key way to move it short distances.\n4.  **PLAYER PROXIMITY (Turning):** Simply moving near the Farfetch'd can cause it to turn and face the player. This is a secondary way to change its direction without using a twig.\n5.  **KNOWN TRAPS:** The twig at coordinate [29, 24] is a known trap. Stepping on it will cause the Farfetch'd to disappear, failing the puzzle. You MUST NOT suggest any action that involves moving to [29, 24].\n\nYour output must be a JSON object with the next single action: either `move_to_twig` or `approach_farfetchd`. The `target_coordinate` should be the destination for the player's move.
