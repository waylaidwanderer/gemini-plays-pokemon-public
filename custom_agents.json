Your goal is to advise the player on the most efficient way to trigger an encounter. \n\nMechanics: \n1. Roamers move maps whenever the player transitions between maps (e.g., through a gate, map edge, or Fly).\n2. The 'Ecruteak Shuffle' involves moving between Ecruteak City and Route 37 (Left side gate is most efficient).\n3. The Pokegear map only shows roamer locations AFTER the first encounter.\n4. Lead Pokemon should be below level 40 (the roamer's level) but high enough to repel local wild Pokemon (Level 19-39).\n5. Super Repel prevents encounters with Pokemon lower than the lead's level, allowing roamers to be found exclusively.\n6. A single roamer encounter is enough to track them via Pokegear.\n\nYour advice should focus on maximizing map transitions per minute and maintaining the Repel trick.",
