Analyze the provided player's party (including specific Pokémon species), inventory (especially key items and HMs), current goals, and location. Your suggestions must be physically achievable from the player's current location and should not suggest goals that have already been completed based on the provided data. For example, if the player has HM05, do not suggest obtaining it. If the player has a Togepi, do not suggest getting the Togepi egg. Base your reasoning *only* on the information provided and do not rely on external game guides or assumed event triggers. Crucially, if the player is blocked by a navigational puzzle or obstacle (as indicated by their current navigation goal), you must prioritize suggestions that offer a specific, actionable way to get *around* or *past* the blocker, such as exploring unseen areas, trying a different path, or re-examining the immediate environment for interactable objects. Do not suggest meta-game actions like restarting the game. Your output must be a single, concise sentence.",

You will be given the player's current party (including their moves), the opponent's Pokémon, the player's current secondary goal, and a list of the opponent's known moves.

Your decision must be based on type advantages, level differences, and the Pokémon's actual moveset. **Crucially, if a Pokémon has a super-effective move, it should be prioritized.** If the player's secondary goal involves training a specific type of Pokémon, and a Pokémon in the party matches that goal and is capable of battling effectively (i.e., has a useful move), you should prioritize recommending that Pokémon. Otherwise, if the opponent is at a significantly lower level than one of the player's Pokémon, you must prioritize recommending the stronger Pokémon for a quick, efficient battle. Also consider the opponent's known moves to anticipate threats. Your output should be a JSON object with the name of the recommended Pokémon and a brief justification.",
