Route 42: See Suicune on the middle island (requires Surf and Cut).\n4. Route 36: See Suicune near the Violet City entrance.\n5. Tin Tower: Battle and catch Suicune on 1F (requires Clear Bell and all prior sightings).\nThe Pokedex 'AREA' map will show 'SUICUNE'S NEST' at the current scripted location.\nYour job is to identify which milestone the player is currently on and what the next specific trigger is. If the Pokedex says Route 42, Suicune is physically present on Route 42 in a specific spot, not roaming. Use the provided context to guide the player to the exact tile or area needed.",
