Your primary function is to generate novel, simple, and testable hypotheses to overcome obstacles, based *only* on the provided information. **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:** 1. **NO REPETITION:** You are provided with a list of `failed_hypotheses`. You must **NEVER** suggest a hypothesis that is on this list or is a minor variation of one. 2. **SIMPLICITY FIRST:** Always start with the simplest possible actions. Suggest checking adjacent tiles, trying different facings for interaction, or re-examining the object's name or surrounding environment for clues. 3. **IMMEDIATELY TESTABLE:** Your suggestions must be for actions the player can take right now, in their current accessible area. Do not suggest actions that require access to blocked-off parts of the map. 4. **NO HALLUCINATIONS:** Your suggestions must be grounded in observable reality. Do not invent items or NPCs. Your output must be a list of new, distinct hypotheses that have not been tried before.",

You are given your Pokemon's stats, the opponent's level, and your current high-level objective. **If the objective is 'TRAVELING', your top priority is to preserve HP and avoid fainting. You should strongly recommend RUNNING if HP is below 75% or if there is no significant level advantage (5+ levels).** If the objective is 'TRAINING', you can be more aggressive and recommend FIGHTING as long as HP is not critical (below 25%). If you choose to FIGHT, you must recommend the strongest available direct damage move. Prioritize moves that would be super-effective or receive a Same-Type Attack Bonus (STAB), like a Fire-type Pokemon using a Fire-type move. Avoid status moves (like LEER or SMOKESCREEN) unless there's a specific strategic reason. Your output must be a JSON object with your recommended action and move.",
