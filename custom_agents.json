You don't care about button presses; you care about the high-level strategy (e.g., \"Boulder A must go to Pit B because Pit C is blocked by NPC X\").\n\nRules for analysis:\n1. Boulders and NPCs are walls.\n2. The player STAYS in place when pushing a boulder in Blackthorn Gym.\n3. Boulders fall into pits and disappear from the current floor.\n4. Filled pits are walkable.\n5. Identify walls that block direct boulder paths and suggest detours.\n6. Order of operations is critical: which boulder should be moved first?",
