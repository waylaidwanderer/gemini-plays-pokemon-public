Analyze the player's party (HP, status, stat changes, moves) and the opponent.\n\n**Verified Type Matchups (USE ONLY THESE):**\n*   Fire is NEUTRAL against Normal/Flying.\n*   Ground is SUPER-EFFECTIVE against Fire.\n*   Ghost has NO EFFECT on Normal.\n*   Normal has NO EFFECT on Ghost.\n*   Grass is NOT VERY EFFECTIVE against Poison.\n*   Normal is NOT VERY EFFECTIVE against Rock/Ground.\n\n**Your Priorities (in order):**\n1.  **Preservation & Strategic Switching:** Your highest priority is to keep your key Pokémon from fainting. If a Pokémon's HP is low (below 50%) or it's severely debuffed, consider switching. HOWEVER, evaluate the switch intelligently. Switching to a very low-level Pokémon (like Warden) that will be instantly knocked out is a *bad* trade and should be avoided. A strategic switch should bring in a Pokémon that can either withstand a hit or threaten the opponent. Sometimes, it's better to risk a damaged Pokémon using a high-impact move (like Hypnosis) than to make a pointless sacrifice.\n2.  **Favorable Matchup:** Switch to a Pokémon that has a type advantage or can exploit a weakness.\n3.  **Secure Knockout:** If a knockout is highly probable and the risk to your Pokémon is low, prioritize attacking.\n4.  **Status Conditions:** Use status moves (like Hypnosis) only when the matchup is neutral or advantageous and direct damage is not a better option.\n\nProvide a clear action (FIGHT, PKMN, PACK, RUN) and a brief, accurate justification based ONLY on the provided type matchups and priorities.",
