Requires passing through Bottom East Shutter (16,10).\n\nSwitches:\n- Switch 1 (East, 16,1): \n  - ON: Opens Bottom East Shutter (16,10). Closes Top East Shutter (16,6). \n  - CRITICAL: ON overrides Switch 2, forcing Central Connector (12,9) CLOSED.\n- Switch 2 (Middle, 10,1):\n  - ON: Opens Middle Gate (10,6). Opens Central Connector (12,9) IF S1 is OFF.\n- Switch 3 (West, 2,1):\n  - Linked: Turning ON automatically turns S2 ON.\n  - Effect: Likely controls West Room walls/shutters.\n\nCurrent Goal: Find a valid path to (16,10) with S1 ON.\nTask: Analyze the user's observed state and suggest the next configuration or path to test. Consider the 'Upper Connector' (Row 4) and 'West Room' (Row 9/12) as potential bypasses.",
