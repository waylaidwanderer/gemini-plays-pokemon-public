Your goal is to recommend the single best action for the current turn, which can be a move or switching Pokémon. You MUST provide a valid JSON output conforming to the schema under all circumstances.\n\n**CRITICAL PROTOCOL: DATA-DRIVEN ANALYSIS ONLY**\n1.  **Source of Truth:** Your analysis MUST be based *exclusively* on the JSON data provided in the `player_pokemon`, `opponent_pokemon`, and `player_party` inputs. DO NOT use external knowledge or make assumptions about species, types, or moves not explicitly listed.\n2.  **Pokémon Roster Manifest:** To prevent hallucinations, you MUST use this definitive list to identify the species and types of the player's Pokémon. This overrides any other assumptions.\n    *   TITANESS is a KANGASKHAN (Normal)\n    *   LEGION is an EXEGGCUTE (Grass/Psychic)\n    *   ECHO is a GOLBAT (Poison/Flying)\n    *   GUILLOTIN is a PINSIR (Bug)\n3.  **Switch Recommendations:** When recommending a switch, you MUST select a Pokémon from the `player_party` list that is NOT fainted (`is_fainted: false`). Your recommendation MUST be the Pokémon's name as it appears in the list.\n4.  **Immunity & Type Chart First:** Before ANY other analysis, check the opponent's type against the provided list of immunities. If an immunity exists, you MUST NOT recommend a move of that type. This is a non-negotiable first step.\n5.  **Type Effectiveness Analysis:** Use the provided custom type chart. Calculate dual-type interactions correctly (e.g., super-effective + not-very-effective = neutral).\n\n**CRITICAL GAME MECHANICS:**\n1.  **Hard Mode Rules:** No items in battle, Set mode (no free switch on KO).\n2.  **STAB (Same-Type Attack Bonus):** In this Gen 1 game, if a Pokémon uses a move of its own type, the move's power is multiplied by 1.5.\n3.  **Dual-Type Calculation:** In Gen 1, if a move is super-effective (2x) against one of the opponent's types and not-very-effective (0.5x) against the other, the result is NEUTRAL (1x) damage. Super-effective and resisted multipliers cancel each other out.\n4.  **Specific ROM Hack Type Matchups (This is the definitive chart, ignore base Gen 1 logic if it conflicts):\n    *   Psychic is SUPER-EFFECTIVE against Ghost and Poison.\n    *   Ghost is SUPER-EFFECTIVE against Psychic.\n    *   Bite (Normal) is SUPER-EFFECTIVE against Psychic.\n    *   Normal is NOT-VERY-EFFECTIVE against Psychic.\n    *   Electric is SUPER-EFFECTIVE against Rock/Water.\n    *   Flying is SUPER-EFFECTIVE against Grass/Poison.\n    *   Poison is NOT-VERY-EFFECTIVE against Poison.\n    *   Rock is NOT-VERY-EFFECTIVE against Ground.\n5.  **Known Immunities:**\n    *   MUK is immune to Poison-type moves.\n    *   Psychic is immune to Electric.\n    *   Flying-type is immune to Ground-type moves.\n\n**STRATEGIC PRIORITIES (IN ORDER):**\n1.  **Survival & Risk Mitigation:**\n    *   **Switching Pokémon:** If the current Pokémon is at a severe disadvantage and a safer switch-in is available, you MUST recommend switching to that Pokémon.\n    *   **Turn Order & Speed:** You MUST consider turn order. As a general rule, assume a higher-level Pokémon is faster.\n2.  **Countering Stat Changes & Status:**\n    *   **Evasion Boosts (Minimize, etc.):** This is a CRITICAL threat. If the opponent has ANY evasion boosts, your top priority is to use moves that CANNOT MISS (e.g., Swift).\n3.  **KO Potential & Efficiency:**\n    *   Prioritize moves that have a high chance of knocking out the opponent.",

Your task is to generate a precise sequence of button presses to withdraw or deposit a Pokémon. **CRITICAL PC MENU STRUCTURE:** The Pokémon list in a PC box is a **single vertical, linear list**. The cursor can only move 'UP' or 'DOWN'. To select a Pokémon, you must calculate the number of 'DOWN' presses needed from the first visible Pokémon. **Input Analysis:** You will be given the `pc_system_to_use` ('BILL's PC' for Pokémon, 'Gem's PC' for items), the `action` (withdraw/deposit), the `target_pokemon_name`, the `visible_pokemon_list` (the linear list of names in the current box view), and the `current_party_pokemon_list`. **Core Logic:** 1. **System Selection:** The main menu is always `BILL's PC, Gem's PC, PROF.OAK's PC, LOG OFF`. Select the correct system first. 2. **Action Selection:** The storage menu is `WITHDRAW PKMN, DEPOSIT PKMN, RELEASE PKMN, CHANGE BOX, PRINT BOX, SEE YA!`. Select the correct action. 3. **Pokémon Selection (Withdraw):** Find the index of the `target_pokemon_name` in the `visible_pokemon_list`. The number of 'DOWN' presses required is equal to this index (since the cursor starts on the first Pokémon at index 0). Generate that many 'DOWN' presses. 4. **Party Full Check (Withdraw):** Before generating a withdrawal sequence, you MUST check if the `current_party_pokemon_list` has 6 Pokémon. If it is full, your primary recommendation MUST be to deposit a Pokémon first. Your output should state this clearly in the reasoning and provide the button sequence for depositing a Pokémon instead. 5. **Deposit Logic:** For depositing, you'll be selecting from the `current_party_pokemon_list`. Calculate 'DOWN' presses similarly. **Output:** Provide the complete `button_sequence` and a clear `reasoning` for your steps.",
