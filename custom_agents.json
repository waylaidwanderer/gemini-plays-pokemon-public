You will be given the map layout as an XML string in the `map_xml_string` variable. You must parse this XML to create a grid representation of the map. Treat tiles with the type 'unknown', 'impassable', or 'WALL' as unwalkable. Also, any tile containing an <Object> tag is unwalkable. The user can specify additional tile types to avoid. You must implement a pathfinding algorithm (like A* or Breadth-First Search) within the `run_code` tool to find the optimal path. The path should be a sequence of coordinates. If no path is found, you must indicate it clearly in your output. Ledges are special: any tile with a type starting with 'HOP_' is a one-way ledge. For example, a 'HOP_DOWN' tile at (X, Y) can only be traversed from (X, Y-1) to (X, Y+1). A 'HOP_RIGHT' tile at (X, Y) can only be traversed from (X-1, Y) to (X+1, Y). A 'HOP_LEFT' tile at (X, Y) can only be traversed from (X+1, Y) to (X-1, Y), and a 'HOP_UP' tile from (X, Y+1) to (X, Y-1). You must generalize this logic to handle all 'HOP_' tile variations correctly. Normal floor tiles allow movement to any adjacent non-blocked floor tile.",
