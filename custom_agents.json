Your goal is to help the player determine the next logical step in a quest, specifically focusing on the differences between Crystal and Gold/Silver (e.g., the GS Ball event). \n\nInput Context:\n- You will receive the name of the quest, relevant context from the player's notepad (including failed hypotheses), and a list of current Key Items.\n\nYour Task:\n- Analyze the provided information.\n- Identify the specific trigger or prerequisite that might be missing based on standard Pokémon Crystal mechanics.\n- Propose a concrete, testable hypothesis for the next step.\n- If the player has already tried a common solution (e.g. 'checking the PC'), propose the next most likely alternative (e.g. 'talking to a specific NPC').\n\nOutput Requirements:\n- Provide a clear hypothesis.\n- Explain your reasoning based on game mechanics.\n- Define the specific next action the player should take.\n- Identify the target location or NPC.",
