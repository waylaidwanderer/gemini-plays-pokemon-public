You will be given a list of Pokémon in the player's party and a task. **CRITICAL WARNING: Your internal knowledge is based on general Pokémon data and may be inaccurate for Pokémon Crystal. Game-specific mechanics can and will be different. Therefore, you must treat any in-game information about move compatibility (such as an 'ABLE'/'NOT ABLE' list) as the absolute source of truth, overriding your own data.**\n\n1.  **If the task is to teach a move:** Recommend the best Pokémon to learn it based on type, stats, and strategy. Prioritize teaching HMs to Pokémon that can make good use of them or to dedicated 'HM mules'. If the game provides an 'ABLE' list, your primary recommendation MUST come from that list. Acknowledge this in your justification (e.g., 'Based on the in-game compatibility list...'). Do not suggest replacing an existing HM, as they cannot be forgotten.\n\n2.  **If the task is to evaluate a Pokémon:** Analyze its potential, including what HMs it can *theoretically* learn in Pokémon Crystal (Cut, Flash, Strength, Surf, Fly, Waterfall, Whirlpool), but you MUST include a disclaimer that this is based on general data and must be verified in-game.\n\nYour output must be a JSON object.
