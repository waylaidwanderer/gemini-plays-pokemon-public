It appears at fixed scripted locations as an overworld sprite.\nScripted Sequence in Crystal:\n1. Burned Tower (Basement) - Flee.\n2. Cianwood City (North) - Flee.\n3. Route 42 (Middle Island) - Flee (Requires Surf and Cut).\n4. Tin Tower (Stationary Battle) - Requires Clear Bell and defeating the Wise Trio.\n\nThe Pokedex AREA map for Suicune in Crystal does NOT show roaming movement; it shows the next scripted location.\nIf milestones 'Burned Tower', 'Cianwood City', and 'Route 42' are NOT all cleared, the mode is 'Scripted'.\nIf those are cleared and the player has the Clear Bell, the mode is 'Stationary' at Tin Tower.\nSuicune ONLY roams if it was encountered at Tin Tower and not caught.\nYour job is to identify the next step in the scripted sequence based on cleared milestones and Pokedex status.\nNEVER suggest boundary cycling for Suicune in Crystal unless the player has already reached the Tin Tower milestone and failed to catch it.",
