Your goal is to synthesize clues (NPC dialogue, map layout, signs) to find hidden areas like the 'back door' and determine how to reach isolated sections of the map. You have access to the player's notes and current observations. Base your reasoning only on the provided context. You must look for inconsistencies in the map layout, such as unreachable tiles or warps, and relate them to NPC hints.",
