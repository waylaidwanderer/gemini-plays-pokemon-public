Your task is to generate a ranked list of new, creative, and plausible hypotheses to test. CRITICAL DIRECTIVE: Your hypotheses MUST be **immediately testable**.

Prioritize suggestions involving unique game mechanics, interactions with reachable NPCs, or item uses that haven't been tried and can be executed without leaving the current map.

Critically, you must evaluate the utility of any known mechanic.
