DO NOT make assumptions or infer that a puzzle is 'solved' or a quest is 'complete' unless the input explicitly states it.** For example, if an item or NPC 'disappears', do not assume this means success; it could be a puzzle reset or a bug. Your suggestion must be a specific, actionable step (e.g., 'Return to Ilex Forest and check if the Farfetch'd has reappeared at its starting position') and your reasoning must clearly explain why this is the most logical next step based *only* on the provided facts, avoiding any leaps in logic.",

You will be given a description of a puzzle, including observations about objects, their positions, and the results of interactions.

CRITICAL RULE 1: You MUST analyze the `puzzle_description` and the `failed_hypotheses` list. Your suggested `test_plan` MUST NOT repeat any action that has already been performed. Suggesting a redundant action is a critical failure. CRITICAL RULE 2: Your suggested 'test_plan' must ONLY include actions that can be performed within the game using standard controls (directional buttons, A, B, Start, Select). You are FORBIDDEN from suggesting actions that involve saving, quitting, restarting the game/console, or any other meta-game action. CRITICAL RULE 3: Your suggested 'test_plan' must be executable from the player's current area. Assume the player may be confined and unable to reach distant parts of the map. Do not suggest traveling to a location unless you are certain it is reachable. **NEW HEURISTIC:** When new objects, NPCs, or paths appear as a result of an action, your next hypothesis should prioritize interacting with these new elements.

Your task is to analyze this list and suggest the coordinates of the most promising **seen and traversable tile** that provides access to the closest or largest cluster of unseen tiles. Your reasoning MUST prioritize the closest cluster of unseen tiles to the player's current position. CRITICAL RULE: Your suggested target tile **MUST NOT** be an unseen tile itself. It must be a known, seen, and traversable tile adjacent to the target exploration area. Your logic must be as follows: 1. Identify the closest cluster of unseen tiles to the player. 2. From that cluster, identify the single closest unseen tile. 3. The final `target_x` and `target_y` you output MUST be a tile that is ADJACENT to that closest unseen tile, but is NOT on the unseen list itself. You must infer which adjacent tiles are seen. For example, if the closest unseen tile is (15, 9) and the player is at (20, 9), the adjacent tile (16, 9) is the logical seen entry point. Suggesting an unseen tile is a critical failure.",

Your analysis must be methodical. CRITICAL HEURISTIC: When diagnosing a failure on a simple, verifiable test case (like a one-tile move on a flat surface), you MUST prioritize debugging fundamental logic first. This includes, but is not limited to: boundary checks, loop conditions, variable assignments, coordinate system indexing (0-indexed vs 1-indexed), and basic obstacle detection. DO NOT focus on complex edge cases like one-way tiles (ledges) until all fundamental logic has been proven correct. Explain the bug clearly in your diagnosis.
